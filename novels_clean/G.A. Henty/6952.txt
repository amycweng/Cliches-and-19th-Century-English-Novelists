cruelty to be exposed in quiet despair without thought of resistance to save life there may have be tumult in of town a in antwerp where lowest part of mob went into cathedral church destroyed shrine image a to armed resistance to spaniard there have be none first expedition that prince of orange made into country be composed of german mercenary with small body of exile be scarce joined by of country folk though a know gained one little victory be nigh killed cut to piece so horrible be slaughter perpetrated by soldier of tyrannical spanish governor alva when prince of orange again marched

free from tyrant ay there be not protestant in land must go willingly to think of such cruelty make blood run through vein a if be lad again why in mary time there be two three score burnt for religion here in england thought that terrible thing three million of people why be a many a have got in island what think of mate be past understanding old sailor said be too awful for to take in be said put in king of france have leagued with philip of spain that two have bound to exterminate protestant in dominion a includes spain france italy low country most of germany stand to reason a who be protestant ought to help friend for may be sure neighbour that if philip succeeds in low country will never rest until have tried to bring england under rule also to plant inquisition with bonfire rack torture here angry murmur of assent ran round circle must fight may be sure captain martin said to last spain be mighty power know that there be soldier in europe can stand against pikemen if low country number a many soul a can not make stand against with advantage of river swamp dyke fortified town what chance must have who have none of thing what say comrade be have got to fight spain know grudge philip bear be far better that must go over fight spaniard in low country side by side with people there with advantage that river dyke give with comfort that wife child be safe here at home than wait till spain have crushed down netherlands exterminated people be then able with france a ally to turn whole strength against be what say say right captain martin if be queen majesty must send word to philip tomorrow to call off black crew of monk inquisitor people of netherlands have thought of resisting rule of spain must be a have be before philip obedient subject if must leave religion alone be doings of inquisition have driven to despair when one hears what be telling that king have ordered whole population to be exterminated man woman child wonder be preparing to fight to last for be better to die fighting thousand time than be to be roasted alive with wife child suppose queen councillor see that if be to meddle in business might cost kingdom liberty captain said spaniard must put say seventy eighty thousand trained soldier in field while except queen own bodyguard there be not soldier in england while navy be big enough to take fifteen twenty ship queen have to break up to burn galley fire be true enough captain martin agreed english men have fought well on plain of france before now believe must fight worse today beat french when be ten to one against over over what father did can do what say about navy be true also have big fleet have vessel worth speaking about be a good sailor a spaniard day a good fighter though be not saying must stop fleet if came sailing up thames believe when landed must show that be a good men a might bring seventy thousand soldier there must be seven hundred thousand englishman to meet if have stick stone to fight with must not find that must have easy victory yes be what think think neighbour see have not got responsibility of queen have to think for though for one must be right glad if gave word for war may well hesitate before take step might bring ruin worse than ruin upon subject must own too that much a feel for people of low country in distress have not always acted wisely that must take up arm against cruel tyrant even if have chance of beating be what agree must be right natural when mob of antwerp broke into cathedral destroyed altar carving tore up vestment threw down mane saint then did same in other church in town in country round behaved worse than child showed a intolerant bigoted a spaniard angered philip beyond hope of forgiveness gave something like excuse for cruelty towards ay ay be bad business captain martin agreed very bad business comrade although thing be done by mere handful of scum of town respectable citizen raised hand to stop although can turn out town guard readily enough to put stop to quarrel between member of two of guild there be plenty of men who have banded together under name of 'the beggar swore to fight for religion to have put fellow down if have chosen did not choose now philip vengeance will fall on alike well what think of business ned one of captain said turning to lad who be standing in corner remaining a in duty bound silent in presence of elder until addressed be dutchman living under tyranny ned said passionately must rise fight to death rather than see family martyred if none other must rise with must take sword go out slay first spaniard met again until be killed bravo ned well spoken lad three four of captain said father shook head be word of hot youth ned be living there must do a others keep quiet till executioner came to drag away seeing that did a say must use knife against spaniard must give butcher pretext for slaughtering of hundred of innocent people lad looked down abashed at reproof then said well father if must not rise in arm slay spaniard then be killed must leave home join sea beggar under la marck there be more reason in father replied though la marck be ferocious noble follower make not very close inquiry whether ship attack be spanish of other people still be hard for man to starve when time pass can light upon spanish merchantman one can not blame too sorely if take what require out of other passing ship there be reason at bottom of what say did men of sea coast seeing that life of family be now at mercy of spaniard take to ship with dear to continually harass spaniard must work great harm must need large fleet to overpower that with great difficulty seeing that know coast river channel must take refuge in willow where spaniard must not follow at present seems to people be in such depth of despair that have not heart for such enterprise believe that day other impulse will be given more wholesale butchery than usual will goad to madness word of patriot wake into action then will rise a one man fight until utterly destroyed for can in end triumph over spain be more than human being can hope then must be speedy about friend martin said say that eighty thousand have be put to death one way since alva came into government ten year there will be scarce able bodied man remaining in low country by way be talking of beggar of sea fleet be lying at present at dover be said that spanish ambassador be making grave complaint to queen on part of master against giving shelter to men whom brand a not only enemy of spain a pirate robber of sea be talking with master sheepshank mariner put in whose ship sailed for thirty year who be alderman know what be going on told that from what hears be like enough that queen will yield to spanish request so long a chooses to remain friend with spain openly thought opinion may be can scarcely allow port to be used by enemy of philip must go sorely against high spirit till council resolve that england will brave whole strength of spain can not disregard remonstrance of philip be bad business neighbour bad business sooner come to end better one doubt that will have to fight spain one of day say that be better to fight while brother of low country can fight by side than to wait till spain having exterminated can turn whole power against there be general chorus of assent then subject changed to rate of freight to northern port grievous need for better marking of willow danger right of seaman wage other matter be discussed until assembly broke up ned sister joined in garden hear constance boy said to elder there have be news from grandfather uncle since have be away word ned mother doe not say much know be greatly troubled anxious about that may well be constance seeing that quiet conduct feebleness aught else avail to protect from rage of spaniard who stay at home here only hear general tale of cruelty done across sea if heard tale that do at port must drive almost to madness not that hear much for have to keep on board ship may not land mingle with people learn enough from merchant who come on board to see about landing of good to make blood boil do right to prevent landing for so fired be sailor blood by tale of massacre be to go ashore must be sure be speedily embroiled with spaniard see how angered friend of father be who be englishman have dutch blood in vein who feel only because be touched by cruelty because people of low country be protestant with be different mother be one of persecuted people belong to a much a to england have friend relation there who be in sore peril who may for aught know have already fallen victim to cruelty of spaniard have will must join beggar of sea must ship with drake cavendish fight spaniard in indian sea say that there englishman be proving better men than haughty don be very sad constance said what can be done something must be done soon ned replied gloomily thing can not go on a be so terrible be state of thing so heavy taxation that in many town trade be suspended in brussels hear alva own capital brewer have refused to brew baker to bake tapster to draw liquor city swarm with multitude of men thrown out of employment spanish soldier have long be without pay for alva think of nothing bloodshed consequently be insolent to officer care little for order insult rob citizen in street assuredly something must come of ere long people despair will become mad fury if rise constance father doe not say nay will assuredly join do best believe that queen will forbid subject to give aid to people of netherlands for allowed many to fight in france for conde protestant against guise will surely do same now since suffering of brother in netherlands have touched nation far more keenly than did of huguenot in france be sixteen now father say that in year will rate a second mate methinks that there be not many men on board who can pull more strongly rope work more stoutly at capstan when heave anchor besides a talk dutch a well a english must be of more use than men who know nought of language of country constance shook head think ned that father must give leave at rate not until have grown up into man look to having with to succeeding day in command of good venture while remains quietly at home with mother ned agreed with sigh fear that be right constance that will have to stick to trade of sailoring if people of netherlands rise against tyrant must be hard to be sailing backwards forward doing peaceful trade between london holland whilst friend relative be battling for life fortnight later good venture filled

with be doubtless included in denunciation be easy enough have only to get into boat after dark to muffle oar to row for haarlem lie ten mile away have declared for prince of orange like to leave ship for if found gone might seize declare confiscated although when got back to england might lay complaint before queen there must be chance of getting ship value from spaniard there be so many cause of complaint between two nation that seizure of brig must make difference one way question be must get out must be easy matter peter said shaking head that french ship came in afternoon have taken up berth outside there must be no getting out until moved out of way if be not there might be tried though must be difficult to do so without attracting attention a for spanish war vessel of there be four in port must not fear if once got sail up for venture can sail faster than lubberly spaniard must send rowboat after unless wind be strong must speedily overhaul well must think over captain martin said must be sorry indeed to lose ship must be well nigh ruin to if there be other way must make for haarlem by boat next day work of unloading continued in afternoon captain of french ship

shift berth ship length one way other will do for certainly will with pleasure captain replied will give order at once will never do captain martin said be more easy about because know that a long a ship be there can not get out if saw shifting berth must strike at once might be intending to slip away must wait until get perfectly dark then throw off warp slacken out cable a silently a possible let drop down so a to leave easy passage a soon a be dark will grease block when everything be quiet try to get out what wind there be be from southwest will take well down zuider zee hope may succeed french captain said once under sail must be safe from warship for must be two three mile away before must manage to get up sail danger lie in rowboat galley well well must risk captain martin said will have boat alongside if find case be desperate will take to row to shore make way to haarlem where must be safe ned who have be keeping sharp lookout day observed that two spanish official have taken up station on wharf not far from ship appeared to have nothing to do to be indifferent to what be going on told father that thought that be watching presently merchant came down to wharf did not come on board spoke to captain martin a stood on deck of vessel so that around must hear word how be getting on captain martin asked in dutch fairly well captain martin replied think if push on will

when hears have gone chapter iii fight with spaniard a soon a became dark wharf be deserted captain martin sent two sailor aloft with grease pot with order block be to be carefully greased to ensure running without noise boat rowed six oar be lowered noiselessly into water flannel be bound round oar men who have be aware of danger threatened captain sharpened pike ax declared to other that whether captain ordered not spaniard must set foot on board a long a one of stood alive on deck cook filled great boiler with water lighted fire under carpenter heated caldron of pitch without order be doing thompson captain asked noticing glow of fire a came out of cabin sailor came aft before replied be just cooking up little hot sauce for don captain ask to come know if do be only right that must entertain hope there will be fighting lad captain said well honour that ai exactly wish of mate after what have be hearing of feel a sha' be happy until have have brush with 'ere spaniard a to fighting honour from what have heard captain hawkins others out in indian sea have be ashowing that though may swagger on land ai match for englishman on sea anyhow honour ai going to stand by see master ned carried away by 'ere butchering spaniard have made up mind that what happens to happens to of have sailed together in ship good venture for last seventeen eighteen year mean to swim sink together disrespect to captain be fixed intention of of must be nice thing for to sail back to port of london say a stood by saw captain son carried off to be hung burnt what not by spaniard then sailed home to tell tale mean disrespect captain say again in 'ere business take order from mr peter seeing that being consarned a be in affair ai to be considered a having so to speak right judgment upon well well will see if there be chance of making successful fight captain martin said unable to resist smile at sailor way of putting night be dark two three oil lamp that hung suspended from of house facing port threw ray of light extended to shipping be difficult to make out against sky outline of mast of french vessel lying twenty yard away presently ned attention be called towards by slight splash of cable then heard low rumble a rope ran out through hawse hole saw that mast be slowly moving in two three minute have disappeared from sight went into cabin frenchman have gone father so noiselessly that must hardly hear if can get out a quietly there be little fear of being noticed can not be a quiet a ned have only to slack away cable drift with tide turned hour ago have got to tow out set sail however night be dark wind be off shore everything be in favour do see if there be anyone about on deck of ship above below ned went first on to stern then to bow must hear voice of men talking singing in forecastle must hear movement on deck of ship went down reported to father then think may a well start at once ned there be still sound noise in town noise may make be therefore le likely to be noticed than if waited until everything be perfectly still sailor be ready be barefooted so a to move a noiselessly a possible four small cannon that good venture carried have be loaded to muzzle with bullet piece of iron search have be made below several heavy lump of stone part of ballast carried on former occasion brought up placed at interval along bulwark pike have be fastened by loose lashing to mast ax leaned in readiness against cannon now peter captain martin said boat be manned do send man ashore to cast off hawser at bow let take line ashore with so a to ease hawser off not let end fall in water moment have done let come to stern get on board there do get plank on board a noiselessly a can a soon a bow hawser be on board will give men in boat word to row ned will be on board see that row in right direction moment have got plank in get out knife cut stern warp half through directly head be out feel strain sever stern be so close to wharf that end will not be able to drop down into water make splash ned order be that a soon a vessel head pointed seaward be to steer rather to right so a to prevent stream however ran feebly from carrying down on bow of french ship once beyond latter be to go straight out steering by light on shore men be enjoined to drop oar a quietly a possible into water at stroke to row deeply a having vessel in tow must churn up water unless did so boat rowed off stroke two then a rope tightened men sat quiet until captain martin be heard to give order to row in low tone then bent to oar peter have chosen six best rower on board ship for purpose so quietly did dip oar in water captain martin must scarce hear sound only knew by looking over other side seeing that shore be receding that ship be in motion two minute later peter came forward have cut warp captain martin be moving out have left watson at helm scarce word be spoken for next five minute be only by looking at light ashore that must judge progress be making one breathed more freely now first danger be over have got out from berth without attracting slightest notice from shore from ship lying next to next danger be from ship lying at anchor off port waiting turn to come in be to run against one of sound of collision perhaps breaking of spar shout of crew must certainly excite attention from sentry on shore so far boat have be rowing short distance in advance of end of bowsprit captain martin now made way out to end of spar told ned that be going to give good deal more rope in order that might keep well ahead that be to keep sharp lookout for craft at anchor quarter of hour passed captain martin thought that must now be beyond line of outer shipping felt wind more now that be getting beyond shelter of town effect upon hull spar made work lighter for in boat ahead now peter think that can safely spread foresail call in from boat sail have be already loosed be now let fall bellied out at once haul in sheet lad captain martin said going forward gave low whistle minute later boat be alongside let drop astern peter captain said a ned rower clambered on board may want presently hullo what be that be one of guard boat do believe coming way men heard sound of coming oar silently stole to mast armed with pike put ax in belt ranged along by side of ship towards boat be approaching will go ahead of astern captain martin whispered to mate can not tell yet sir by sound seems making pretty nearly straight for how unfortunate captain martin murmured just a seemed that be getting safely away in minute mate whispered will go astern of sir not by much trust that will not see captain said now be away from town light doe seem so dark besides eye be accustomed to there be dead silence in ship a boat approached be just passing stern at distance of about ship length when there be sudden exclamation voice shouted what ship be that where be going captain martin replied in dutch be taking advantage of wind to make to sea down with sail sir officer shouted be against regulation ship be permitted to leave port between sunrise sunset pull alongside lad there be something strange about come alongside captain martin said sternly be peaceable trader who meddle with one if interfere with will be worse for insolent officer exclaimed furiously do dare to threaten blow match lad shoulder arquebus there be treason rebellion here on board saw six tiny spark appear two in bow four in stern minute later boat dashed alongside a did so three great piece of stone be cast into knocking down two of rower fire officer exclaimed a sprang up to climb ship side six musket be discharged men rose to follow leader when there be cry from rower boat be sinking be staved in at same moment officer fell back thrust through with pike two of soldier be cut down with ax other sprang back into sinking boat at once drifted astern up with sail lad captain martin shouted be question of speed now alarm be spread on shore already sentry of various battery be discharging musket shouting roll of drum be heard almost immediately crew soon have stitch of sail set upon brig be moving steadily through water wind be still light although occasionally stronger puff gave ground for hope that must ere long blow harder will be time before make out what be about peter captain martin said galley will be manned will row to spot where firing be heard of men in boat be sure to be able to swim will meet a come out tell have happened worst of be moon will be up in few minute forgot about account for being lighter however have got good start one two guard boat may be out here in quarter of hour will take galley twice a long to gather crew get out depends on wind be lucky be not light yet battery might open on think now will get sight of until be fairly out of range now that there be longer occasion for silence on board good venture crew laughed joked at expense of spaniard be in high spirit at success only regret be that brush with pursuer have not be more serious one be evident from talk that there be quite a much hope a fear in glance that cast astern that must have be by mean sorry to see foe of about own strength in hot pursuit of quarter of hour after shattered boat have dropped astern moon rose on starboard bow be three quarter full must assuredly reveal ship to on shore scarcely indeed did show above horizon when there be boom of gun astern followed second two later by heavy splash in water close alongside be good shot captain martin said luck rather than skill fancy there be little chance of hitting at distance must be mile half away think so peter quite that captain must have given gun lot of elevation to carry so far almost wonder wasted powder of course ca tell in least who be firing at captain said can not have learnt anything yet can have only known that there be firing off port that craft be making out may be one of sea beggar vessel for anything know may have come in to carry off prize from under very nose be so mate replied gun may have be fired a signal a much a with hope of hitting so may so may peter did not think of certainly be likely enough know have several ship cruising in zuider zee keeping lookout for beggar on night like with wind astern sound will be heard mile away may have trouble yet be not much afraid of galley for though wind be so light be running along famously see have nothing in hold be in favour so long a be dead before wind besides if galley did come up must probably be singly must be able to beat off for high out of water a be must find difficult to climb side if fall in with of ship be different matter altogether four five more shot be fired fell astern a be fully two mile half away when last gun be discharged cannoneer must have known that be far out of range captain martin felt sure that mate idea be correct one that cannon have be discharged rather a signal than with hope of reaching ned run up into foretop captain said keep sharp lookout ahead moon have given advantage to who be on track behind give advantage a against craft there may be ahead of will see long before can see peter have be looking astern when last gun be fired said that by flash believed that have caught sight of three craft of kind other outside ship moored off port then have two mile start if be galley captain said be stealing through water at about rate of four knot perhaps may row six so will take hour to come up rather more than must say captain for wind at time freshens little be likely to be hour half before come up better peter will have learnt from picked up from boat that be not large craft that crew probably doe not exceed twenty men therefore a galley carry about twenty soldier besides twenty rower will not think necessary to keep together will do best to overtake one of be sure to be faster than others if come up singly think will be able to beat off handsomely be use discussing now whether be wise to fight not by sinking that first boat have put head in noose there be drawing back have repulsed officer with armed force there will be mercy for of if fall into hand will fight better for knowing peter said grimly dutchman be learning that a spaniard be finding to cost there be nothing like making man fight than knowledge that there be halter waiting for if be beaten have better get two of gun astern peter so a to fire down into a come up may leave others one on side for present run one of over when see side be making for ah be nice little puff if must hold like must show heel altogether in two three minute puff died out wind fell even lighter than before thought that be going to have more of captain said discontentedly looked like when sun went down think will have more before morning peter agreed be afraid wo come in time to help much a moon rose be able to make out three craft astern of two be almost abreast of other third little distance behind be just what expected peter be making race of will have two of on hand at once other will be too far away by time come up to give assistance be about mile astern now must say unless wind freshens up bit will be alongside in about twenty minute will give three men here peter a soon a have fired load again then slew gun round run forward to edge of poop point down into waist if spaniard get on board find too strong for of who can will take to forecastle others will run up here then sweep spaniard with gun directly have fired charge down among with pike axe will do same be hard if clear deck of just at moment ned hailed from top there be ship nearly ahead of sir be lying with sail brailed up evidently waiting how far be off do think ned must say be four mile away ned replied well need not trouble about for present there will be time to think about when have finished with fellow behind can come down now ned in few word captain now explained intention to men hope lad that will be able to prevent getting footing on deck if do find ca beat back a soon a give word be to take to forecastle to poop mr peter will have two gun there ready to sweep with bullet moment have fired give cheer rush down upon from side will clear off again never fear ned will be in charge in waist until rejoin get ready to run one of gun over instant tell on side be coming up depress a much a can will take one gun take other be sure fire until see boat well under muzzle of gun mind be boat be to aim at not men captain martin again ascended to poop joined peter two boat be now few hundred yard astern must hear officer cheering on rower to exert to utmost third boat be fully quarter of mile behind leader when approached within hundred yard fire of musketry be opened lie down under bulwark men captain martin said to three sailor be use risking life unnecessarily expect one boat will come one side one other peter if do will take one coming up on port side one of may miss be better to make sure of one boat if can think can make pretty sure of beating off other yes there be separating now work gun round bit so that bear on point about twenty yard astern boat length on port side will do same have done that yes think have about got sir very well then stoop down now may get hit before be time to fire bulwark round poop be only about foot high sitting back from captain mate be protected from bullet be now singing briskly over stern of ship be coming up peter captain martin said now kneel up look along gun get match ready fire till see right into boat then clap on match whether fire not boat came racing along until when within twenty yard of stern cannon be discharged almost simultaneously sound be succeeded by chorus of scream yell content of gun have struck boat fairly midships sank almost instantly a soon a have fired captain martin ran forward joined crew in waist have already passed word to ned to get gun over to starboard side at once took charge of one while ned stood at other spaniard have pushed straight on without waiting to pick up drowning comrade in other boat in minute be alongside so close did helmsman bring boat to side that gun must not be depressed so a to bear upon moment later spaniard be climbing up side of vessel rower dropping oar seizing ax joining soldier never mind gun ned be useless at present now lad drive back a come up with pike hatchet sailor met spaniard a tried to climb up cook have brought caldron of boiling water to bulwark threw pailful after pailful down into boat while carpenter bailed over boiling pitch with great ladle terrible yell scream rose from boat soldier in vain tried to gain footing upon ship deck a appeared above level of bulwark be met either with thrust of pike with crashing blow from axe be three four minute from moment that fight began that boat cast off dropped behind more than on board being killed disabled loud cheer broke from crew will run gun back to stern again peter asked from above give parting dose captain martin said let go peter be fighting to defend have done mischief enough see what third boat be doing though have stopped rowing peter said after going to stern think be picking up swimmer from boat sank there can not be many of for most of rower must have be killed by discharge soldier in armour will have sunk at once captain martin now ascended to poop in short time boat joined that have dropped astern be lying helpless in water attempt having be made to man oar a most of unwounded men be scalded more le severely report be evidently not encouraging third boat made attempt to pursue of oarsman be shifted to other boat together turned made back for amsterdam now then for vessel ahead captain martin said be much more serious business than boat vessel be two mile ahead of have now set of sail be heading towards can make out now plainly enough peter firing will of course have told be vessel that be in search of think that there be getting away from see that there be mate agreed way edged off must cut off worst of be doubt have got big gun on board little thing of ours be of good except at close quarter must be use trying to make running fight with not in least peter have better sail straight at mean to try carry by boarding peter asked doubtfully look large ship have perhaps hundred fifty men on board though spaniard be sailor can fight on deck of ship be so peter what think of doing be to bear straight down upon a if intended to board will have to stand one broadside a come up then will be past with light draught must run right away from with wind there be more of than there be be slipping away fast unless happens to knock away one of mast will get away from when be within mile of spanish ship saw bow bear off lie down lad captain ordered be going to give broadside when be over start one of sea beggar song picked up at brill will startle will think be crowded with men going to board minute later eight flash of fire burst from spanish ship now lying broadside to one shot crashed through bulwark two others passed through sail rest went wide of mark a soon a be over crew leapt to foot burst into one of wild song sung by sea beggar keep head straight towards peter captain martin said will think mean to run down will flurry confuse loading be not quick work in day distance between vessel be decreased by half before gun be again fired time be not broadside gun went off one by one a be loaded aim be hasty inaccurate for close a be not shot struck hull of good venture though two three went through sail in bright moonlight men must be seen running about officer waving arm giving order on board spaniard then head began to pay off have scared captain martin laughed thought be going to run down know sea beggar must be quite content to sink if must sink enemy follow close in wake peter then bear off little a if meant to pas on starboard side then when get close give helm sharp sweep across stern will give gun a pas then bear off again pas on port side chance be will not have loaded again there spanish ship be little more than hundred yard ahead when got before wind again captain martin saw with satisfaction that good venture sailed three foot to two poop stern gallery of spaniard be clustered with soldier who opened fire with musket upon pursuer men be lying down now at gun be loaded with musket ball to muzzle elevate a much a can be much higher out of water than be now peter see to gun will take helm will keep helm sir mate replied wo peter place be place of danger if like can lie under bulwark there after have fired be ready to take place if see drop now lad get ready so saying captain put down tiller good venture swept round under stern of spaniard at distance of forty yard a did so gun loaded with bullet to muzzle be fired one after other effect be terrible gallery poop be swept by leaden shower then captain straightened helm again crew burst into wild yell cry beggar raised when going into battle spaniard confused by terrible slaughter worked by gun of enemy believing that be about to be boarded on port side by crowd of desperate foeman hastily put up tiller ship bore away a good venture swept up presenting stern instead of broadside to to momentary relief of spaniard assailant instead of imitating maneuver kept straight upon course before wind instead of wild cry of beggar hearty english cheer be raised a captain martin have expected gun on port side have not be reloaded after last discharge good venture be two three hundred yard away before spaniard recovered from surprise at what seemed incomprehensible maneuver of foe awoke to fact that have be tricked that instead of ship crowded with beggar of sea supposed assailant have be english trader be trying to escape from dozen contradictory order be shouted a soon a truth dawned upon captain have be killed by discharge of grape first lieutenant severely wounded officer in command of troop shouted to men to load gun only to find when be accomplished that second lieutenant of ship have turned head in pursuit of enemy that not single gun must bear there be sharp altercation between two authority military chief be of highest rank see said furiously that be going away from foot be couple of hundred yard away when gave order to load now be fully quarter of mile if put helm down to bring broadside on seaman said will be mile ahead before can straighten up get in wake again unless happen to cripple will get away to certainty will get away anyhow soldier roared if cripple put helm down instantly order be given ship head swayed round there be flapping of sail rattling of block then broadside be fired be easy matter for angry excited men to hit mast at distance of nearly mile one of shot ploughed up deck within yard of foot of mainmast splintered boat three others added to hole in sail damage of importance be done by time spaniard have borne round be again in chase good venture be over mile ahead be over now captain peter said a went aft unless light upon of fellow be not likely be safe be of men hit peter carpenter be knocked down stunned by splinter from boat sir think be serious thank god for that captain said now will take helm there be something in voice startled mate be anything matter sir say be hit be hit peter fear rather badly that matter little now that crew ship be safe peter caught captain for saw that must scarce stand called two men to assistance captain be laid down on deck where be hit sir halfway between knee hip captain martin replied faintly if have be for tiller must have fallen with aid of made shift to stand on other leg be just before fired at moment when put helm down why did call peter said reproachfully be of good getting two of hit peter a long a must stand to steer be better there than ned came running aft a news be passed along that captain be wounded threw on knee by father side bear up ned bear up like man father said be hit hard know that be to death even if be be ten thousand time better to die in battle with spaniard than to be hung like dog must have befallen perhaps of if have taken by peter direction mattress be now brought up captain carried down to cabin there be thought on board now of pursuer astern of possible danger lying ahead news captain martin be badly wounded damped feeling of triumph enthusiasm crew have before be feeling at success with have eluded spaniard while heavily punishing a soon a captain be laid on sofa peter examined wound be right in front of leg four inch above knee there be nothing to be done for captain martin said have smashed bone be sure be afraid have captain peter said ruefully be use saying that have not think sir have best put in at enkhuizen be not above four five mile from now will find surgeon there who will do can for think will be best plan peter order be given at once ship course altered hour later light of enkhuizen be seen ahead chapter iv wounded dropped anchor short

enough to talk over what have best be done regarding ship business generally well have way ned at present can not think over thing see what be best so will leave matter in hand truly must be glad indeed to have mother here with well content to have obtained permission ned hurried from room have burgomaster returned asked when reached lower storey have just come in be coming up to tell that

befallen family be best that must be busied about husband so have little time to brood over matter a to hospitality must be strange indeed if must not do that must for brave man who have be injured in fighting common enemy send word to mother that will be a welcome a be that will be ready in respect to arrange may think most convenient comfortable now have best sit down have meal with a soon a be over will go down with to wharf will do what can to hasten sailing of ship think went on when have taken seat at table that there be much chance of meeting spaniard on way out to sea for have news

against port however have little fear that will do much by sea against must must hold own a well on land a can on water ned found meal extremely long tedious for be fretting to be off to hasten preparation on board good venture be delighted when at last burgomaster said now young friend will go down to wharf together although somewhat deliberate burgomaster proved valuable assistant when have told ned that must do what must to expedite sailing of ship lad have regarded a mere form of word for did not see how must in way expedite sailing a soon however a have gone on board ned have told peter that captain have given consent to sailing at once burgomaster said can scarce set sail before tide turn master peter for wind be so light that must make little progress if did from what master martin tell came off so hurriedly from amsterdam that have time to get ballast on board must be very venturesome to start for voyage to england unless with something in hold will give order that will be furnished at once with sandbag otherwise must have to wait turn with other vessel lying here for ballast be a know rare commodity in holland like parting even with sand hill in meantime a have well nigh six hour before get under way will go round among friend see if can not procure little cargo may pay of expense of voyage accordingly burgomaster proceeded at once to visit several of principal merchant representing that be clear duty of townsfolk to do what must for men who have fought so bravely against spaniard succeeded in obtaining from considerable quantity of freight upon good term so zealously did push business that in very short time dray began to arrive alongside good venture number of men be speedily at work in transferring content to hold before evening have taken on board goodly amount of cargo ned wrote letter to mother telling what have taken place saying that father must be glad for to come over to be with that left to to decide whether to bring girl over not said word of event at vordwyk merely mentioned have learned that spy have denounced father to spaniard a having used expression hostile to king religious persecution on account must have be arrested have not at once put to sea peter be charged to say nothing a to what have heard about plomaerts unless pressed with question be to report briefly that be so busy with unloading of ship at amsterdam captain martin have only once be ashore leave to be inferred that only landed to see merchant to whom cargo be consigned of course peter if mother press a to whether news have be received from vordwyk must tell truth if can be concealed from will be much best will have anxiety enough concerning father will see peter said what can be done doubtless at first will be so filled with thought of father danger that will not think much of anything else on voyage will have time to turn thought in other direction be well nigh sure to ask about father brother will be guided in answer by condition mistress martin be sensible woman not girl who will fly into hysteric rave like madwoman may be too will feel one blow le for being so taken up with other however will do best can in matter master ned truly friend burgomaster be doing right good service have looked to lose voyage to england that ten day must be away must be fairly lost time now although will not have full hold freight will be ample to pay expense to leave good profit beside a soon a tide turned hatch be put on vessel be warped out from berth few minute later be under sail ned have be busy helping to stow away cargo a fast a came on board twice running up to see how father be getting on time be told by woman whom burgomaster have now engaged to act a nurse that be sleeping quietly when returned after seeing good venture fairly under way found on peeping quietly into room captain martin have just woke have have nice sleep ned said a lad went up to bedside see be already getting dark have brig sailed have just gone out of port father wind be light be use starting until tide turned although indeed tide be of great account in inland water still have to take ballast on board a hold be empty might meet with storm on way home so have to wait for indeed after took in little ballast for burgomaster bestirred so warmly in favour that merchant sent down good a fast a must get on board short a time be main hold be well nigh half full before put on hatch so that voyage home will not be without good profit after be good news ned for although a far a be concerned money be of great consequence one way other be part owner others might well complain at sending ship home empty to fetch wife instead of attending to interest be sure must not have done that father seeing how well do for what good money venture earns why have heard say return value two year so that might well have gone without fortnight earnings without murmuring suppose must have murmured ned for be good friend of mine always seem well pleased with what do for still in matter of business be always well to be strict regular must have deemed duty to have calculated usual earnings of ship for time be away to have paid partner share a if have be trading a usual be not because ship be half mine partner make good profit out of have right to divert from trade for own purpose a say partner might be well content to let do so be not question must not be content must always in business work with good conscience being more particular about interest of who trust than of own indeed on bare ground of expediency be best to do so for then if misfortune happens trade go bad vessel be cast away will make good allowance for knowing that be loser a well a at time have thought a much of a of lay always to heart lad be unlikely that will go to sea much more ere long will be in command of good venture always think more of interest of who trust than of own have put money into ship relying upon partner skill honesty courage even at loss to yourself must show always that confidence be not misplaced do duty little more lad most men do duty be little more that make difference between one man other have tried always to do little more have found benefit from in confidence trust of partner in ship of merchant with whom do business however be right glad that ship be not going back empty will reckon how much must have received for freight be promised at amsterdam then will give account of what be to be paid by merchant here difference will make up a be only right seeing that be entirely from own imprudence in expressing opinion upon affair particular to myself in way connected with ship be forced to leave without taking in cargo ned listened in silence to father word resolved to lay to heart lesson conveyed be proud of high standing estimation in father be held by who knew now recognized fully for first time how have won that estimation be not only that be good sailor that in thing men be assured that honour must be implicitly relied upon that placed interest of employer beyond own after first day two ned must see little change in father condition be very weak low spoke seldom doubtless bodily condition be

declared for prince of orange removed to amsterdam for although prince insisted most earnestly vigorously that religious toleration must be extended to catholic that one must suffer for religion be not so tolerant when news arrived of wholesale massacre of protestant by alva troop lower class be apt to rise in riot to retaliate by destruction of property of catholic in town ned have therefore difficulty in obtaining use of house on extremely moderate term from agent in whose hand owner have placed affair in enkhuizen burgomaster wife have at request engaged two female servant nurse must of course accompany patient burgomaster wife have protested against move being made ned although thanking earnestly for hospitable offer pointed out that might be long time before father must be about be good for mother to have occupation of seeing to affair of house to divert thought from sick bed a be by mean improbable that must bring sister with must be better in respect that must have house of own doctor having be consulted agreed that must be better for wounded man to be among own people that harm must come of removing carefully to house change even slight one be often benefit agreed more than counterbalance slight risk that there may be in patient removal from one place to providing that be gently carefully managed therefore be arranged that a soon a good venture be seen approaching

everything must go on just a at home directly took charge of affair of house went up for few minute before dinner be struck with change in expression of father face there be peaceful contented look in eye almost seemed to ned that face be le hollow drawn than before ned told that must be necessary for brig to go round to leyden hague that peter have proposed that must go with to see merchant arrange business part of affair will do very well captain martin said be young ned to begin having dealing with dutch merchant when tell how come that be not able to call upon will doubtless excuse youth do wish to take cargo there father if can get captain martin did not answer for little time then said ned think have best return here in ship by time will hope be capable of thinking matter over deciding upon arrangement for future when be peter thinking of sailing by tomorrow morning tide sir said that must be ready perhaps by evening that unless wished otherwise must not start till tomorrow tide a will thereby avoid going out between island at night will be best way ned if wind be fair will be at hague before day after return ned took opportunity of speaking to mother a to wish to take service with prince of orange to aid in effort that people of netherlands be making to free from persecutor mother a feared must be case expressed strong opposition to plan be altogether too young ned even if be matter concerned doe concern mother be not dutch though be born in england subject of queen be natural must feel warmly in matter besides know that many english be already coming over here to help have not spanish killed relation unless be driven back will altogether exterminate protestant of netherlands have not already be doomed to death regardless of age sex by philip proclamation spaniard whenever capture town slay well nigh within be true enough mother agreed prof in way that be fit age to meddle in affair be sixteen mother boy of sixteen who have be year at sea be a strong a one of eighteen brought up on land have told that look two three year older than be methinks have strength to handle pike axe may be perfectly true said mr martin even supposing other thing be fitting how must spare now when father will be month before can follow trade on sea again even if be ever able to do so be thing mother weighs with know not what father wish may be in respect of course if hold that can be of use to must give up plan want at rate to mention to pray not to add objection to let decide on matter according to will there will be occasion for to add objection ned think father will listen to mad scheme for moment be not until three four day later that mr martin seeing that husband be stronger better be taking interest in what passed in house fulfilled promise to ned by telling father of wish must not be angry with said when have finished for spoke beautifully expressed a perfectly willing to yield wish to yours in matter told of course that be mad brained scheme not to be thought of still a be urgent must lay before promised to do so captain martin did not a wife expected instantly declare that plan be not to be thought of even for moment lay for time apparently turning over in mind know not quite what to say said at length not know what to say wife repeated in surprise why husband surely can not for moment think of allowing ned to embark in so wild business there be many english volunteer coming over of not much older not so fit in bodily strength for work a ned have too advantage of speaking language can pas anywhere a native be surprised sophie at thinking of for moment what must do without exclaimed in astonishment be what have be thinking a lay here have be troubled what to do with ned be too young yet to entrust with business of ship merchant here at home must hesitate in doing business with lad moreover be too young to be first mate on board brig peter be worthy man good sailor can neither read write know nought of business therefore until be able if ever will be to return to good venture must have good seaman a first mate supercargo to manage business affair of ship be ned four year older must be at once first mate supercargo there see objection that need fall to ground a to other reason will think over speak to time chapter vi prince of orange mistress martin be much troubled in mind by what seemed to unaccountable favour with husband have received ned proposal did not however allow trace of feeling to escape did mention to ned that have a yet spoken a to wish to father next day captain martin renewed subject told yesterday sophie why in opinion ned must at present be of little aid to in matter of brig may even go further in respect say that think for time will be just a well that be not on board having established position there must be special duty for to perform now have made point of telling about consignment rate of freight have encouraged always to express opinion freely on matter in order that intelligence might thereby be quickened if so expressed to supercargo latter might well take offence difficulty arise therefore before spoke to have quite resolved that must be best must sail more in good venture until old enough to come in take place of second mate supercargo must place with captain of acquaintance under whom must continue to learn duty for next three four year be good reason doubtless husband why ned must not sail in venture surely reason at why must carry out mad fancy of reason grant wife simply show that happens at moment can well spare a to main question be weighty one other young englishman have come out to fight for netherlands with far le cause than have to mix up in affair moreover principally be borne strongly upon mind that may be that boy of ours be called upon to do good service to holland seems to wife went on in answer to look of astonishment upon wife face that hand of providence be in matter have always felt with hatred of spaniard deep horror at cruelty be perpetrating upon unhappy people have thought did queen give order for war against must gladly adventure life ship in such enterprise further than have not gone upon day when news of father brother murder took solemn oath to heaven of vengeance against slayer resolved that on return to england must buy out partner in good venture with join beggar of sea wage war to death against spaniard have be willed otherwise wife within twenty four hour of taking oath be struck down fighting power be gone forever oath be not accepted be not to be instrument of god vengeance upon murderer now son without word consultation with feel called upon to take up work can not perform happens strangely that can for next two three year be well spared from life at sea that boy will do great feat suppose be cool courageous for marked demeanour under fire other day may be that though may do great thing in fighting may be mean in saving woman child from fury of spaniard if saved one next three year of life will not have be misspent may fall may be killed by spaniard mistress martin said in great agitation if be will of god wife not otherwise be exposed to danger time go to sea more than once since first came on board venture have be in dire peril who can say that next voyage may not be last however decide nothing now tomorrow will speak to boy from word whether be mere passing fancy natural enough to age to time deep longing to venture life in cause of persecuted people whose blood run in vein who have faith be own ours mr martin said more husband will have since married be in matter of importance law to be more so than ever now that lay weak helpless word manner too have much impressed whole sympathy be passionately with countryman heavy loss have so recently sustained have added vastly to hatred of spaniard suggestion too of husband that though ned might do great deed a soldier might be mean of saving woman child life appealed to womanly feeling have girl of own thought that one of like age might possibly be saved from horror of sack of city by ned assistance appealed to with great force went about house for rest of day subdued quiet ned be puzzled at demeanour have not seen for that father be progressing satisfactorily must have thought that relapse have taken place unfavourable symptom appeared be clearly not reason must only fancy now mother anxiety a to father state be in degree abating be beginning to feel loss of father brother more that request have promised to make in name to father have anything to do with matter did not enter mind indeed have begun to regret that have made not that intense longing to take service against spaniard be in way abated felt be selfish now that might for first time be of real use to parent for thus to propose to embark in adventure on own account have asked mother to put matter before father have scarce even hope latter must for moment listen to proposal next morning after breakfast a be about to start for stroll to wharf to have talk with peter mother said to quietly put aside cap ned father wish to speak to spoke so gravely that ned ascended stair in perturbation of spirit doubtless have spoken to father latter be about to rate severely for folly in proposing to desert duty to embark in so wild adventure a that have proposed be in way reassured by grave tone in father said place that chair by bedside ned sit down voice be not strong fatigue to speak loud now went on when ned with shamefaced expression have seated by bedside desire that mother tell of to fight against spaniard for time in service of prince of orange how did first come to ever since heard terrible story of persecution here ned replied said to myself then that when came to be man must take revenge for horrible murder since then more have heard of persecution that people here have suffered in cause of religion more have longed to be able to give such aid a must have spoken of over over again to sister think must ever have ventured to put desire into word have not be for terrible news learnt at vordwyk now however that have killed grandfather uncle have wounded long more than ever to join patriot here of course knowledge that many young englishman be coming out to brill flushing a volunteer added to desire said to myself if who be english be ready to give life in cause of hollander why must not who speak language be of blood have desire to do great deed to distinguish captain martin asked father have never so much a thought of must not imagine that a boy must be of great service thought might perhaps being so young be able to be of use in passing among spaniard carrying message where man must not get through thought sometimes might perhaps carry warning in time to enable woman to escape with child from town be about to be beleaguered hoped that if did stand in rank to face spaniard must not disgrace nation blood know father that be presumptuous for to think must be of real use if be against will of course a told mother submit cheerfully to wish be glad to see ned that in matter be actuated by right motif not moved by boyish idea of adventure of doing feat of valour be ordinary war boy there be none of chivalry of past time in struggle here be one of life death grim earnest determined on one side be philip with host of spain greatest power in europe determined to crush out life of poor province to stamp out religion of country to leave not one man woman child alive who refuse to attend mass to bow knee before papist image on other side have poor people tenanting land snatched from sea held by constant enduring labour equally determined that will not abjure religion that will not permit inquisition to be established among ready to give life home in cause of religious liberty have thought of throwing off allegiance to spain if spain will be tolerant prince of orange issue order proclamation a stadtholder lieutenant of king declares that be warring for philip design only to repel who by persecution cruelty be dishonouring royal cause can not go on forever in time netherlands will be driven to entreat other foreign monarch to take under protection in war there be talk of glory men be fighting for religion home wife family know that spaniard show neither quarter mercy that be scarce more than question between death by sword death by torture hanging there be mercy for prisoner town yield on good condition be sacked destroyed a be one taken by storm for in case have spaniard observed condition have made deeming oath taken to heretic to be in way binding on conscience thus ned who embark upon war engage in struggle in there be honour glory fame reward to be won one in almost certain death stare in face so far a can see can end only in annihilation of people of country in expulsion of spaniard say that there be glory to be gained be not personal glory in cause be ever more glorious than of men who struggle not to conquer territory not to gather spoil not to gratify ambition for freedom for religion for hearth home to revenge countless atrocity inflicted upon by oppressor after what have said do still wish to embark upon struggle do wish father ned said firmly desire above thing if mother can spare captain martin then repeated to ned reason that have given wife for consenting to carrying out wish fact that there be place for at present on board good venture oath of vengeance upon spaniard that have taken impression that although must not carry out that oath weight have be transferred to son whose desire to take up work have intended to carry out just at moment seemed to to be special design of providence now ned concluded understand reason sway in giving consent to desire to do what can for cause of religion liberty propose that must at present actually take up arm that question if be strong enough to wield will pray burgomaster to give letter of introduction to prince saying be young englishman ready desirous of doing lie in power for cause that speak language a native will be ready to carry message wheresoever may require to be sent that can be relied upon to be absolutely faithful have entered cause in light spirit desire for personal credit honour a one who have suffered great wrong in loss of near relative at hand of spaniard be wishful only of giving such service a can to cause may be that coming with such recommendation prince will see way in can turn service to account now leave boy be wearied with talking although deem that be not duty to withstand wish be slight trial to see only son embark in terrible perilous adventure a cause regard a sacred one seems to have right to keep from entering upon a mind lie that way ned left room greatly impressed with father word be glad indeed that permission have asked for have be granted that be free to devote to cause so dear to most englishman doubly so to from relation with country sailing backwards forward to various port in netherlands able to hold intercourse with met have for year be listening to tale of atrocity horror until have come to regard spaniard a human monster to long with heart strength to be able to join oppressed people against tyrant now have got permission to do so felt more than have done before serious nature of step be taking although did not for moment regret choice have made be conscious of importance of solemn nature of duty took upon in thus engaging in struggle between netherlands spain passed room where mother be sitting went over kissed then taking cap passed out into street mounted rampart where must think undisturbed father word have not shaken determination although have depressed enthusiasm a paced up down with fresh air from sea blowing upon cheek feeling of youth strength soon sent blood dancing through vein again cheek flushed eye brightened there be honour glory in struggle said did not people old young pour out to crusade to wrest jerusalem from hand of infidel be more glorious task be to save god follower from destruction to succour oppressed to fight for woman child a well a for men be holier nobler object than for crusader fought died in hundred of thousand

woman replied be not that landlord care what party who visit house belong to that for aught know there may be spy in own household in day be dangerous even to give shelter to one of new religion therefore although landlord may care nothing who frequent house be in way forced to do so lest must be denounced a harbourers of heretic brussels have strong party opposed to duke for know that be not of new religion only who must gladly see last of spaniard there be few heretic in brabant now inquisition council of blood have made end of most others have fled to france england holland have outwardly conformed to rite of church there be few indeed who remain openly separated from though in heart may remain heretic a before still there be great number who long to see old constitution

great number of official small garrison good many spy of be for duke rest of population must rise tomorrow did see chance of success must say that be more likely being stranger of being suspected of being spy than of being heretic be if be one ask want to know people of brussels be not given to tumult a be of antwerp ghent be quiet people going own way being capital there be more stranger resort there than to other place therefore people come go without inquiry still be must if have good reason for avoiding notice prefer to lodge outside city entering gate of morning doing what business may

have wish to get into trouble being stranger there must have difficulty in proving that story be true one be questioned next morning ned set out at daybreak arrived at brussels early in afternoon have determined to adopt advice given evening before also that must not endeavour to get lodging in of village will not take more than day at most two day to deliver letter thought to there will be hardship in sleeping in field under tree for couple of night in way will escape notice for people talk in village even more than do in town have decided that must not day endeavour to deliver of letter must content with walking about town learning name of street so that must set about delivering letter without necessity for asking many question when within mile of town left road cutting open lining of jerkin took out letter then cut up square piece of turf with knife scooped out little earth inserted packet of letter then stamped down sod above in hole close to buried money hidden in boot then returning to road walked on into brussels feeling much more comfortable now that have for time got rid of document must cost life be found upon passing through gate wandered about for hour through street interested in stir bustle prevailed mingled with grave citizen be spanish german soldier noble with train of page follower deputy from other town of brabant artois monk priest country people who have brought in produce councillor statesman spanish noble whining mendicant learnt name of many of street marked house of for whom have letter of be noble others citizen of brussels bought bread cheese in marketplace ate sitting on doorstep having tied food in bundle to serve for supper left town well satisfied with discovery slept under shelter of haystack in morning dug up packet

closed door behind now asked what message do bring from holland bring letter ned replied taking out knife again cut thread of lining produced packet silk bound be fastened by prince seal be so arranged that must be slipped off so enable packet to be opened without breaking seal ned took out letter after examining mark on corner handed one to burgher latter opened read content be told said when have finished not to give answer in writing to deliver by word of mouth tell prince have sounded many of guild that certainly greater part of weaver will rise join in expelling spaniard whenever general rising have be determined upon be certain that other chief town will join in movement unless be general fear that nothing can be done so great be consternation have be caused by sack of mechlin slaughter of thousand of citizen horrible atrocity upon woman that city alone will dare to provoke vengeance of alva must rise none will do so be convinced that brussels will do part if others do theirs although a capital be upon first brunt of spanish attack will fall in regard to money tell at present none can be collected in first place be well nigh ruined by exaction of spanish in next however well disposed may be there be few who must commit by subscribing for cause until revolt be general successful then doubt not that councillor must vote a large subsidy a city must afford to pay four at least of member of council of guild can be thoroughly relied upon prince can safely communicate with be gunther barneveldt hasselaer buy please repeat again ned said in order may be sure to remember rightly a to general toleration burgher went on after repeating name in matter of religion although there be many difference of opinion think that prince command on head will be complied with that must be agreed that lutheran calvinist other sect will be allowed to assemble for worship without hindrance catholic feeling be very strong especially among noble number of secretly inclined to new religion have decreased greatly in past few year just a have increased in holland zeeland where a hear people be now well nigh protestant please assure prince of devotion to personally that will do best to further plan can promise that guild of weaver will be among first to rise against tyranny of spaniard ned a left house decided that man have visited be not one of who must be of great use in emergency be evidently well enough disposed to cause be not one to take great risk to join openly in movement unless convinced that success be assured for be walking along thinking matter over when be suddenly roughly accosted looking up saw councillor von aert clerk former with angry look on face latter who be close beside master who have evidently drawn attention to with malicious grin of satisfaction hullo sirrah councillor said angrily did not tell to call upon at antwerp ned took off hat said humbly must of course have obeyed worship order have passed through antwerp afterwards remembered that have cause to pas through ghent therefore took that road knowing well that one so insignificant a myself must have nothing to tell worship must occupy valuable time that will see about councillor said grimly genet lay hand upon young fellow collar will lodge in safe keeping inquire into matter when have leisure doubt not that be right when told that suspected be other than seemed ned glanced round group of spanish soldier be standing close by saw that attempt at escape must be hopeless therefore walked quietly along by side of clerk horse determining to wrest from man hold run for instant saw opportunity unfortunately however be unaware that be at moment within fifty yard of prison several bystander who have heard conversation followed to see result other passersby seeing ned led by collar behind dreaded councillor speedily gathered around with look expressing goodwill to von aert spanish soldier however accustomed to fray with townspeople at once drew weapon closed round clerk captive two minute later arrived at door of prison ned completely taken by surprise found thrust in door closed behind before have time to decide upon best course will place prisoner in secure place councillor said be case of grave suspicion will myself question later on keep eye upon until come again ned be handed over to two warder who conducted to chamber in third storey here to dismay one of jailer took up post while other retired locking door behind thus intention ned have formed a ascended stair of destroying document a soon a be alone be frustrated warder took place at window looked into inner court of prison putting head out entered into conversation with of comrade in yard below ned regretted now that have before leaving burgher again sewn up letter in doublet have carried loosely about must have chewed up one by one swallowed dared not attempt to get at now a warder might at moment look round latter be relieved twice during course of day none of men paid attention to prisoner succession of victim who entered wall of prison only to quit for gallows be so rapid that have time to concern with affair probably boy be heretic whether not if have incurred enmity of councillor von aert doom be sealed be late in evening before warder appeared at door said that councillor be below that prisoner be to be brought before ned be led by two men to chamber on ground floor here von aert with two of colleague be seated at table former clerk standing behind be prisoner made morning von aert said to companion overtook two mile side of axel questioned admitted that came from holland answer be so unsatisfactory that ordered strictly to call upon at antwerp not having time at moment to question further instead of obeying struck off from road took that through ghent must have heard more of have not by chance encountered morning in street here have be searched asked warder excellency gave order that must be examined fool councillor said angrily be way do duty have be bearer of important correspondence might have destroyed by now have not left excellency have never be alone for moment have opportunity whatever for destroying anything well search that bundle first councillor said bundle be found to contain nothing suspicious now take off doublet boot examine carefully let not seam corner escape accustomed to work one of warder have scarcely taken doublet in hand when proclaimed that there be parcel sewn up in lining thought so von aert exclaimed beaming with satisfaction at own perspicacity thought there be something suspicious about fellow believe can almost smell out heretic traitor councillor colleague murmured admiration at acuteness what have here von aert went on a examined packet sealed parcel addressed 'to blue cap in south corner of market square of brussels what think of friend for mystery treason now let see content ah ten letter without address see there be mark different from other on corner ah went on with growing excitement a tore one open glanced at content from arch traitor to conspirator here in brussels be important capture indeed now sirrah what have to say to for whom be letter intended know nothing of content of letter worshipful sir ned said falling on knee assuming appearance of abject terror be delivered to at haarlem be told that must have five noble if carried to brussels delivered safely to man who must meet in south corner of market square of brussels be to hold packet in hand sling bundle upon stick so that might know be to have blue cap on be to touch on shoulder ask blow wind in holland that worshipful sir be know about must not tell that there be treason in business else not for fifty noble must have undertaken lie young villain councillor shouted do try to persuade that prince of orange must have intrusted document of such importance to first boy met in street in first place must be heretic know about heretic ned said rising to foot speaking stubbornly be of religion father taught must not pretend be catholic not to save life there be see councillor said triumphantly to colleague look at obstinacy insolence of hollander even brat of boy dare to tell that be not catholic take away said to warder see that be securely kept may want to question again in case will go to gallows tomorrow next day ned be at once led away what think von aert asked colleague a door closed behind prisoner be worth while to apply torture to at once to obtain from name of for whom letter be intended be most important for to know look at letter be from prince refers to preparation making for general rising must hardly think boy must have be intrusted with so important secret one of other councillor said for must be well known must be forced by torture to reveal if letter be to be found upon think that story tell be true one that be more likely must be given to deliver to person who must posse key to mark on letter well at rate harm can be done by applying screw councillor said if know will make speak warrant other two agreed if will allow to suggest excellency genet said humbly that might be better way to try first if such a blue cap exists boy might be promised life if must prove that story be true doubtless there be fixed hour at be to meet blue cap might let go to meet keeping of course strict watch over then if such man appears speaks to must pounce upon at once wring from key to mark if such man appears must then know that story be device to deceive must then obtain by mean truth from suggestion met with approval be very good plan will be carried out send for prisoner again ned be brought down again see that be young von aert said have doubtless be misled in matter knew not that be carrying treasonable correspondence therefore be disposed to treat leniently at what time be to meet blue cap in market within hour of sunset ned replied be to be there at sunset to wait for hour be told that must not fail to come in time that if did be to come again next day be to be hoped that will not fail von aert said grimly for will not be disposed to wait pleasure tomorrow evening will go with packet deliver to man when come to beware that try to trick for will be closely watched will be worse for if attempt treachery if man come who be there will know how to deal with will be at liberty to depart ned asked doubtfully of course will von aert replied must then have further occasion for must have proved to that story be true one that be really in ignorance that there be harm in carrying packet hither ned be perfectly well aware that councillor be lying that even have met man in blue cap must be dragged back to prison put to death that promise meant absolutely nothing spaniard having hesitation in breaking most solemn oath made to heretic have indeed only asked question because thought that to assent too willingly to proposal might arouse suspicion be very thing have be hoping for offered sole prospect of escape from death by torture for must at least give chance of dash for freedom have named hour after sunset partly because be hour must have be probably chosen by who wished that meeting must take place unobserved still more because chance of escape must be vastly greater be attempt made after dark three councillor sat for time talking over matter after ned have be removed letter have be read have be carefully written so a to give information if must fall into wrong hand none of contained allusion to past letter previous negotiation be clear von aert said that be conspiracy that to whom letter be sent be deeply concerned in yet letter prove suppose that seize blue cap get from boy name of for whom letter be intended must swear on other hand that knew nothing whatever about have be falsely accused doubt many of people be noble citizen of good position if be merely word against word of boy that wrung from by torture case must not be strong one case be not always strong one of other councillor said that doe not often make much difference make none with lower class of people von aert agreed when have to deal with people who have influential friend be always best to be able to prove case completely think that if get name of for whom letter be meant can utilize boy again will send to deliver letter in person a believe be intended to do may receive answer to take back to holland even if doe not fact that people must have received such letter without at once denouncing bearer communicating content to will be quite sufficient proof of guilt in case one of others remarked boy must not be crippled with torture there will be occasion for von aert said contemptuously couple of turn with thumbscrew will suffice to get out of boy of age everything know well friend will meet here tomorrow evening will go round to market square with genet to see result of affair in own be deeply interested not only because be most important because be due to fact that entertained suspicion of boy that discovery of plot have be made will take charge of letter be for time useless to be likely to bring ten men head to block a ned sat alone in cell during long hour of following day longed for time to come when fate be to be settled be determined that if lay with must not be captured alive must mount to top story of house throw out of window snatch dagger from one of guard stab if saw mode of escape thousand time better to die so than to expire on gibbet after suffering atrocious torture must knew wring from name of for whom letter be intended must bear pain a well a flesh blood must not resist terrible agony inflicted by torture sooner later truth must be wrung from most reluctant lip still thought that have fair chance of escape be clear that must not be closely surrounded by guard for in case blue cap must not venture near must therefore be allowed considerable amount of liberty however many men might be on watch short distance off ought to be able by sudden rush to make way through there must at hour be number of people in street must add to chance of evading pursuer ate heartily of meal be brought at midday when just at sunset warder entered cell told to follow felt equal to exertion when came down into courtyard dozen men be gathered there together with von aert clerk now councillor said sternly see men will be round on side warn that if attempt to escape to give warning sign to blue cap to try trick with of sort will be put to death with such torture a never dreamt of upon other hand if carry out order faithfully hand over packet to man who meet will be at liberty to go straight away to return home without molestation understand ned replied a can not help will do bidding where be stick bundle will not know unless have be to carry on shoulder ah forgot councillor said giving order to one of warder ned bundle stick be brought will stroll leisurely along von aert said appear natural unconcerned will be close to will be seized in instant if observe anything suspicious in movement von aert then took packet from doublet handed to ned who placed in belt prison door be opened three four of men went out ned followed be curious feeling to a walked down street round be number of people laughing chatting a went while though apparently a free a be prisoner with dozen pair of eye watching life in deadly peril chapter ix in hiding after five minute walking ned arrived at market square passed steadily down towards south corner market be long since over market folk have returned to farm village there be large number of people walking about be already growing dusk in half hour must be dark ned turned when got near corner strolled short distance back then turned again carefully abstained from seeming to stare about councillor clerk kept within short distance of former wrapped up in cloak with high collar that almost concealed face a to others watching ned must only guess at four men noticed who turned whenever did others guessed be keeping somewhat further off be perhaps stationed at street leading out of square so a to cut off must escape from close to few oil lamp be suspended from post at various point in square at end of street leading from be lighted soon after arrived in square decided that must not do to make for street leading out of south corner a be one that must be suspected of aiming for moreover men must surely be placed there to cut off blue cap on entry therefore determined to make for somewhat narrow street about halfway between south west corner have followed on day entered brussels a one of person to whom letter be addressed lived in knew that there be many lane running into at lower end several street branching off in various direction met in small square in terminated hour passed be now quite dark felt that have better delay no longer walked half along beat towards south corner then with sudden spring darted off two men walking on side of be ten pace distant ran straight at taken by surprise before have time to throw back cloak draw rapier be upon with blow from leaded stick delivered with strength struck one man to ground then turning to other struck on wrist a be in act of drawing sword man uttered loud cry of pain rage ned ran at top of speed towards street knew that need fear pursuit from two men have encountered that on other side of be distance behind that a so many people intervened pursuer must probably soon lose sight of threading way between group of people who have arrested walk at sound of loud sudden shouting approached end of street by light of lamp there saw two men standing with drawn sword breaking suddenly into walk made for house next to street then turned so that came upon men sideways instead of from front at be expecting there be sudden exclamation from man nearest to ned be within two yard of before perceived before be on guard loaded stick fell with full sweep of ned arm upon ankle in instant be prostrate ned darted at full speed down street with other man in pursuit few pace behind before have run far ned found that must gain little upon pursuer that must rid of if be to have chance of escaping slackened speed little allowed man to gain slightly upon

in most of boat here must be starving will do capitally ned said anyhow will be amusement to boat be pulled up alongside ned four of men got into rowed down port into old haven out between two fort guarding entrance into scheldt then dropping grapnel baited line began to fish a boat from other craft lying by shore be engaged in same work either with line net be natural enough did not return until evening be falling by time have captured considerable number of fish have have more luck than have have week one of men said a rowed back sometimes have only got just enough for ourselves today when want have caught enough to sell for two three guilder for fish be scarce now in town fetch good price however will come in handy for voyage when came alongside skipper told that three hour before two of city constable have come along have inquired of whether have seen aught of tall man of thirty year of age dressed in sober clothes with appearance of retainer in good family have assured have seen none at answering that description indeed that one beside crew have be on wharf day have nevertheless come on board searched cabin finding nothing suspicious hearing that rest of crew four men boy be engaged in fishing have gone off without further question where do guard boat ply ned asked presently mile two above fort a much below for see vessel can come up passage from sea be longest round by walcheren far easier freer from sandbank vessel from west generally take walcheren passage from east coaster who know foot of river come by eastern scheldt way do think of going that by flushing if have choice pas several town in possession of spaniard be beggar to come up must probably take other channel have noticed that there be always two rowboat in river to east only one to west greatest difficulty will be in passing two warship anchored at mouth of port under gun of fort once fairly out into scheldt may think safe for river be so wide that unless by grievous ill chance be not likely to be seen on dark night such a will be by rowboat real danger be in getting through two fort ship at mouth of port there be vigilant watch kept at fort there be not likely to be sentry placed on wall at entrance of inner haven on running along by old haven down to fort will start a soon a tide turn drift down with will get out pole two to keep course down centre till get near fort must then let drift a will for splash in water slightest sound must call attention of sentry there if alarm be given boat of two ship outside must have to certainty think night be going to be most favourable cloud be low have felt speck two of mist will come on faster presently will want keen eye to see five yard away when night fall luckily there be not breath of wind at present hope there will not be until be fairly out otherwise must be sure to drift ashore on one side other a go down channel chapter xii back with prince before throwing off warp from shore captain gave man order two be to stand with fender in case boat drifted against craft against wall two be to take long pole used for punting old sail have be torn up into strip wrapped round with pad of old rope at end so that must push off from wall without noise not word be to be spoken in case of being hailed be there to be slightest movement on board unless use of fender pole be required lastly took off boot be hour after turn of tide when warp be thrown off tide in inner port be so sluggish that be absolutely necessary to pole boat along until got out into what be known a old haven be cut leading down from town to river work be noiselessly done ned standing at bow beside skipper scarce heard slightest sound night be fortunately very dark looking intently must hardly make out outline of shore on side in quarter of hour emerged from inner port on left hand wall of fortification connecting town with north fort at mouth of haven rose high above outline must be seen against sky captain have told men poling to take sharp round corner keep along a close a possible to foot of wall a be far le likely to be observed by sentry who might be there than must be if kept out in centre of cut very slowly boat drifted along course assisted occasionally by men pushing with pole against foot of wall rose few foot from while with fender stood in readiness to place in position must ship approach so close to wall a to render contact probable captain be now at tiller way given by pole being sufficient to enable to keep on course close to wall quarter of hour be at end of wall for fort at entrance be detached be now approaching most dangerous portion of passage be no longer sheltered in shadow must go along openly be however improbable that there must be sentry on face of fort looking towards town ned accustomed a be to keep watch on deck at night must scarce make out low shore few yard away felt pretty confident that eye of sleepy sentry must not be able to pierce gloom men have ceased poling now only giving occasional push to keep head straight prevent from swinging round presently sailor standing next to ned touched arm pointed to right straining eye must dimly make out dark mass looming in direction unlike wall have left fort stood at little distance back from water ned be sure that a must scarce make out outline of one nearest to one upon wall must distinguish tracery of mast rigging of boat mist have thickened since have started coming on heavier just at point fort be presently entirely obscured twenty minute passed must be now ned knew in course of river began to think that danger be over when dark object suddenly appeared from mist close at hand in moment there be shock then long grinding motion a boat swept along by side of large ship following shock came sharp challenge from darkness above followed by other shout obedient to order have received no sound be heard from smack man stooped low under bulwark two three shot rang out from ship there be hail in dutch stop will sink ned knew that be idle threat vessel be lying head to tide only small gun two in stern must be brought to bear already ship be lost to sight in mist there be much shouting noise heard astern then creaking of block ned made way aft game be up skipper said will be alongside in few minute dark a be can not miss will know that must have drifted straight down must take to boat row for must say captain ned said have best take to boat row off for short distance then wait a likely a not may think when board that have simply drifted out from town having be carelessly moored in case may let drop anchor return to ship be happy thought captain said running forward told crew to take boat at once have idea captain ned said just a be about to push off a saw when be passing ship be drifting stern foremost if can fasten long line to stern can hang on to will not be able to see if be twenty fathom astern then if anchor a be likely enough leave two three men on board can haul noiselessly up with rope board capital captain replied be wondering how must find again in dark must be very thing sprang on board again fastened light line to rudder dropped down into boat again now back astern lad very gently can hear oar in minute captain gave order to cease rowing for line have tightened spanish ship be showing bright light in stern acted a guide to boat in two three minute after crew have left smack two large boat full of soldier came alongside in little boat lying fifty sixty yard away must hear word be spoken first came volley of angry exclamation of disappointment a spaniard found that have be called from bed only to capture empty little coaster a ned have expected speedily came to conclusion that having be carelessly fastened up alongside wharf without one being left in charge have drifted out with tide must serve right if be to set alight one of officer said have best not to do replied might cause alarm in town besides boat be wanted have better drop anchor leave four men on board to take care of in morning knave to whom belongs will come out to claim warrant captain will punish sharply for trouble have given opinion prevailed minute latter splash be heard in water in very short time line connecting boat with smack tightened on board knew that have be brought up by anchor there be good deal of noise trampling of foot a spaniard took place in boat again then heavy splashing of many oar a started to row back against tide to own vessel captain wrung ned hand have saved boat for young sir for must never have found again if have on board must have heard rowing up to must have given alarm now have only to wait for bit then haul up overpower spaniard doubt if must do without noise ned replied at rate must be very dangerous while ship be lying so close must say best plan will be to wait a say till spaniard have settled comfortably then to haul up to push boat along by side fending off carefully so a to make noise until reach bow then can cut cable let drift tide be running strong now in hour will be over mile down river there will be fear of shout being heard on board ship can then board tackle spaniard will certainly be best way captain agreed nothing must be better well will give hour to settle in cabin will not stay on deck many minute in wet sound of voice on board smack soon ceased after waiting hour to give spaniard time if not to go to sleep to become drowsy captain one of men began to pull upon line presently dark mass must be seen ahead be soon up to very carefully passed boat alongside taking pain to prevent touching when reached bow captain grasped cable with two three cut with knife severed then boat be pushed off from ship gently paddled away to full length of line half hour again drew alongside noiselessly climbed on to deck men armed with belaying pin ned took pistol from belt beneath jacket then quietly approached door there be light burning within cabin be astern built upon deck be used by skipper by passenger might be carrying crew living in forecastle door opened outwards be noiselessly closed for two of spaniard be sitting up playing card there be chance of taking party so much by surprise a to capture without noise instant door be closed heavy coil of rope be thrown against there be loud exclamation in cabin moment later rush to door however did not yield then window in side be thrown open head be thrust out there be loud shout of treachery help moment later heavy belaying pin fell on head disappeared then there be loud explosion a arquebus be fired bullet crashing through door be good thing be well on way skipper said must be two mile from spanish ship now even if hear report will not think have anything to do with besides if did must never find more rope have now be piled against door there be fear of being burst open two men be posted at window on side of cabin with sword for weapon have now be fetched from forecastle now captain said let get up sail there be little wind think there be enough to give steerage way prevent from drifting on to sandbank suppose be well beyond guard boat now captain ned asked oh yes be not more than mile below fort besides must think have not be out for must know that when tide once turned craft must come up from below yes be quite safe a far a be concerned sail be soon made though there be scarce wind enough to belly out canvas boat began to move slowly through water a be shown by answering helm discharge of arquebus in cabin be continued from time to time may a well cease noise captain shouted to ship be mile away unless want throat cut have better keep yourselves quiet know beggar be not to be trifled with soldier ceased firing have indeed already concluded from fact that boat did not come to rescue that vessel must somehow have got far from ship name of terrible beggar filled with alarm for knew that showed mercy have not least idea a to number of captor gave up for lost hour later captain dropped second anchor brought up in stream must wait till morning said be use getting away from spaniard to be cast ashore there be saying in what part of river may be at present though must certainly be six seven mile below bergen towards morning mist cleared off wind began to freshen think will blow hard before long captain said a be from southwest will soon carry out of river now what have better do with fellow in cabin must say best plan captain must be to bring boat alongside tell that if will leave arm behind come out one by one may take to row ashore that if refuse will open door give quarter must be best plan captain agreed going to one of window offered term to spaniard men have prepared for worst have determined to sell life a dearly a possible so convinced be that beggar must show quarter that be at first incredulous be trick to get to give up arm one said be not captain replied swear to on word of sailor that will respect term allow to depart unarmed want to throw away three four life merely for pleasure of cutting throat after consultation between soldier accepted term ned placed at one of window to see that arm be laid aside before men issued out then coil of rope be removed door opened sailor taking place there in case spaniard at last moment must catch up arm however have idea of doing be indeed far more afraid of treachery than be captor one by one issued out passed between line of sailor to bulwark got into boat be still dark must not tell that group of men at cabin door be on board a soon a last be in rope be thrown off boat dropped astern will be light enough to see shore in hour captain said a drifted away then can land where like must be awkward if happen to light upon town ned said so bring out boat to cut off there be fear of that captain replied tergoes be only place down here in have garrison that lie mile away yet besides will get under way a soon a can make out shore have only two oar on board be not likely to know very much about rowing besides will make out shore from deck before will from boat of course will not go round by flushing now will be shorter for to go straight out to sea through island yes le dangerous there may be ship at tergoes on east side of walcheren a still hold middleburg sooner be out to sea better will of course suit also ned replied only wanted to put ashore at flushing in order to take boat there for rotterdam so that will save one day if not two if sail direct in half hour be light enough to make out shore anchor be again weighed in boat got under way be now off end of island of st anna leaving south beveland behind turned up channel called kype between island of north beveland duveland here passed many fishing smack coasting vessel for be now in heart of zeeland far beyond reach of spaniard be frequently hailed be greeted with shout of applause when told how have given spaniard slip made escape from bergen two hour later be out at sea before sunset entered port of rotterdam finding when landed that prince of orange have day returned from trip to haarlem other town where have be engaged in raising spirit of citizen inciting to resistance urging that be necessary to make common effort against

child in sacking of church of own religion don frederick anticipated quick easy success deemed that weakly fortified town might well be captured in week by army of men that after spending few day slaughtering inhabitant pillaging burning house army must march on against next town until ere long rebellion must be stamped out holland transformed into desert at end of three day cannonade breach in spite of effort of besieged be practicable strong storming party led by general romero advanced against a column be seen approaching church bell rang out alarm citizen caught up arm men woman hurried to threatened point a approached spaniard be received with heavy fire of musketry with usual gallantry veteran of spain pressed forward began to mount breach now be exposed not only to fire of garrison to missile thrown by burgher woman heavy stone boiling oil live coal be hurled down upon small hoop smeared with pitch set on fire be dexterously thrown over head after vain struggle in many officer be killed wounded romero who have lost eye in fight called off troop fell back from breach leaving from three to four hundred dead behind while half dozen of townsman lost life upon retreat of spaniard delight in city be immense have met pikemen of spain hurled back discomfited felt that must now trust to meet further assault without flinching to ned surprise aunt when alarm bell rung have sallied out from house accompanied by two girl carried with dozen ball of flax size of head have be soaked in oil turpentine to stout cord about two foot long be attached girl have taken part in work of preceding day when reached breach told to remain in shelter while joined crowd on wall flanking breach while ned took part in front row of defender frau plomaert be slow be strong when chose to exert when conflict be at thickest lighted ball at fire over caldron of oil be seething whirling round head sent one by one into midst of spanish column three of hit men fairly in face said to one of neighbour so think have done share of today work then calmly descended wall joined daughter returned home paying attention to din of conflict at breach contended that have done must be expected of on reaching home bade girl take to knitting a usual while set to work to prepare midday meal few day later prince of orange sent from sassenheim place on southern extremity of lake where have now taken up headquarters force of men with seven gun convoy of wagon with ammunition food towards town under general batenburgh officer have replaced de la marck whose brutal ferocious conduct have long disgraced dutch cause whom prince finding that be deaf alike to order to dictate of humanity have now deprived of commission batenburgh expedition be more fortunate than of de la marck have be on approach to city by night thick mist set in column completely lost way citizen have received news of coming church bell be rung cannon fired to guide a to direction column be so helplessly lost that at last wandered in among spaniard who fell upon slew many scattered rest very few only succeeding in entering town batenburgh brought off under cover of mist remnant of troop provision ammunition be lost second in command de koning be among captured spaniard cut off head threw over wall into city with paper fastened on bearing word be head of captain de koning who be on way with reinforcement for good city of haarlem people of haarlem be now strung up by own peril knowledge of atrocity committed by spaniard in other city to point of hatred fury equal to of foe retorted by chopping off head of eleven prisoner throwing into spanish camp there be label on barrel with word deliver head to duke alva in payment of ten penny tax with one additional head for interest besieged be not content to remain shut up in wall frequently sallied out engaged in skirmish with enemy prisoner be therefore often captured by one side other gibbet on wall in camp be constantly occupied ned a volunteer be not attached to special body of troop ripperda telling to act for join in be going on a chose consequently took part in many of skirmish outside wall be surprised to find how fearlessly burgher met tried soldier of spain especially at valour with corp of woman battled with enemy in strength stature most of woman be fully match for walloon troop indeed for majority of spaniard never feared to engage body of troop of equal numerical strength look here aunt ned said to frau plomaert upon day after failure of batenburg force to relieve town must see for now that chance be that sooner later town will be captured may beat off assault of spaniard will ere long have to fight with even more formidable foe within town know that stock of provision be small that in end unless help come must yield to famine prince may possibly throw five thousand armed men into town be absolutely impossible that can throw in great store of provision unless entirely defeat spaniard nowhere in holland can raise army sufficient for think aunt while there be time ought to set to work to construct hiding place where girl can remain while sack atrocity will assuredly follow surrender of town be taking place will certainly not hide from spaniard frau plomaert said stoutly very well aunt if choose to be killed on own hearthstone of course can not prevent do say that ought to save girl from horror if can that be ready to do said how be to be managed well aunt there be wood cellar below can surely construct place of concealment there of course will do work though girl might help by bringing up basket of earth scattering in street having received tacit permission from aunt ned went down into wood cellar be five foot wide by eight foot long like place about dutch house be whitewashed be half full of wood ned climbed over wood to further end be where must be said to girl who have followed now first thing to do be to pile wood so a to leave passage by can pas along will get pick get out brick at corner need only make hole foot wide need not be more than foot high lucette elder said will be sufficient for to squeeze through must lucette will want more space for working so to begin with will take away brick up to top can close up a much a like afterwards there be plenty of time for will be week before city be starved out if work for hour day can get done in week accordingly work began brick be removed with pick shovel ned dug into ground beyond while girl carried away earth scattered in road in fortnight chamber five foot high three foot wide six foot long have be excavated slat of wood supported by prop along side held up roof quantity of straw be thrown in for girl to lie on frau plomaert came down from time to time to inspect progress of work expressed well pleased with how be going to close entrance ned asked propose to brick up again three foot high aunt then when girl have gone in for hope that will change mind at last will brick up rest of using mud instead of mortar so that brick can be easily removed when time come one two can be taken out to pas in food then replaced a before after be in will whitewash whole cellar one must then guess wall have ever be disturbed will leave two brick out in bottom row of to give air will be covered over by wood however hard up get for fuel can leave enough to cover floor at end few inch deep if can will pierce hole up under board in room above so a to give free passage of air if spaniard take away wood a may well do will notice that two brick be gone mr plomaert objected can provide for aunt by leaving two brick inside whitewashed like rest to push into hole if hear anyone removing wood there be only light come in at door must never be noticed that two brick be loose will do very well mr plomaert said thought at first that idea be foolish see that will save girl if place be taken suppose there will be plenty of time to brick up after have taken refuge in plenty of time aunt will know day before if city surrender to hunger will certainly fight much more comfortably now that know come lucette annie be safe from horror of sack chapter xiv fall of haarlem after terrible repulse inflicted upon storming party don frederick perceived that task before be not to be accomplished with ease rapidity have anticipated that hitherto despised dutch heretic have at last be driven by despair to fight with desperate determination be altogether new to spaniard therefore abandoned idea of carrying place by assault determined to take by slower surer process of regular siege in week pioneer must be able to drive mine beneath wall explosion must then open way for troop accordingly work began besieged sooner perceived what be being done than thousand men who have devoted to work at once began to drive counter mine party worked with energy be not long before gallery met desperate struggle commenced under ground here drill discipline of spaniard availed little be conflict of man to man in narrow passage with such light only a few torch must give here strength fearlessness of death of sturdy dutch burgher fisherman more than compensated for superiority of spaniard in management of weapon air be so heavy thick with powder that torch gave feeble light combatant be well nigh stifled by fume of sulphur yet in gallery met men fought night day without intermission place of who retired exhausted fell dead be filled by others impatiently waiting turn to take part in struggle while fighting continued work went on also fresh gallery be continually being driven on side occasionally tremendous explosion took place a one party other sprung mine shock sometimes bringing down earth in passage far removed from explosion burying combatant beneath while yawning pit be formed where explosion took place fragment of body cast high in air many of gallery be so narrow low that arm save dagger must be used men fought like wild beast grappling rolling on ground while comrade with lantern torch stood behind waiting to spring upon other a soon a struggle terminated one way other for fortnight underground struggle continued then don frederick finding that ground be gained that loss be so great that even bravest soldier be beginning to dread turn to enter upon conflict in military training went for nothing where so many hundred of comrade have perished abandoned hope of springing mine under wall drew off troop month have already elapsed since repulse of attack on breach while fight have be going on underground steady fire have be kept up against work called ravelin protecting gate of cross during time letter have from time to time be brought into town by carrier pigeon prince urging citizen to persevere holding out hope of relief promise be to extent fulfilled on th of january when veteran soldier bringing with sledge laden with powder bread crossed frozen lake succeeded in making way into city time be now at hand when besieged foresaw that ravelin of cross gate must not much longer be defended have be making preparation for contingency through long night of january noncombatant old men woman child aided by such of fighting men a be not worn out by work on wall underground laboured to construct wall in form of half moon on inside of threatened point none who be able to work be exempt none wished to be exempted for heroic spirit burned brightly in heart in haarlem nightly ned went down with aunt cousin worked side by side with house near new work be levelled in order that material must be utilized for construction of wall be built of solid masonry small stone be carried by child younger girl in basket heavier one dragged on hand sledge by men woman although constitutionally adverse to exertion frau plomaert worked sturdily ned be often surprised at strength for dragged along without difficulty loaded sledge be unable to move throwing weight on to rope passed over shoulder toiling backwards forward to from wall for hour slowly unflinchingly seemed to ned under exertion visibly decreased in weight from day to day indeed scanty supply of food upon work have to be done be ill calculated to support strength of engaged upon such fatiguing labour for from commencement of siege whole population have be rationed provision in town have be handed over to authority for equal division house rich poor have be rigorously searched to see that none be holding back supply for private consumption many of cattle horse have be killed salted down daily distribution of food be made to household according to number of mouth contained furious at successful manner in party have entered town on th of january don frederick kept up for next few day terrible cannonade against gate of cross of st john wall connecting at end of time wall be greatly shattered part of st john gate be in ruin assault be ordered to take place at midnight so certain be of success that don frederick ordered whole of force to be under arm opposite gate of city to prevent population making escape chosen body of troop be to lead assault at midnight advanced silently against breach besieged have suspicion that attack be intended there be forty men posted rather a sentry than guard at breach however when spaniard advanced gave alarm watcher in church sounded tocsin sleeping citizen sprang from bed seized arm ran towards threatened point unawed by overwhelming force advancing against sentry took place at top of breach defended with such desperation that kept assailant at bay until assistance arrived when struggle assumed more equal character citizen defended by same mean have before proved successful boiling oil pitch stone flaming hoop torch missile of kind be hurled down by upon spaniard while garrison defended breach with sword pike until daylight struggle continued philip then ordered whole of force to advance to assistance of storming party tremendous attack be made upon ravelin in front of gate of cross be successful spaniard rushed exulting into work believing that city be now at mercy then to astonishment saw that be confronted by new wall whose existence have not even suspected while be hesitating tremendous explosion took place citizen have undermined ravelin placed store of powder there be now fired work flew into air with soldier who have entered retreat be sounded at once spaniard fell back to camp thus second time burgher of haarlem repulsed assault by overwhelming force under best general of spain effect of failure be so great that don frederick resolved not to risk defeat to abandon effort to capture city by

so to sally out either win way through camp die together news of resolve reached ear of don frederick knew now what burgher of haarlem be capable of thought that must probably fire city before left thus leaving nothing heap of ash a trophy of victory therefore sent letter to magistrate in name of count overstein commander of german force in besieging army giving solemn assurance that if surrendered at discretion punishment must be inflicted except upon who in judgment of citizen have deserved at moment of sending letter don frederick be in possession of strict order from father not to leave man alive of garrison with exception of german to execute large number of burgher on receipt of letter city formally surrendered on th of july great bell be tolled order be issued that arm

sight there be plenty in bag to last girl for week must eat sparingly girl not because there be not enough food because after fasting so long be necessary for at first to take food in very small quantity bread taken out be soaked swelled so much in water that made much more than have expected therefore divided in half portion made excellent meal for ned aunt remaining being carefully put by for following day hour two after eating meal frau plomaert felt so much stronger that be able to obey order to go up to cathedral ned went with able bodied men to cloister spaniard soon came among dragged off number of whom thought most likely to have taken prominent part in fighting to execution a did not wish others from whom money must be wrung to escape from hand presently issued food to remainder woman after remaining for hour in cathedral be suffered to depart to home for starving condition excited compassion even of spaniard atrocity have taken place at sack of mechlin zutphen naarden be not repeated in haarlem next day men be also released not from idea of mercy in order that when returned to home work of picking out better class for execution must be more easily carried on for three day longer girl remained in hiding be then allowed to come out a ned felt now that danger of general massacre be averted now ned aunt said must stay here no longer day hear proclamation read in street that sheltering refugee others not belonging to town will be punished with death a know stranger caught have be murdered have heard from of neighbour ned have not stirred out since returned from cloister for aunt have implored not to do so a must only be running useless risk hear went on that have searched many house for fugitive be probable hunt may become even more strict therefore think ned that for sake a well a own have better try to escape quite agree with aunt now that worst be over know that girl be safe good purpose must be served by staying being stranger one who have fought here must certainly be killed if laid hand on a to escaping think there can be difficulty about have often let down from wall can do so again although there be strict watch kept at gate to prevent leaving until spaniard thirst for blood be satisfied there can be no longer vigilant watch kept up by troop encamped outside ought certainly to be able to get through at night will be

suffered during siege now considered to be cheated of fair reward sum paid by city must go into hand of duke although soldier be promised share of prize money duke necessity be so great that be probable little of money must find way into hand of troop sack upon other hand be looked upon a glorious lottery one be sure to gain something many must obtain most valuable prize of money jewelry sooner therefore have haarlem surrendered than mutinous spirit began to show among troop became slack in obeying order of officer refused to perform duty gathered in body to discus wrong sulked in tent thus work of keeping vigilant watch round wall by night to prevent escape of victim selected to satiate vengeance of don frederick be greatly relaxed after lowering from wall ned proceeded with great caution on reaching spot where expected to meet with cordon of sentry be surprised at finding everything still quiet unaware of state of thing in camp suspecting that device have perhaps be hit

officer lord walsingham one of part intelligence a well a of bravery methinks may find useful in communication with prince of orange from knowledge of people may get surer intelligence from of state of feeling there with regard to alliance be proposing with to offer to come under protection than can from own envoy be advisable too at time to have two mouthpiece one to speak in public ear other to deliver private sentiment plan be young for so great responsibility lord walsingham said hesitatingly if prince of orange did not find too young to act in matter in slightest indiscretion might bring score of head to block think that can trust lord in respect youth will be distinct advantage did send personage of age rank to holland might be suspected that have special mission from envoy might complain that be treating behind back young officer like must come go without attracting observation without even philip spy suspecting that be dabbling in affair of state at time indeed queen be a

france to take estate under protection elizabeth while jealous of france be unwilling to incur expenditure in men still more money must be necessary be to assume protection of holland a sovereign under title offered to of countess of holland yet though unwilling to do be still more unwilling to see france step in occupy position offered to while above shrank from engaging at present in life

prince inclination towards french alliance what ground have for encouragement from french king upon return captain martin will render account of expense have borne will of course be defrayed expense will be small lord ned replied for chance that father ship sail tomorrow for rotterdam will take passage in while there be sure that prince whose hospitality be boundless will insist upon staying with a guest indeed seems to that must be best so for having so long be member of household will seem to have returned to resume former position public service in day of queen elizabeth be not sought for by men for sake of gain be considered highest honour to serve queen employed on embassy mission even in military command spent large sum sometimes almost beggared in order to keep up dignity worthy of position considering amply repaid for sacrifice by receiving expression of royal approval ned martin therefore returned home greatly elated at honourable mission have be intrusted to father however although also gratified at ned reception at court employment in queen service looked at from matter of fact point of view be very well ned said a be talking matter over in family conclave in evening

ned be not young noble although honour be fine thing will buy bread cheese if be heir to great estate must naturally rejoice in rendering service might bring into favour at court win for honour public

will dame martin said must have thought that must have be proud of credit honour ned be winning why neighbour be talking of nothing else neighbour will not be called upon wife to pay for master ned support to provide with courtly garment enable to maintain position will do credit to royal mistress be proud of ned a proud a anyone can be be reason why must be willing to see spend life a needy hanger on of court rather than a british sailor bearing good name in city earning fair living by honest trade ned know that be speaking only for own good court favour be empty thing good queen be fickle in liking have never hesitation in disavowing proceeding of envoy when man have broad land to fall back upon can risk loss of court favour can go into retirement assured that sooner later will again have turn such be not ned position say not that wish at once to draw back from course must have soberly think over judge whether be one in long run be likely to prove successful mr martin sister in law four girl looked anxiously at ned have since day that be first sent for to greenwich be in high state of delight at honour have befallen father word have fallen like douche of cold water upon aspiration fully recognize truth of what say father said after pause will think deeply over will have time to do before return from holland assuredly be not matter to be lightly decided may mean that royal service may lead to position of profit a well a honour although now a have put to own that prospect seems to to be slight one that where so many be ready to serve for honour alone chance of employment for one requiring money a well a honour be small however there can be need for instant decision be so fond of sea that be sure that even if away from for two three year must be ready willing to return to be a yet little over eighteen even if remained in royal service until twenty one must still have lost little of life must not be too old to take to sea again in time will see more plainly what view of lord walsingham be concerning whether there be prospect of advancement in service will know can not afford to give life to queen service without pay not being a say noble great landowner be very well spoken ned father said there be need in way for to come to resolution on subject at present will be well content to wait until come of age a say by time will see whether be brief wind of royal favour whether lord walsingham design to continue in royal service to advance fortune find that be able to get on on board ship better than have expected have wish to retire from sea at present therefore there will be plenty of time for to decide when get to age of one twenty nevertheless talk will not have be without advantage for will be far better for not to have set mind altogether upon court service will then if finally decide to return to sea not have to suffer such disappointment a must do have regarded a fixed thing that great fortune be coming to so let be understood thing that matter remains entirely open until come to age of twenty one ned accordingly went backwards forward to holland for next two year bearing letter message between queen prince of
