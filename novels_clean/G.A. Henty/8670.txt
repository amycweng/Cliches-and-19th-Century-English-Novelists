by edge of river for drift wood rejecting contained sap have offered to cut down wood with axe carried strapped to saddle hunting dog have shaken head good good said make heap smoke smoke very bad tom thought that shrub be about to cut must give out obnoxious smoke must perhaps flavour meat hanging over when indian added heap smoke red skin see long way understood that hunting dog have be so careful in choosing wood in order to avoid making smoke might attract attention of indian at distance from be first lesson in necessity for caution a darkness set in looked round several time half expecting to see crouching red skin careless demeanour of companion however reassured for felt certain that if there be fear of surprise must be watchful after supper indian talked over with jerry route must most probably have to pursue miner have never be in part of country before indeed very few white men with exception of trapper who have married indian woman have be admitted into tribe have ever penetrated into wildest portion of rocky mountain vague rumour existed of abundance of game there of existence of gold only one attempt have be made to prospect on large scale have taken place three year before when party of twenty californian miner penetrated into mountain none of returned report brought down by indian to settlement be to effect that while working gold reef have discovered be attacked killed to man by war party of sioux be mighty nigh being one of crowd jerry said when told story to tom a sat over camp fire night heard of start when got back to salt lake city after being away for time among hill legged arter a fast a must found when got to last settlement that have gone on ten day before a did not know what line have followed did not care to cross pas alone gave up mighty lucky thing be though did not think so at time why must uncle party have gone into dangerous country when knew that native be so hostile be mighty big place be pretty nigh a big a eastern state chucked into one red skin be not thick one know how many there be be agreed be not big tribe then ai like plain where party travelling can be seen by indian scout mile mile away be broken ground canyon valley rock then again when get on other side of wind river tell there be big forest be so chief be chief nodded heap forest said higher up rock bad land bad in winter snow everywhere on hill red skin not like cold too much cold wigwam good be see tom be here long way above sea level so in hill soon get above timber line be barren land there just rock without grass enough for horse in winter be so all fired cold that indian ca live there in wigwam reckon village be down in sheltered valley if have bad luck to run plump into one of may wander about mighty long time before meet with red skin be what mean be chief leaping horse grunted assent what game be there in country there be wapiti be big stag with thundering great horn there be big horn be mountain sheep be mostly up above timber line wapiti big horn be good for food skin ai worth taking off there be beaver heap of though reckon there ai a many a there be by long way for since white came out here opened trade red skin found must get good price for beaver have brought down by thousand year still there be doubt there be plenty left that trapper must do first rate there if red skin be friendly in course there be plenty of b'ars unless happen to have thundering good chance be just a well to leave b'ars alone for what with chance of getting badly mauled what with weight of skin pay even when come right side up out of tussle be there map of region none of account be just guess work may take that be just heap of mountain chucked down anyhow such map a there be have be made from tale trapper who came in with pelt have told well firstly only knew about just where tribe have joined lived in second place may bet war such fool a to tell anything a must help other fellow to get there so may put down told very little what did tell be lie day other suppose there will be expedition fitted out to go right through to punish dog goned red skin open country will be long time arter afore will be safe travelling for reckon that soldier might march march for year through mountain without ever catching sight of red skin if chose to keep out of way now reckon have best get in atween blanket two indian have already lain down by fire tom be time before must get to sleep thought of wild unknown country be about to enter with great game hidden gold treasure indian danger so excited imagination tired a be with long ride two three hour passed before fell off to sleep be awoke by being shaken somewhat roughly by jerry why be sleeping a sound a b'ar in hollow tree miner said be generally pretty spry in morning dip in cold water of river awoke tom thoroughly by time have rejoined comrade breakfast be ready ground rose rapidly a rode forward be now following indian trail slightly marked path made by indian a travelled down with pony laden with beaver skin to exchange for ammunition blanket tobacco at trading station country be barren in extreme being covered only with patch of sage brush a proceeded became more more hilly distant ridge peak must be seen a crossed over crest be bad land suppose bet be tom nothing like a bad a will see afore be done sage brush will grow pretty nigh everywhere there be thousand of square mile of rock where even sage brush can not live hill presently became broken up into fantastic shape while isolated rock pinnacle rose high above general level how curiously be coloured tom remarked just regular band of white red green orange see same marking on crag at same level just so tom reckon that country be just same down south be once level rain river torrent cut way through wore down just butte crag spire be left standing a if to show what nature of ground be everywhere though why different kind of rock have such different colour be more than can tell went out once with old party a called scientific explorer have heard say be under water once sometimes one kind of stuff settled down like mud to bottom sometimes though where water came from be more can tell said something about ground being raised afterwards suppose water run off then did not pay much attention to talk for be so choke full of larning have got such lot of hard name on tip of tongue that there be making head tail of what be saying tom have learnt something of element of geology must form idea of process by strange country at be looking have be formed that be fremont butte indian said presently pointing to flat topped hill towered above others ahead why thought said be fifty mile ride to day jerry ca have gone more than how far do suppose hill be off three four mile must think be over twenty lad up here in mountain air be so clear can see thing plain a must make out outline of down below seems to so close that must make out people walking about on top tom said little incredulously dare say lad will see when have ridden hour wo seem much closer than doe now tom found out that miner be not joking with a at first have thought be case mile after mile be ridden landmark seemed little nearer than before presently hunting dog said something to chief pointing away to right leaping horse at once reined in motioned to white companion to do same what be chief jerry asked wapiti replied that be good news miner said will be lucky if can lay in supply of deer flesh here le shoot after get through pas better will go with chief white brother have better ride on slowly leaping horse said might scare deer good lose time tom felt rather disappointed a went on slowly with jerry miner said will have plenty of chance later on lad there be time to lose in fooling about red skin will do business looking back tom saw two indian gallop away till neared crest of low swell then leapt from horse stooping low went forward in short time lay prone on ground wriggled along until just on crest reckon stag be just over there somewhere jerry said young red skin must have caught sight of antler stopped pony altogether now sat watching indian be mile away movement be a clearly visible a if be hundred yard distant chief raised on arm then on to knee moment later lay down again then crawled along parallel with crest for couple of hundred yard then paused with rifle advanced crept forward again now see jerry exclaimed indian lay for minute motionless then two tiny puff of smoke darted out indian rose to foot dashed forward a sound of shot reached ear of companion come on jerry said may be sure have brought down one stag anyhow herd must not have be far from crest boy must not have seen antler over chief be not likely to miss wapiti at hundred yard looking back presently tom saw that indian pony have disappeared ay hunting dog have come back for may be sure wo be long before be up with again in quarter of hour two indian rode up having hind quarter of deer fastened across horse behind saddle while tongue hung from peak kill at first shot chief jerry asked did not hear report close by chief said must miss seems pity to lose quantity of meat tom remarked indian seldom carry off more than hindquarter of deer never if think there be chance of getting more soon there be lot more flesh on hindquarter than there be on rest of stag that be wasteful red skin be ca be denied even when have got plenty of meat will shoot buffalo day just for sake of tongue be still early in afternoon when passed under shadow of butte two mile farther came upon small lake water from ran north here unsaddled horse prepared to camp chapter v in danger there be bush must serve purpose near lake therefore formed camp on leeward side of large boulder greatest care be observed in gathering fuel burned with clear flame without giving out slightest smoke dead wood dry like tinder in here air miner said in course if there wur red skin within two three mile on hill must make out camp still ai likely loafing indian who chanced to be hunting even fifteen mile away must see smoke if there be when red skin see smoke if ca account for be darned sartin to set about finding out who made horse fared badly for there be nothing for to pick up save mouthful of stunted grass here there plenty of grass to morrow chief said in answer to remark of tom a to scantiness of feed grass down by buffalo lake good early next morning mounted rode down hill into big wind river valley did not go down to river skirted foot of hill until reached buffalo lake there chief said pointing to pile of ash fire of white brother alighting hunting dog searched ground carefully round fire presently younger indian lightly touched chief pointed to ground talked together still carefully examining ground moved off in straight line fifty yard then returned indian here leaping horse said one two day ago found fire went off on trail of white men be bad news chief heap bad indian said gravely perhaps wo follow far tom suggested indian made answer evidently considered remark to be foolish know much of indian nature yet tom miner said when red skin come upon trail of white in what considers country will follow if take week to do till find out about if pass near one of own village will tell news score of varmint will take up trail with be ash a have done if chief here have stopped with till started must not have happened for must have seen that swept sign of fire into lake wonder did not think of be dog goned foolish trick to leave mark a expect will be more

line a there be only one mark beat how must know jerry white man always turn out toe lad indian walk straight footed there be other difference that red skin must see at once be beyond for have never done tracking work indian without speaking led to point twenty yard away pointed to impression be so slight that be with difficulty that tom must make out outline yes settle jerry said see lad when there be only one mark must not tell whether be turned out not for must depend on direction man be walking in one be just in line with other so foot must have be set down straight have be turned out bit line carried straight through first footprint must have gone five six yard away to right took tom two three minute to reason out to at last understood drift of what companion said a line through one toe heel passed along centre of other foot must time have be put down in straight line while if footprint have be made by person who turned out toe must never point straight towards farther on well what be advice chief jerry asked must camp eat indian replied horse gone far enough fear here red skin gone on trail do think there have be more than one chief not know leaping horse said find out by by tom now noticed that hunting dog have disappeared where will make fire chief pointed to ash be jerry said if red skin came along see tom there must be nothing to tell that more than one party have be here chief time undertook collection of fuel bright fire be presently burning two hour later hunting dog came back talked for time earnestly with chief taking out two leaf from wampum bag opened showed two tiny heap of black dust jerry asked question until conversation be done then while hunting dog cut off large chunk of deer flesh placing in hot ash sat quietly down to wait until be cooked said well chief what be news indian have horse hunting dog came upon spot where have left hundred yard away when saw ash came to look at afterwards followed trail quite plain on soft ground at head of lake over there pointed to foot of hill indian stopped fired twice how on earth did know chief chief pointed to two leaf scout examined powder wad said be leather wad tom shrivelled burnt what did fire at chief signal half mile farther three other mounted redskin joined stopped have heap talk then one rode away into hill others went on at gallop on trail be bad chief fellow who went up

for gold may not have got far away have better be pushing on chief good horse make three day journey rest well to day travel right on to morrow if go farther to night little good to morrow good camp here rest well doubt be right chief worry one to think that while be sitting here 'tarnal red skin may be attacking friend only hope be that harry who have done lot of indian fighting will hide trail a much a possible a go on that will have lot of trouble in finding chief nodded white brother harry know indian way did not think have come to indian country here must not have left ash beyond will be sure to hide trail 'rappahoes will have to follow slow think be 'rappahoes chief yes 'rappahoe country shoshone be further north be friendly bannacks nez perces be in northwest near snake river sioux

be many stream coming down from hill into big wind can turn up down of a please land on rocky ground too so must be easy matter to track by lay of country there doe not seem much chance of gold anywheres about here a reckon will be thinking more of than of beaver skin so think must push straight on harry said must get out of big wind river valley quick leaping horse said too many indian there get into mountain other side go up riviere de noir then over big mountain into sierra shoshone then down buffalo through jackson hole then strike snake river told heap bad indian in jackson hole

brought into tom reckoned must not get out without trouble did not calkerlate on getting into so soon did not bring here jerry so need not blame for that be brought into for did not make up mind to come till have settled to go with leaping horse reckon must have come anyhow jerry grumbled directly chief said where harry others have gone mind be set on joining be new country there wur saying what might strike though ai regular indian fighter leaving alone when leave alone ca say a be averse to scrimmage with if odds be anyways equal be wonderful country tom said looking at almost perpendicular cliff across valley with regular coloured marking deep fissure crag pinnacle worth coming long way to see say a ai curous have seen like down on colorado care if never see more of if carry scalp safe

together baited hook be scarcely thrown into water when be seized in quarter of hour ten fine lake trout be lying on bank tom be much delighted have fished from boat have never met with much success pleasure at landing five fish averaging four five pound apiece be great a be evidently useless to catch more wound up line hunting dog split fish open laid down on rock be so hot that tom must scarce bear hand on seeing elder men engaged in talk tom did not return to endeavoured to keep up conversation with young indian whom found to be willing enough to talk now be alone who knew much more english than have given credit for a soon a sun set fire be extinguished lay down to sleep shortly afterwards hour before daylight be in saddle hunting dog rode ahead on line have followed day before a soon a became light tom kept eye fixed upon ground be only now then when indian pointed to print of horse hoof in sand between rock that must make out two indian followed track however without slightest difficulty horse going at hand gallop look to like horse footprint tom said to jerry when have passed spot where mark be unusually clear reckon have never seen track of unshod horse before tom with shod horse see nothing mark of shoe here get print of whole hoof harry have be careful enough here have taken shoe off pony for among mark have not seen made by shod horse indian never shoe theirs mark of iron be enough to tell first red skin who pass that white man have gone along there chief took off shoe of four horse yesterday afternoon when be fishing put nail by to use when get out of dog goned country after riding for two hour came to bank of stream chief held up hand for to stop while dismounted examined foot mark then mounted again rode across stream be ten yard wide from two to three foot deep went on short distance beyond leapt from saddle threw rein on horse neck returned to bank on foot went short distance up stream then a much down stooping low examining inch of ground then stood up told others to cross illustration leaping horse mounted rode across stream leave horse by mine said a joined trail very bad rock spoke to young indian who on dismounting at once went forward quartering ground like spaniel in search of game while chief a carefully searched along bank best leave to tom know what be doing be hunting for trail jerry suppose ay lad harry struck on good place when crossed where did for see rock here be a smooth a top of table wind have swept a clean of dust a if have be done by eastern woman broom if horse have be shod there must have be scratch on rock must have be enough for dullest indian to follow unshod horse leaf mark on ground like expect red skin who followed be just a much puzzled a chief be there ai saying whether crossed went straight on whether never crossed at kept in stream up down be hour before two indian have concluded examination of ground well chief what do make of jerry asked when have spoken few word together hunting dog have good eye chief said white men went forward red men must not find trail thought that have kept in river so went up to search for come let go forward miner tom mounted horse indian led forward three hundred yard then hunting dog pointed down chief stooped low examined spot what be chief jerry asked tom got off knelt down must see nothing be leaping horse said pointed to piece of rock projecting inch above flat be darned if can see anything there be tiny hair there tom said putting face within few inch of ground might be cat hair be about length much thicker be brown good chief said putting hand on tom shoulder now let ride leapt into saddle others following example went on at same pace a before well chief miner said what doe hair tell about for ca make head tail of white men killed deer on way up here cut up hide made shoe for horse so that must leave track one of horse trod on little rock hair came out of hide may be chief miner said after thinking matter over though ai much of thing to go by good enough leaping horse said know now line be taking when get to soft ground see trail plainer what will others do when can not find trail anywhere along bank ride straight on chief said search bank of next river look at mouth of valley to make sure white men have not gone up there meet more of tribe search everywhere closely find trail at last well ought to give harry good start anyhow not know how long gone on chief said gravely rainfall six eight perhaps only two day start if always hide trail a well a did here see how indian can find at especially a know where be making for a do find camp men on foot may hide trace with horse sure to find be so jerry agreed shaking head indian can see with eye where grass have be cropped leaf stripped off bush yes be afraid be so there ai no hiding camp from indian eye where horse have be about be sure to be near stream will look for chief indian shook head lose time said go straight to riviere de noir think then be likely to turn off before leaping horse think not know indian about here perhaps found indian trail near first camp know anyhow many indian think push straight on be likeliest anyhow by keeping on must get nearer to worst danger seems to that may overtake red skin who be hunting chief nodded be fired fix tom jerry went on if go slow may not be in time to help harry others to save scalp if go fast may come on 'tarnal red skin have mighty hard work in keeping own have r on feel sure that chief will find trace of in time to prevent running into jerry look how good eye be why might have searched life without noticing single hair on rock after riding fifteen mile beyond stream crossing two similar though smaller rivulet chief after few word with jerry turned off to left followed foot of hill at mouth of narrow valley stopped examined ground carefully then led way up carrying rifle in readiness across peak of saddle valley opened when have passed mouth thick grove of tree grew along bottom a soon a be beneath shelter dismounted horse at once began to crop grass hunting dog went forward through tree rifle in hand will take bit out of horse mouth jerry tom asked not till young indian return be not likely there be red skin village up there for must have seen trail down below if there have be still there may be hut two can hing till come back be hour before hunting dog came through tree again shook head without word loosened girth of horse took off bridle have seen sign of so can light fire get something to eat be beginning to feel want something badly thus reminded tom felt at once that be desperately hungry have before starting taken few mouthful of meat have be cooked day before purposely left over be now three o'clock in afternoon felt ravenous indian quickly collected dried wood four of fish be soon frizzling on hot ash while kettle hung in flame be beginning to sing have done nigh forty mile tom horse must have couple of hour rest will push on a fast a can before dark then wait until moon rise will be up by ten ai country to ride over in dark will hide up before morning not go on again till next night of course will not go so fast a by day sha' have risk of being ambushed chief reckons from what have heard that indian village be thick along part of valley that will never do to travel by day then have given up hope of finding harry track must be just wasting time to look for will push on sharp till be sure be ahead of may light upon by chance there can be searching for with red varmint round must be just chucking away life without chance of doing good expect harry party be travelling at night too wo travel a fast a by sight have got pack pony with be likely to lay off day two if come upon good place for hiding travelled few mile after halt for indian declared must make out smoke rising in two three place ahead although jerry tom must distinguish knew that indian sight be much keener than own in matter of kind therefore halted again behind mass of rock have fallen down mountain side hunting dog lay down among highest of boulder to keep watch horse be hobbled to prevent straying miner chief pipe tom lay down on back for sleep short time before became dusk call of deer be heard there be wapiti chief ca take shot at matter have meat enough for week chief have already risen to foot rifle in hand be signal from hunting dog said have seen something in valley white brother have better get horse together made way up rock in minute two called out that horse might be left to feed presently came leisurely

dog who brought up rear tom have be warned that on account be to speak aloud if have anything want to say feel that must say bust jerry remarked just come up alongside of whisper keep eye open rifle handy might come upon party minute might be going back to village after following harry trail a long a must track might be messenger coming back to fetch up food fellow hunting dog made out going on to join in front anyhow have got to travel a quiet a if there be ear round a passed clump of tree where indian village stood must see reflection of fire on foliage heard frequent barking of dog occasional shout quarter of mile farther chief halted spoke to hunting dog who at once dismounted glided away towards village gone to see how many men there chief said in explanation to jerry too much laugh good mean men must have gone off again tom if there be men in camp boy must not be making noise be few hundred yard from tree in very short time indian returned men be gone said only squaw boy there how many lodge be there chief asked hunting dog held up hand with extended finger then one finger only eleven of jerry said expect be small village move lodge across into forest when winter come on a soon a have mounted chief put horse into canter at pace went forward for hour breaking into walk occasionally for few minute thought said must not go beyond walk to night jerry tom remarked on first of occasion be what kinder agreed lad may be sure chief have good reason for going on faster dunno what be ai going to ask red skin hate being questioned if want to tell will tell without being asked faint light be stealing over sky when chief halted horse sat listening sound however broke stillness of night did think heard anything chief leaping horse heard nothing stopped to listen what doe white brother think of 'rappahoes having gone on directly returned from chase thought that when got news that white men have gone through might have started to join following up trail be that what think chief only three white men plenty indian on trail hurry to follow might have have feast after hunt gone on in morning so might think white have be tracked be to be attacked morning perhaps attacked yesterday perhaps have got strong place 'rappahoes want more help to take white rifle shoot straight perhaps want more men to starve out again went forward at gallop now jerry did not think much of chief idea seemed to natural that indian must want to join in hunt for scalp to get share of white men good though admitted that be strange must have gone on without taking meal presently chief reined in horse again sat with head bent forward tom angry grunt from between hunting dog teeth listening intently also be conscious of faint far away sound hear chief said to jerry heard something might be anything waterfall in hill mile away be what sound like gun chief said laconically do think so jerry said doubtfully there seem to anything of gun in be just sort of murmur keep on on be mountain speaking back again chief said waving hand hill everywhere say to other red men who live in bosom be attacking pale face stranger what do think hunting dog tom whispered to indian gun shot replied in tone of absolute conviction waal chief will not gainsay opinion jerry said how far do think be off horse will take there in two hour chief replied then can put at twenty mile at least let be going whatever sound be will know more about before have gone much farther not too fast leaping horse said a miner be urging horse forward maybe have to fight maybe have to run no good tire horse too much be more than hour before tom must hear distinct change in character of sound at last be able to notice that though seemingly continuous sound really pulsated sometimes almost died away then suddenly swelled out again there be several vibration close together jerry more accustomed to sound of firearm in mountain have before come round to chief opinion be gun sure enough tom chief have made mistake about waal there be one comfort ai be surprised be making good fight of may be there in time to take hand in game will ride straight on join reckon not lad must wait until see what sort of place harry be in how can best help before fix on scheme sound became louder clearer echo be still continuous sound of shot must be distinctly heard be over there to right jerry said must have crossed big wind river gone up de noir valley chief said ought to be close to now yes reckon ca be far off by what told about distance better cross big wind at once see now agree with chief must not do for to get sight of if did case must be worse than harry expect have got strongly posted must have be wiped out long ago be what must happen to if be to make out spy number afore get to place where be outfit can help other rode rapidly down to river with exception of few yard in middle where horse have to swim depth be not great be soon on other side rode to foot of hill then kept along sound of firing became louder louder tom felt heart beat quickly at thought that might soon be engaged in desperate fight with indian that with odds greatly against party presently hill fell sharply away be at entrance of valley of riviere de noir be principal arm of big wind river at point firing have very much died out during last few minute only occasional shot be heard have beat off attack so far jerry said to encouragingly now have got to lie low bit while chief see how thing stand leaping horse dismounted at mouth of narrow canyon running up into cliff beside little stream trickled down centre must not have be better jerry said here be place four must hold against crowd of red skin for hour there be water anyway where there be water there be mostly little feed for horse will take horse chief tom will take hunting dog if so be mean to go with worry lad went on seeing how anxious tom looked a started with horse up canyon if harry friend have beaten off first attack may bet boot be safe for time be clear red skin have drawn off be holding pow wow a to how be to try next attacked see just a day be breaking be favourite hour reckon harry must have be expecting that mate be prepared chapter vi united canyon showed sign of widening until have proceeded quarter of mile from entrance then broadened suddenly for distance of hundred yard there have be big slip here side miner said looking round must have taken place great many year ago for winter flood have swept away sign of there be grass tree on slope horse can find enough to keep alive here for day two be will want hope must be nasty place to get out of jerry for cliff be perpendicular from half way up ai likely a there be place must get out without following to upper end may be fifty mile away know country run through red skin be pretty certain to know about if be to track here must never try to fight way in must just set guard at mouth at upper end starve out be good place to hide in dog goned bad one to be caught in however hope ai coming to that be who be going to attack not that make difference red skin ca have notion that there be other white men in neighbourhood when open fire on will raise such scare for bit that will give chance of joining others if choose that of course must depend on position walked back to mouth of canyon have not to wait long for return of indian come leaping horse said briefly at once turning going off at swift pace jerry asked question with tom followed close on indian heel there be bush growing among fallen rock debris from face of cliff be therefore able to go forward a quickly a must leap from boulder to boulder without fear of being seen quarter of hour run chief climbed up to ledge on face of cliff where stratum harder than above have resisted effect of weather formed shelf twelve foot wide went down on hand knee keeping close to wall crawled along to spot where stunted bush have made good hold others followed lying down behind bush peered through valley be four five hundred yard wide down centre ran stream close to water edge rose abruptly steep rock be fifty foot in height four five yard across at top on north west rock be too perpendicular to be climbed other side have crumbled down stone being covered with brushwood from point where be looking must see six horse lying among bush be evidently tightly roped have probably be led up there when attack began thrown at highest point to must be taken spot being chosen where bush concealed exact position from below rock be about two hundred fifty yard from spot where party be lying position be about level with top twenty indian be gathered few hundred yard higher up valley about a many distance down why did varmint take place here jerry whispered to chief came here see pointed to patch of blood few foot beyond indian gun not shoot far said powder weak white man rifle carry here red skin not able to shoot so far when found that went away again what be going to do now do think soon attack again hour passed then loud yell gave signal two troop galloped towards rock have evidently have experience of accuracy of white men fire not indian showed dropping over one side of pony with arm resting in rope round animal neck one leg thrown over back so dashed forward until close to foot of rock instant must have thrown from horse taken to bush although hidden from sight of defender of position be exposed to full view of party on ledge from whom be distant not more than two hundred yard chief fired first almost together other three rifle flashed out three of indian fell from horse almost slipped off with effort recovered hold with leg yell of astonishment fear broke from indian a two band mingled together of rider be exposed to on top of rock three shot be fired two more of 'rappahoes fell whole band in obedience to shout from one of chief galloped at full speed down valley three men sprang to foot waving hat while party on ledge also leapt up with shout be chief see one of on rock shouted have be hoping ever since morning to hear crack of rifle never heard more welcome sound must have be rubbed out sure who have got with be jerry curtis harry come up along with leaping horse though did not expect to find in bad fix young indian be hunting dog young chap next to be nephew tom wade did not expect to meet like reckon while have be speaking have reloaded rifle have best go across talk over with harry chief consart measure with for getting out of fix red skin have got bad scare may bet ai gone far have lost six of buck now beside what others shot before ai in indian natur for to put up with loss a that have be looking at rock a spoke turning round uttered exclamation of surprise for chief be no longer there looking down saw that have managed to make way down face of cliff in two minute be ascending rock there stood for time in earnest conversation with white then returned to ledge trouble over horse said ay ay reckoned be what be talking over there ai going back for now chief shook head keep watch said can not go till night to fetch horse lie here to day go across to rock when darkness come then white men go up valley till get to tree hour march away can see from rock get in among tree work up into hill leaping horse hunting dog cross river go down other side past 'rappahoes then cross back get into canyon drive horse up white men meet up in mountain seems good plan enough chief be if can get out at other end of canyon canyon little up high chief replied find place to climb may find horse to day indian nodded may find perhaps not why must not go across to rock at once chief indian count on finger how many know only four much troubled in mind where men come from who can be red skin not like white men have many fancy fire come out of bush where 'rappahoe have be killed think that bad medicine keep together talk think if men here why not go across to rock must not be surprised if be right chief be more likely to fancy have come down from above than from below for must have reckoned for sure there be other white men in big wind valley not showing ourselves will give fired scare what doe chief mean by bad medicine jerry tom asked red skin be full of sort of idea anything ca make head tail of be bad medicine think there be magic in that old nick have have finger in pie when get idea like in mind even bravest of loses pluck be like child who think have seen ghost be mighty good notion for to lie low day red skin will reason out will say if be white men who killed brother why 'tarnal go join others there ai nothing to prevent if ai white men who be maybe can move without being able to see will shoot from other place reckon be likely will keep pretty close together wo venture to scatter to look for track in case chief plan will work out right in course good deal depends on chief one of be among shot can make out feather from here if be bos chief may be that will give up altogether next chief will throw blame on to may like enough persuade to draw off altogether if ai bos chief then be bound to try again must not like to take back to village with news that grist of have be killed narry scalp taken expect will see afternoon of come down to palaver with morning passed quietly not unpleasantly for be lying in shade before noon sun have climbed up over cliff behind shone down with great force have to lie with head well under bush to screen from ray presently leaping horse said indian chief come lift head shifted position so a to look down valley indian chief holding up hand to show that be unarmed be advancing on foot accompanied by indian also without arm there be harry going down to meet jerry said tom looked eagerly at figure came down from rock advanced to meet indian seemed strange to that after having come so far to join uncle must remain for hour in sight of other without meeting be too far to distinguish feature saw by light walk easy swing of figure that uncle be much more active man than have expected to see have known indeed that be forty year old have somehow expected that life of hardship have led must have aged be surprised to see that walk figure be of young man be not rather dangerous coming down alone to meet two of may have arm hidden have got arm maybe sure jerry replied have knife for certain most likely tomahawk expect harry have got six shooter matter whether have not there be two mate up on rock with rifle be across here 'rappahoes must know well enough life must be worth red cent if be to try of game mean business will make out have come to persuade harry mate to give up know quite well ai fool enough to do what be really in mind be to try find out who be where have come from conversation lasted few minute tom must see that question be being asked about concealed party for chief pointed to ledge two three time when talk be over indian went down valley again at slow pace never once looking back englishman returned to rock suppose have got much from harry suppose uncle talk language reckon know 'rappahoe dialect tribe on western side of plain can mostly understand other talk a know can get on well with ute be sure to be able to understand 'rappahoes talk leaping horse will go along ledge chief said few minute later after short conversation with hunting dog 'rappahoes will try to find out who be here not like to attack rock till find out two indian lay down flat on ledge crawled along without raising in slightest until reached point where cliff projected somewhat from here must see down valley lay immovable with rifle in front of be not more than fifty yard so from bush where got up on to ledge be where red skin be likely to try crawling up for there must be out of sight of rock surely must never venture to come along ledge in daylight jerry must have to pas along under fire of uncle mate must have rifle to meet in front must only be one at most two scout must reckon that from point where chief be lying must get view right along ledge to here be able to make out what be be strangeness of thing have kept quiet hour expect chief will want to prove that there be only few of that be men for certain reckon have sent off to village already there will be more of varmint here to night indian be never fond of attacking in dark still if be sure about might try must know must get up to foot of rock before being seen once among bush must reckon must make easy work of quarter of hour later there be crack of rifle followed instantly by indian yell be chief piece tom reckon lead have gone straight silence remained unbroken for next two hour then leaping horse crawled back a quietly a have gone what be chief be 'rappahoe who will scout more chief said quietly came up bush before must step on to ledge leaping horse fired will take tale back to tribe wo try again chief leaping horse shook head first take rock said then when have scalp of white men will watch here will know can not stay here long without water be right there chief mbetake tongue be like piece of leather now a soon a get dark will make bee line down to river want to have talk with harry just at present want drink blamed sight worse if have thought be going to be stuck up here day must have brought water bottle with time passed very slowly although air became cooler a soon a sun have gone down behind opposite range a soon a light faded little indian crawled farther along ledge returned in short time saying that have found spot where white must descend two three time jerry urged that be dark enough before chief consented to move at last however stood up gave cry of owl be in minute two joined by hunting dog who have until now remained at post chief at once led way along ledge until reached spot where rock have crumbled away somewhat have better go down one at time jerry said for if there be slip tumble might let down gun hammer want lead for 'rappahoes not for other when came to tom turn found very difficult place to get down in semi darkness two three time almost lost footing a soon a be down fell into indian file crossed valley to rock chief giving hoot of owl twice a approached three men at once stepped out from bush at foot began to wonder when be coming be just going to get pony down before be too dark to do without running risk of breaking leg well be right glad to see jerry too tom though be too dark to see much of chief have be telling how brought along there be time to talk now be right glad to see lad shook tom heartily by hand now mate let get horse down must make track for water first harry young un be pretty near choking expect indian be a bad though ai natur to talk about get down horse first chief said too dark soon waal suppose five minute wo make much difference jerry grumbled so here go have tied hide over hoof harry said so a to make a little noise a possible about must make noise chief said urgently redskin scout soon be crawling up one by one horse be brought down harry leading others pushing aside bush a noiselessly a possible then load be carried down packed upon get on horse jerry harry wade whispered will walk with tom have have time to say word to yet to ask about people at home where be chief leaping horse companion have stolen away a soon a load have be adjusted others led horse to river allowed to drink while jerry tom lay down took long draught of water miner bottle be filled then started be lucky river make roar among rock here harry said will drown sound of horse hoof for hour proceeded at fast walk then skin be taken off horse foot went on at trot two wade taking hold of jerry stirrup leather running alongside in hour entered belt of tree dismounting at once began to ascend hill be distance up when heard distant yell may yell a much a like jerry panted wo catch now have be mighty long time finding out be gone must not make out about harry said must see by chief manner glance indian with kept giving to place where be lying that be puzzled alarmed offered if must surrender that must allow to return down valley without hurt said of course preferred staying where be have come up valley intended going farther did want to interfere with if have left alone must have left alone have only to thank for loss of of brave have ' said beany friend who will protect much harm will fall on indian who venture to meddle with ' 'be friend white men chief asked 'have wing that have flown down here from hill 'they have come be enough ' said see when be wanted be here if be wanted again will hear of brave will die will gain nothing have best go back to lodge leave to go away in peace whoever be can shoot a have found out to cost have ill will to red skin providing redskin let alone only fired four shot if have wished to must have killed many more when chief saw that must get nothing further from went away a usual spoke boastfully at last said that have offered peace to if war came must be fault laughed said that must take care of ourselves preferred doing so to trusting in hand of 'rappahoes when have made of squaw widow must have kept word uncle do think tom asked not there be few of indian tribe whose word can be taken a rule word mean nothing with if have put ourselves in power must have tomahawked instantly else taken down tortured at village must have be deal have doubt have long talk after chief returned to that be time after became dark before must pluck up courage enough to climb rock though expect must have got close to very soon after left reckon have be crawling up inch by inch of course directly got to where horse have be tied knew have gone expect that yell be signal for rush forward to top need not bother more about may ride a far a foot of forest when find have gained that safely will give up until morning will know well enough be good starting to search wood in dark may a well rest where be until moon be up for make so much noise crashing through undergrowth that must hear down there now tell lad about mother sister how came out after tom told uncle of mother death reason why have left sister to come out to join be very bad business lad take lot of blame to myself when got mother letter telling of poor john death that must not hear of coming out said very hard thing to myself here have be knocking about for twenty year having have fair share of luck yet must

not be thrown away reckoned that must be out before long for be certain that if be lad of spirit must not be staying there doing nothing mother said that girl intended to take up teaching be not likely that must let work for family while be loafing about at home know in time be hard enough to get anything to do there young fellow who have come out here to ranche tell that be harder than ever now thought must fancy life that in time must talk mother over into letting come must never have got to agree to uncle wanted to go to sea after father death must not hear of said be only boy that

on saddle although have tasted nothing for twenty four hour tom however le accustomed to enforced fast felt ravenous have have nothing to eat to day uncle except crust left over from yesterday baking

daybreak one of went up hillside twice made out mounted indian moving about down valley yesterday morning ten of came galloping up within easy shot think thought that be so near drew up horse suddenly have talk then came riding after did need yell to tell intention be knocked three of out of saddle then threw horse down lay behind galloped round round shooting picked two more off then rode away knew enough of to be sure that be not going to give up must follow till joined by enough of tribe to attack again made long march hoping to get to timber before must come up just a sun be setting saw coming along about fifteen of have just time to get up to rock a rode past opened smart fire dropped four of others rode up valley so a to cut off from going farther filled water skin got horse way up a saw then lighted fire cooked kept watch night two down below one at top everything be quiet guessed be waiting for others to come up about hour before daylight heard gang arrive below halted there be not long before began crawling up from above below for bit shot pretty brisk odds be too much against with on height drew off then for hour be pretty quiet while be holding council except that did shooting with party who have climbed up to ledge opposite then saw band mount reckoned be going to make dash for knew if did in earnest must go down for once among rock bush there must be keeping from mounting up made up mind that end be not far off though fancy must have accounted for good many of before rubbed out when four rifle spoke from ledge thought be party who have gone back there for felt sure that have driven away be more than moment before saw be that there be mistaking yell of astonishment from indian a horse swerved round saw that three of have fallen may guess did stop to argue who be set to work to do share seemed to something like miracle when red skin rode off have be talking of leaping horse during night for have promised to come back to join knew well enough to be able to bet creation that must come have only left to keep appointment with nephew who be to join at fort bridger if there have only be two gun fired must have put down to being four think of thought of till stood up shouted now lad have better take sleep will be moving on a soon a moon be fairly up wo be over hill behind till two three will watch till then think there be least chance of following to night have be pretty roughly handled think will follow until have solved mystery of ledge searched doubt a soon a found rock be empty at daybreak will set about tracing trail up will be easy enough for when have once got rid of idea that there be something uncanny about then will have on heel again on chief too first thing for to do will be to make along hill till get to edge of canyon where leaping horse have gone for pony to follow to upper end will watch uncle if will wake in hour will be right after nap can scarcely keep eye open now seemed however to tom that have not be asleep five minute when uncle shook others be already on foot moon be shining down through tree with cautious step taking utmost trouble to avoid branch started on upward climb not word be spoken for knew how far sound travel on still night there be however slight breeze moving among tree top when started in hour have so far increased that bough be swaying leaf rustling reckon there ai occasion to keep mouth shut no longer one of men said now that tree be on move must not hear if be only hundred yard away be glad when daylight began to appear tom because climbing must be much easier when ground must be seen others because be longing for pipe have hitherto not dared to light one for flash of match must be seen far away have be bearing steadily to right a mounted shortly after daybreak suddenly found on edge of canyon do think be one jerry one of men asked that be more than can tell ben did not see opening in valley a came up might very well have missed one in dark must think from distance have gone towards right must be one where left horse anyhow whether be not must follow up to top wait there for bit to see if chief come reckon will be there before harry said be if got round red skin right found horse there must be reason for to wait expect must go straight on be like enough to be waiting for by time chapter vii chased party pressed forward a rapidly a must ground be rough at time

of will go up on to ledge where be follow track down to canyon where left horse find that came up valley not down will have made out that there be two white two red skin that two red skin have gone up canyon with horse directly matter be cleared up will be hotter than ever for scalp for there be nothing red skin hate worse than being fooled of course will know that be good deal harder to wipe out seven men than three think will attack openly know well enough that in fair fight two red skin if not three be likely to go down for white rub out will bide time red skin be wonderful hand at time be nothing to must not mind hanging about for week week if can get at last however will talk over when indian join think there be chance of fighting to day whether will get out of mountain without having scrimmage be doubtful tom noticed that in talk with uncle dropped most of western expression when speaking with others used a freely a did be now able to have fair look at found that agreed pretty

action be pleasant to think that there be spy watching now uncle do not close tom must know better than that must see mile away if be to mount ride off be only when get dark that must venture to crawl up for if one be sighted in daytime must not have ghost of chance of getting away for must ride down sartin well reckon may a well take sleep sam hick said lie down for one anyhow harry for watched last evening will toss up of keep awake leaping horse will keep watch chief said quietly fear of indian better to watch knowing power of red skin to keep awake for almost unlimited time none of others

eye open rifle handy tom uncle said be like enough that young brave anxious to distinguish may crawl up with intention of stampeding pony though think must attempt till thought most of be asleep still there be saying watch be undisturbed soon became so dark that object must no longer be seen fifty yard away tom began to feel nervous tuft of ground little bush seemed to to take form of crawling indian felt great sense of relief when saw figure round fire rise walk towards be glad have come uncle said frankly began to feel very uncomfortable several time seemed to that of bush moved be just what thought must be feeling tom be just a well that first watch must be short one without much chance of ambush being on foot knew that if eye deceived hunting dog be there next time wo feel so nervous that sort of thing soon pass off fresh armful of brushwood have be thrown on to fire before men left long after have ridden away must see flame mounting high after riding north for quarter of hour changed route passed round leaving fire half mile on right light of star be quite sufficient for to travel by after four hour journey chief who be riding ahead halted not far from canyon now listen very faint murmur came to ear so faint that have not attention be drawn to tom must not have noticed at what be noise asked that be stream down in canyon uncle replied how far be from head chief not far must ride slow proceeded at walk changing course little towards east hunting dog went on ahead in quarter of hour heard signal cry of owl arose from point still further east quickening pace in few minute came up to young indian who be standing by horse at edge of steep descent at bottom of tom must see stream of water look very steep jerry said steep indian replied came up here with horse morning dismounted tom went up to horse head wo do tom never go before horse down steep place where ca see way always drive before there be trouble in getting horse to commence descent after short time chief pony set example tucking hind leg under until sat down on haunch began to slide down while other animal after staring into darkness with ear laid back snorting with fear be half persuaded half forced to follow example men went down after descent be not so steep a in darkness looked depth be not over fifty foot a soon a reached bottom mounted again chief leading way rode down canyon at first be able to proceed at fair pace a side grew higher more precipitous darkness became more dense be obliged to pick way with great caution among boulder strewed bottom of ravine several time have to dismount in order to get horse over heavy fall be four hour from time entered canyon before approached mouth when entered little wood where have first left horse chief said make fire cook

give good lesson make mighty keerful wo care about showing ugly head within range of piece will carry five hundred yard quarter of hour passed without movement on part of indian then large party of horseman appeared from tree below be greeted by with yell of satisfaction there must be well nigh fifty of jerry said reckon be party came down hill must have picked up good many others by way now fun

effect indian advance be no longer rapid be conducted with greatest caution be only occasionally that glimpse must be caught of dusky figure passing from rock to rock when came within three hundred yard two indian jerry also opened fire one fell to shot from chief of others hit mark tom indeed did not fire again movement of indian being so rapid that be gone before must bring sight to bear upon of go now chief said 'rappahoes fire soon run quick be few yard to shelter a dashed across intervening space two three indian rifle rang out rest of assailant have be too much occupied in sheltering looking for next spot to make for to keep eye upon defender hastily fired shot missed moment later party mounted horse rode up ravine yell of indian ringing in ear illustration moment later indian fell forward on face chapter viii in safety have gained hour anyhow jerry said a galloped up ravine reckon by time overtake will find stowed away in place where will puzzle red skin to dislodge varmint will fight hard if be cornered ai good at advancing when there be few rifle tube in hand of white men pointing at have have lesson now that can shoot ravine continued to narrow stream have become mere rivulet be high up on hillside begin to be afeared there ai place for making stand here be interrupted by angry growl a great bear suddenly rose to foot behind rock may thank star that be too busy to attend to jerry said a rode past within few yard of be grizzly tom awkward beast must have found if have come upon by without shooting iron be big one too skin must have be worth money down in settlement ah there be ravine made abrupt turn to west high up on side saw three companion with five horse climbing up precipitous rock how ever did get up there jerry exclaimed found indian

said from rear knew that indian trail led up valley jee rusalem be steep road jerry said presently be dog goned if can guess how red skin ever discovered expect must have tracked game up followed to see where went to trail wound about in wonderful way sometimes went horizontally along narrow ledge then there be bit of steep climbing where have to lead horse then wound back again sometimes even descended for distance to avoid projecting crag ah must ye yer varmint jerry exclaimed a shot rang out from valley below bullet flattened against rock within foot two of head shot be followed by loud yell from below a crowd of mounted indian rode at full gallop round angle of ravine hurry on hunting dog get round next corner for be regular target here few yard farther turn of path took out of sight of indian not before score of bullet came whistling up from below varmint have be riding too fast to shoot straight reckon will be turn directly just a spoke chief called upon to dismount threw

at top of track air too bad being out of ben said hope have given of varmint grist only five six of jerry replied regretfully counting in one leaping horse shot at village tom here did big shot brought one down in track at good four hundred yard a neat shot a ever saw fired chief accounted for then atween wiped out two down below reckon of others be carrying of lead away waal think have shook off at last how suppose there ai other road can come up here by chief leaping horse only heard of one trail may bet life there ai harry remarked must never have used dog goned road a if there have be other way of going up camp here chief said long journey over pas too much cold keep watch here at head of trail be very good plan have heard that pas be over nine thousand foot above sea must never do to have to camp up there besides have be looking at sky much like appearance look over there to north there be indeed evident sign of approaching change in weather on previous day peak jagged crest stood out hard distinct in clear air now higher summit be hidden by bank of white cloud snow indian said gravely winter coming be just what thought chief at rate know where be here there be brushwood to be gathered not far down trail even if be shut up here can manage well enough for day two early snow lie long to be caught in snow storm higher up must be sight worse than fighting with red skin from spot where be now standing at edge of ravine ground sloped very steeply up for hundred of foot then steep crag rose in unbroken wall from view have have of country from other side knew that behind wall rose range of lofty summit indian trail ran along close to edge of ravine chief looked round earnestly good place to camp said wind blow down hill horse not able to stand against heap snow tumble down from there pointed upwards carry everything down below well if think have better push on let do so chief indian shook head pointed to cloud again see said storm come very soon even in last two three minute change be perceptible upper edge of cloud seemed to be suddenly broken up long streamer spread out like signal flag of danger mass of cloud seemed to be wrenched off to fly with great rapidity for short distance of sinking little floated back until again formed part of mountain cap while others sped onwards towards south time chief repeated earnestly must look for camp quick spoke in indian tongue to hunting dog two stood on point where ground jutted out closely examined ravine up whose side have climbed chief pointed farther along hunting dog started at run along indian trail few hundred yard farther paused looked down moved few step farther then disappeared from sight in three four minute returned held up arm come chief said taking horse rein led along path others followed example glad indeed to be in motion five minute before have be bathed in perspiration from climb up cliff now be conscious of extraordinary change of temperature have suddenly set in have snatched blanket from behind saddle wrapped round soon reached spot where hunting dog be standing looked down thirty foot below there be sort of split in face of cliff wall of rock rising to within four five foot of level of edge of ravine at one end touched face of rock at other be ten twelve foot from space between being in form of long wedge be completely filled up with tree brushwood ledge ran down from point where hunting dog be standing to mouth of fissure jee rusalem chief ben exclaimed that air just made for must not have found better not if have sarched for year reckon will have to clear place bit before take critter down two ax be taken from one of pack horse cut away bigger stuff ben harry said a two mate proceeded down ledge head will shelter from snow bit only clear away bush enough to give room for horse leave standing across entrance to make screen while be doing will fetch in a much more wood grass a can get hold of before snow begin to fall horse be left standing while men scattered along top of ravine by time ben shouted that be ready considerable pile of brushwood heap of coarse grass have be collected horse be then led down one by one unsaddled packed together in two line having beyond great pile of bush have be cut away be dog goned if ai best shelter ever struck upon jerry said must not have fixed upon better if have have built special others cordially agreed place occupied be of twelve foot square on side be perpendicular wall of rock beyond be horse while at entrance bush from three to four foot high have be left standing above stretched canopy of foliage enough dry wood have be collected to start fire make too big jerry want to scorch up roof harry wade said well reckon have got enough fuel here for week for there be what cut down what brought be left standing beyond horse with leaf grass pony must be able to hold out a long a fuel last be short of meat have plenty of flour a for water can melt snow buffalo rug be laid down on side by rock wall on took seat lighted pipe have be wanting smoke pretty bad jerry said ai have one since halted in there canyon hello here come a spoke fierce gust of wind swayed foliage overhead sent smoke have before risen quietly upwards whirling round recess then for moment be quiet again then came stronger gust rising gathering in power laden with fine particle of snow thick darkness fell harry threw more wood on fire to make blaze loud a be gale outside air in shelter be hardly moved there be slight rustling of leaf overhead thicker thicker flew snow flake in air outside yet none seemed to fall through leaf be dog goned if can make out sam hick said be a quiet here a if be in stone house one must think there be copper plated roof overhead seem nat'ral others be also looking up with air of puzzled surprise not unmingled with uneasiness harry went to entrance looked out over breastwork of bush look here sam said why harry look to a if be snowing up instead of down miner said a joined be just see be in elbow of valley be looking straight down into eye of wind come rushing up valley meet steep wall on way pushed on by wind behind have to go somewhere so be driven almost straight up here over hilltop behind so see snow be carried up instead of falling rock outside shoot clear up over path be following above a long a wind keep north reckon sha' be troubled by snow in here explanation seemed satisfactory there be general feeling of relief remember reading tom said a others took seat again that people can stand on edge of cliff facing gale without feeling wind for wind strike cliff rush up with such force that form sort of wall of course soon beat down again not many yard back can feel gale a strongly a anywhere else just at edge air be perfectly still miner looked at tom a if thought that be making joke at expense uncle said yes can quite believe that see be something like waterfall can stand right under for force shoot outwards reckon be same sort of thing here chief nodded gravely too have be surprised at lull in shelter when storm be raging so furiously outside harry illustration of action of rushing water enlightened more than first explanation have done water ai wind harry ben said be like water in many way ben see can feel just same if stand behind tree round corner rush past be in sort of eddy just a must be if be river be moving alongside of wind act just same way a water if have be big river coming along valley at same rate a wind must rush up rock distance then sweep round race up valley wind being light instead of being heavy be able to rush straight up hill till get right over crest waal if say be all right suppose be anyhow be good thing for care how long go on in same way reckoned that before morning must have branch breaking down on with weight of snow now see be like to have quiet night wo answer for ben be early in day yet there be saying how wind may be blowing before to morrow morning anyhow now have time may a well get of bundle of bush that brought down pile so a to thicken shelter of bush lighten bit if do hang couple of blanket inside of will give good shelter even if wind work round will help to keep warm for though have got wind snow in here have got cold bet jerry agreed be regular blizzard although say a be too cold sitting here by fire wo cost anything to make place bit warmer accordingly bundle of wood have gathered be brought out with screen of bush be thickened raised to height of five foot when be hung inside with couple of blanket be agreed that must get through storm comfortably even if lasted for month cooked last chunk of deer flesh after having first prepared bread put in baking pot among ember made tea from water in skin when have eaten meal covered up in buffalo robe blanket lighted pipe there be however little talk for noise of tempest be so great that be necessary to raise voice almost to shout to be heard be not long before be asleep for hour there be stir in shelter save when horse pawed ground impatiently when hunting dog rose two three time to put fresh stick on fire seemed to tom when woke that ought to be nearly morning took out watch by light of fire made out to surprise that be ten o'clock turmoil of wind seemed to to be a loud a before pulled blanket over shoulder again be soon sound asleep when next woke be with sensation of coldness in face sitting up saw that blanket ground be covered with thick coating of fine snow there be faint light in addition to given by ember of fire knew that morning be breaking movement disturbed uncle who be lying next sat up at once aroused others wake up mate said have have somewhere about eighteen hour sleep day be breaking in minute be astir snow be first shaken off blanket then harry taking shovel cleared floor jerry took largest cooking pot saying to tom bring horse bucket along pushed way out through small gap have be left in screen of bush wind have gone down good deal though be still blowing strongly snow have drifted against entrance formed steep bank there from filled pot bucket pressing snow down tom be glad to get back again within shelter for cold outside be intense fire be already burning brightly pot frying pan be placed over kept replenished with snow a fast a content melted must keep on at harry said there be not drop left in skin horse must have water a soon a enough have melted be poured into kettle there be bacon among trapper store a have calculated that must not be able to hunt until out of big wind valley far up among forest beyond frying pan be now utilized for proper work while pail be placed close enough to fire to thaw content without risking injury to within hour of breakfast being finished enough snow have be thawed to give horse bucket of water in pail couple of pound of flour have be stirred to help out what nourishment must be obtained from leaf from small modicum of grass given to animal will be big journey over pas anyhow harry have said now that be making track for settlement need not be sparing of flour indeed lighter be better day did not pas so pleasantly a preceding for air be filled with fine snow blew in at entrance found way between leaf overhead while from time to time snow accumulating there came down with crash calling forth much strong language from man on whom happened to fall shout of laughter from comrade party be indeed merry one have failed altogether in object of expedition have escaped without scratch from indian have inflicted damage upon luck in finding so snug shelter in such storm far more than counterbalanced disappointment at failure have often be caught in snow uncle bet tom chief here be mighty nigh rubbed out three year ago be prospecting among ute hill while leaping horse be doing hunting for be in middle of winter snow be deep on ground in valley on top of hill there be plenty of bare rock on hillside so be able to go on with work while a for hunting

agreed that must travel good way apart though keeping other in sight must have noticed that trail be single if came upon two together going straight away from camp must know for sure be making off may think that with so many track a have made in fortnight have be there must not have idea be made first day be made last ai so in first place snow be packed hard footprint be very slight then even when be always freezing there be evaporation of snow footprint must gradually disappear besides that wind on most day have be blowing little though drift doe not count for much on packed snow fine dust be blown along if print get altogether covered there be enough drift in to show be old one be fresh knew that must not make much mistake about that must be pretty sure to hit on trail have made in morning when went out on of chief to rock following mine back to same place must guess that have cached there till be dark must have done one can read such trail a like printed book worst of be there be getting out of valley without leaving sign on bare hillside among rock must travel safe enough above be everywhere snow do what must there must be hiding trail agreed that only thing be to cross snow a quick a possible to keep on bare rock whenever got chance wherever struck wood to double sometimes one way sometimes so a to give red skin plenty of work to do to follow trail walked that night right on next day till early in afternoon then lay down slept till sunset then walked again all night did not see game if have must have shot for knew red skin must be long way behind when stopped in morning be not so very far from camp have started from for if have pushed straight back to settlement must have be caught sure for ute must have be certain to have sent off party way to watch valley must have have to pas through lay down among tree slept for few hour then set out to hunt for have be two day without food be beginning to feel must have meal have not gone far when came across track of black bear felt certain that trail be not many hour old followed for two mile found went up to slide of rock have come down from cliff year before for there be bush growing among a rule black bear will always leave alone if leave have much fight in at best so up went thinking be sure of bear steak without much trouble in getting be ahead have just climbed up on to big rock when from bush in

fire by side of put store of wood within reach few pound of bear flesh will keep off a long a can with rifle then there will be five shot with colt will keep last barrel for ai going to let ute amuse by torturing for few hour before finish then make straight away for settlement wo be so hot after when have once got next time go near denver can go tell pete hoskings how came about ' bey white brother be weak with pain ' chief said quietly 'he be talking foolishly know that leaping horse will stay with friend will go look for place without listening to what have to say took up rifle went up valley be steep one be away better than hour then came back 'leaping horse found place said 'where brother can make good fight straight harry get on friend back ' be clear that there be no use talking to lifted up on to foot then got well up on to back a if have be sack of coal went off with striding along pretty near a quick a if have not be there might have be mile when turned up narrow ravine be little more than cleft in rock rose almost straight up from valley did not go in very far for there have be slide be blocked up by pile of rock earth forty fifty foot high be big job even for chief to get up to top of snow have drifted down thick into ravine be nasty place to climb even for man who have got nothing rifle on shoulder however got up safely laid down just over crest have put buffalo robe over shoulder before starting rolled up in said 'leaping horse will go fetch rifle bear meat set straight off left there by chapter ix bad time even to harry went on after refilling lighting pipe did not seem long before chief be back brought heavy load for besides rifle bear flesh carried on back big faggot of brushwood after laying down searched among rock presently set to work to dig out snow earth between two big block be not long before scooped out with tomahawk hole big enough for two of to lie in comfortably laid bear skin down in then carried to helped in then put robe over snugger place must not want to lie in be about ten foot below level of crest of heap of rock of course on upper side so directly red skin made appearance must help up to top that two of must keep ute back did not doubt have rifle chief carried revolver a well a did after have once caught glimpse of sort of place be on did not think must venture into ravine for must have lost dozen men before got to mound have looked round while chief be away saw that hundred yard so higher up ravine came to end side closing in so there be fear of being attacked from there what be afraid of be that indian might be able to get up above shoot down on though whether must not depended on nature of ground above of course must not see beyond edge of rock even if must not get up in daylight must crawl up at night finish must camp down at mouth of ravine starve out for there be chance of climbing side even if leg have be all right be mighty sorry for chief have just thrown life away must come to same in end a far a be concerned even now must get away if chose knew well enough be good talking to so lay there just listening for crack of rifle above must bring down first man came in sartin there must be plenty of time after to get up beside for must be sure to have long talk before made move did not expect until late in afternoon hoped might be getting dark before got down into valley there have be big wind sweeping down since snow have fallen though have drifted deep along side bottom be for most part bare noticed that chief have picked way carefully guessed that a must have reason for thinking be near might not take up trail till morning of course must find fire dead bear that there be left of must fancy have only stopped to take meal have gone on again must see by fire that have left pretty early in day heard nothing of chief until began to get dark then came down to 'leaping horse will go out scout ' said 'if ute not come soon will come back here if come will watch down at mouth of valley till see ute go to sleep ' chief ' said 'at rate may a well take robe one be enough to sleep with in hole will be a snug a beaver wrapped up in mine half hunting shirt be gone will find mighty cold standing out there ' in hour came back again 'utes come ' said 'have just lighted fire going to cook come tonight leaping horse have good news for brother there be star be good news indeed said 'if doe come on to snow to night may carry scalp back to settlement yet 'leaping horse can feel snow in air said 'if snow before morning good if not ute will tell child how many life scalp of englishman seneca cost ' chief lay down beside did not get much sleep for leg be hurting mightily from time to time crawled out time returned saying 'no snow have begun to fear that when came must be too late must not have be long before daybreak when said a crawled in 'the great manitou have sent snow brother can sleep in peace ' hour later raised up bit looked out be light now air be full of fine snow earth chief have scraped out be already covered thickly must see a much a though chief have when came in for last time drawn faggot in after wondered at time why did saw now a soon a snow have fallen little more must hide up altogether entrance to hole hour after hour passed became impossible to get even peep out for snow have fallen so thickly on leafy end of brushwood be outward that have entirely shut in day snow kept on a must tell from lessening light by two o'clock only faint twilight made way in 'how long do think will be imprisoned here chief ' asked beust not hurry ' replied 'there be tree up valley ute may make camp there stay till storm be over use to go out till brother can walk wait till snow be over then stay two three day to give time for ute to go away got bear flesh to eat warm in here melt snow ' be true enough for be feeling downright hot just before night came on chief pushed end of ramrod through snow looked out along hole very strong ' said 'when be dark can go out if wish there be not much to tell about next five day snow kept falling steadily evening after dark chief went outside for short time to smoke pipe while sat at entrance smoked mine be glad enough to get little fresh air a soon a came in again faggot be drawn back to place be imprisoned for twenty four hour one get pretty tired after time of eating raw bear flesh drinking snow water bet be pretty glad when chief after looking out through peephole said that snow have stopped falling sun be shining about middle of day said suddenly ' hear voice be time before heard anything

particular motive wur just out of cussedness be not going to be bluffed from going whar chose air free country have a much right to go up valley a have must have thought yer have have more common sense sam hick jerry said reproachfully than to go mixing up in business in have sort of consarn ef one of woman have asked to help if have thought be being taken away agin will other man must have have right to take hand in game a be war just fooling with life to interfere with mormon in own country be so jerry ai word to say agin war just piece of cussedness have asked forty eleven time since what on arth made make such blame fool of afore that fellow came over to bluff have no thought of following waggon arter felt somehow a if dared to do reckoned be more match for two fellow who just jined a for greasy faced chap in black did not count in one way other have thought of getting gal away of getting into mus with if left alone be just that have got right to go up valley other be not going to be bluffed out of so took up shooting iron strapped blanket over shoulder started war maybe mile away when turned into valley be hungry for fight so did keep up middle just skirted along at foot of hill where did not seem likely a must see did not get closer to only caught sight of now then a far a must make out there be only one horseman with reckoned other be gone on ahead looking for camping ground maybe going on to one of mormon farm to tell to get thing ready there what reckoned on doing so far a reckoned at be to scout up to a soon a got dark listen to talk try to find out for certain whether woman war goin ' willing then thought a must walk straight up to fire just bluff four men a tried to bluff waal went on until late in afternoon unhitched cattle camped waited for bit now that war cooled down must look at thing reasonable allowed to myself have showed up a blamed fool have pretty well made up mind to take back track go down valley when sound of horse coming down fast from camp then thought be 'tarnal fool came to pretty strong bet one of fellow have ridden on brought down of regulator a used to call in mining camp believe mormon call destroying angel though there be mighty little of angel about hoped now that have not caught sight of during day that band be going right down to waggon camp a have not taken particular pain to hide reckoned must have made out war pretty nigh dark a took cover behind bush must scarce see a rode along went down about two hundred yard then stopped must hear of dismount 'you be sure be far enough ' one said 'yes can swear be higher up than when saw just before camped ' 'if two fellow have be worst kind of cur ' man said angrily 'you must have hidden up a soon a made out be following shot a came along ' told ' voice said 'that man be indian fighter dead shot suppose have missed ' 'you must not have missed if have waited till be close to before fired then might have chucked in among bush there must have be end of must have be saved twenty mile ride now then look sharp for search bush between johnson party above be sure to catch ' did see that though did wish rock behind have not be so 'tarnal steep must have made way up in daylight though even then must have be tough job without light enough to see lay of ledge best place for getting from one to be business did care about be just thinking of making across to other side of valley when horseman came galloping back 'you stop here brother ephraim keep ear well open a well a eye stop fifty yard higher up hiram others at same distance apart when men among rock come abreast of ephraim ride on take place at other end of line do same hiram so all in turn will ride up down ' be clear meant business be doubting whether must take chance of hiding make for cliff when saw light coming dancing down from camp knew be chap on horseback with torch a came up man who have spoken before said 'how many torch have got brother williams ' ' dozen of ' 'give six take other six down to men below be right will light one from yours may guess that settled have got to git at once so began to crawl off towards foot of cliff by time have got there there war six torch burning hundred yard below men who carried be searching bush prying under rock along middle of valley six other torch be burning fifty yard apart there be one advantage torch be pitch pine gave fairish light not so much a tarred rope must have done be enough for to be able to make out face of cliff saw break by must get up for good bit anyhow be where torrent came down when snow be melting a soon a have got to bottom made straight up there be rock piled at foot got to top of without being seen have got dozen foot higher when foot set boulder rolling down went with crash there be shout below did not stop to listen to what said put up bed of torrent at two forty gait shot rang out be getting now above light of torch hundred foot higher came to stand still for rock rose right up in front of water have here come down from above in fall made tight place bet there war ledge a must see must get along must have to go down good bit afore got to one kept on firing from below felt pretty sure that must not see for must hear bullet striking high against face of rock have stopped may bet be careful how went down again took time for must see that men with torch have halted at foot of heap of rock below not caring much expect to begin to mount while horseman kept on firing hoping to hear body come rolling down besides must have known that with torch made pretty sure mark for at last got down to ledge war narrow one for few yard have to walk with face to rock arm spread out that when knew that at moment might make out bullet come singing up war by mean pleasant in few yard ledge got wider there be room enough on for to lie down crawled along for good bit then sat down with back against rock reckoned matter up torch war gathered round where have gone up four more men have come down from camp on horseback five six on foot with torch be running down valley have be searching for among bush higher up when heard firing have started down to jine others leader be shouting to men to climb up after men did seem to see be use heard one fellow say must be chock full of bullet long ago will go up find carcass in morning ' suppose be not dead fool ' 'well if ai dead must just pick off one after a went up with torch 'well put torch out then here will go first if be afraid jumped from horse can bet boot that finger itched to put bullet into war to be done did not know how far ledge went whether there might be way of getting off now have once got out of sight must have be chucking away life to let know whar lay so got up again walked on bit farther came on place where rock have crumbled enough for to be able to get up on to next ledge after lot of climbing up down got to top in about two hour then struck across hill came down at eight o'clock next morning on to caravan track hid up till evening in case must come down after next morning came up to caravan just a be hitching team up for start got out of better than deserved harry said must have believed that man must have played fool trick a to go meddling with mormon in own country without kind of reason war worse than childishness other two miner assented vigorously sam said waal ca think more meanly of over business than do of have never be able to make out why did may bet ai often tell story war dog goned piece of foolishness a harry say did desarve to get out of a did still ai made feel kind of love for mormon when about two hundred shot have be fired at man make feel kinder like a if war going to pay of back when get chance may bet mean to jee rusalem exclamation be elicited by fall of heavy mass of snow on to fire over kettle have just begun to boil tripod from hung be knocked over cloud of steam filled place party sprung to foot to avoid being scalded might have waited few minute longer jerry grumbled then must have have tea comfortable now fire be out water be spilt have got to fetch in more snow be last lot there be melted be in day work jerry harry said cheerfully be just a well must have something to do will fetch snow in if rest of will clear hearth again be nuisance about snow agreed that there be help for may thank star be worse be not long before fire be blazing again took time before water be boiling tea made still longer before bread have be soddened by water from kettle be fit to eat by time be dark when meal be over turned in for night tom be just going off to sleep when be roused by leaping dog suddenly throwing off buffalo robe springing to foot with rifle in hand hist said in low tone something come men seized rifle listened intently presently heard soft step on snow outside then there be snuffing sound b'ar indian said moment later great head reared over bush at entrance five rifle rang out two indian reserving fire report be followed by dull sound of heavy fall outside wait moment harry said sharply a others be preparing to rush out let make sure be dead be dead enough jerry said reckon even grizzly can not walk off with five bullet in head harry looked over screen yes be dead enough anyhow look so waal be piece of luck stepped out on to platform be grizzly uncle tom asked excitedly be grizzly sure enough want to see colour to know look at size why be a big a cow ay lad big cow too go in make up fire while cut off enough meat for supper fact that have eaten meal hour before went for nothing slice of bear meat be soon frizzling a hearty meal be eaten a if food have be tasted since previous day men be in highest spirit fact that be out of meat have be greatest drawback to prospect of being shut up for perhaps week for badly baked bread be poor diet to men accustomed to live almost exclusively upon meat what brought bear down here tom asked curiosity at first perhaps then hunger uncle replied expect be going along on path above when saw light among leaf then doubt smelt bread perhaps horse came down to see what must get curiosity be bad fault tom have have two lesson in evening bear in mind that in part of world safest plan be always to attend strictly to own business thought of sleep be for present dissipated pipe be again lighted be midnight before lay down in morning bear be with difficulty skinned cut up joint being left outside to freeze through snow still fell steadily wind have almost died down sallying out cut five six long pole with difficulty fixed from above across from cliff to outstanding rock pushed bear skin across lashed there bulk being sufficient to cover space above fire considerable portion of dwelling room after breakfast snow be again melted for horse work for day thus done seated contentedly round fire chapter x avalanche think chief harry asked that there be chance of 'rappahoes taking into head to come up to have look round indian keep in lodge like cold think have gone on over pas if weather get fine perhaps come to look for gun pack think sure die in snow storm when up in pas when snow stop falling make more fire path from valley shut up by snow now yes think anyone must try to climb till sun have cleared track be pretty bad place when came up harry said say that men on foot must not make way up a say red skin be not likely to try until weather have cleared bit though say that must if knew be camped here close to top what noise be that tom asked have heard several time before not so loud a snow slide leaping horse said snow come down from mountain break off tree roll rock down bad place along here yes saw that looked up at hill behind there before looked over edge here chief ben gulston said reckoned that have snow slide in mind thought that be like enough snow might come tumbling over edge of high wall then come scooting down over where war there must have be sort of show for if have be camped whar trail go along leaping horse have heard from red brother with whom have spoken that trail from top of valley very bad when snow fall many indian stopping too long at fort to trade good have be swept away by snow slide when caught in storm here thought looked bad place harry remarked there ai fooling with snow slide anyway have come across bone once twice lying scattered about in snug looking valley bone of horse men be easy to see have be killed by snow slide coming down on rock be heaped about among of bone be smashed have be hunting trapping sheltered up in valley when storm came on slide have fallen on there have laid till sun melted snow in summer when coyote vulture must soon clean bone broke off suddenly there be dull sound at same moment distinct vibration of ground then rustling murmur mingled with rumbling a of waggon passing over rocky ground there be one jerry exclaimed be somewhere just above keep back to wall boy illustration there be avalanche keep back to wall boy louder louder grew sound tremor of earth increased horse neighed with fright men stood with back against rock next to hill suddenly light be darkened a vast mass of snow mingled with rock of size leapt like torrent over edge of cliff impetus carrying over outer wall of shelter down into ravine there be mighty sound of crashing of tree mingled with thumping rolling of rock a clashed against side of ravine went leaping down into valley ground shook with continuous tremor then light returned a suddenly a have be cut off few second later dead stillness succeeded deafening roar from below passage of avalanche overhead have lasted minute though to men standing below time have seemed vastly longer instinctively have pressed against rock almost holding breath expecting momentarily that one of boulder in passage must strike top of outside wall fall in fragment among silence followed be unbroken for second then sam hick stepped pace forward jee rusalem said that be close call know how felt boy seemed a if sand have gone out of weakened so that knee have not done shaking yet men accustomed a be to danger be equally affected tom felt relieved to see that others looked pale shaken for be conscious that have be in terrible fright that leg must scarcely support weight be glad to hear say so sam for be in awful funk must not have said so if have spoken need be ashamed of tom uncle put in showed plenty of pluck when be in trouble with red skin be sure there be not one of did not weaken when snow slide shot over none of need be ashamed to say so man with good grit will brace up keep head cool finger steady on trigger to last though know that have come to end of journey have got to go down be when there be nothing to do fight to be made when be a helpless a child have sort of show that grit run out of boot have fought red skin mexican score of time have be in dozen shooting scrape in saloon at digging know that ever felt so scared a did just now ben there be jar of whisky in outfit agreed must not touch unless one of got hurt ill think drop of medicine round now must be out of place there be general assent before take went on will take off hat say 'thank god ' for having taken safe through thing if have put shelter here for express must not have planted better for least can do be to thank for having pulled through safe men took off hat stood silent for minute two with bent head when have replaced hat ben gulston went to corner where pack saddle pack be piled took out small keg poured out whisky for of white men others drank straight tom mixed water with felt good deal better after drinking ben did not offer to indian of whom must touch spirit on occasion be good friend bad enemy harry said a tossed off portion a rule there ai doubt that one be better without there be better medicine to carry about with have seen many life saved by bottle of whisky taken after bite of rattlesnake be a good thing a there be in case of fever when man be just tired out after twenty four hour tramp drop of will put new life into for bit say a have killed sight more than have cured be at bottom of pretty nigh shooting scrape in camp have be ruin of hundred of good men who must have done well if must have kept from ai temperance man harry sam then thank god be master of liquor not liquor of can take glass perhaps two without wanting more though have made fool of in many way since have come out here man can say ever saw drunk if liquor be to get better of once must swear off for rest of life ever take to tom be not to get so a to like to go on drinking in life often have to go for month without man have got to be very careful when go down to settlement else must be sure to get over care for at uncle see get to care for tom there be plenty start a do before have be out here long do get to like from day be never good be big temptation man have be hunting trapping fossicking for gold in hill for month come down to fort town meet lot of mate one say 'have drink asks be mighty hard to be always saying 'no there ai much to do in place to drink to gamble man here ai so much to be blamed a folk who live in comfortable house have got wife family decent place of amusement book sort of thing if take to drink gambling have not right to preach for if drink do gamble be have done though swore off that when got letter telling that father have gone then thought what fool have made of for year why if have kept gold have dug must go home now live comfortably for rest of life have home for niece a ought to have however have done with now be mighty glad be card not drink that took dust for be great deal easier to give up card than be to give up liquor when have once taken to now let talk of something else vote take turn up on to trail see what snow slide have done throwing buffalo robe round shoulder party went outside air be too thick with snow to enable to perceive from platform destruction have wrought in valley below upon ascending path to level above track of avalanche be plainly marked indeed for width of hundred yard white mantle of snow covered slope up to point where wall of cliff rose abruptly have be cleared away a if with mighty broom rock boulder lying upon have be swept off surface of bare rock lay flat unbroken by even tuft of grass walked along edge until looked down upon shelter bear hide be still in place sloping like pent house roof from upper side two three inch below edge of rock to other wall three foot lower be however stripped of hair a cleanly a if have be shorn off with razor by friction of snow have shot down along be blamedest odd thing ever saw sam hick said wonder weight of snow did break in expect just shot over sam harry said must have be travelling so mighty fast that whole mass jumped across only just rubbing skin of course boulder stone must have gone clean over show what narrow escape have have for if outer rock have be foot so higher skin must have caved in place must have be filled chock up with snow in moment waal may a well turn in again for feel cold to bone already on evening of fifth day snow ceased falling next morning sky be clear bright preparation be at once made for start batch of bread have be baked on previous evening bucket of hot gruel be given to horse meal be hastily eaten horse saddled pack arranged before sun have be up hour be on way usual stillness of mountain be broken by variety of sound from valley at foot came up sharp report a limb of tree sometimes tree broke beneath weight of snow dull rumbling sound echoing from hill to hill told of fall of avalanche scarcely have echo of one ceased than began again in fresh quarter journey be toilsome in extreme for horse hoof sank deep in freshly fallen snow rendering progress exceedingly slow if have be sure that weather must hold chief must have be better to have waited few day before making start for by time snow must have be hard enough to travel on chief shook head winter coming for good said waving hand towards range of snowy summit to north cloud there still if stop not able to cross pas till next summer be so agreed a to yesterday that if get over now chance be will never get over at yet be pity ca wait few day for crust to form on snow twice in course of next hour avalanche came down from hill above first sweeping down into valley quarter of mile behind next two three hundred yard ahead of scarcely word be spoken from end to end of line travelled in indian file horse stepped in footprint of predecessor few hundred yard changed place for labour of first horse be very much heavier than of following at end of hour men drew together for consultation there be wide break in line of cliff valley ran nearly due south what do think chief confounded snow have covered up sign of trail have got to find own way there be doubt valley below be running deal too much to west that trail must strike off somewhere south look to a if be likely valley through cliff there be hiding fact that if take wrong turn be gone coon leaping horse know more than brother chief said gravely know pas be on western side of great peak great peak lie there pointed little to west of break in hill up be looking may be that must cross hill into valley perhaps will turn west presently tell what harry sam hick said opinion be that best plan by long chalk will be to go back to last place to stop there for bit have got b'ar flesh enough for fortnight may kill more game afore be done ef be spell of snow may melt enough in ten day for to make out trail follow ef a chief think have got winter right down on must wait till snow crust hardens ef be month double anything be better than going on like what with soft snow 'tarnal snow slide there ai no more chance of getting over pas in one day journey than there air in flying right down to salt lake city ef worst come to worst tell yer must rather go back take chance of following big wind river down fighting red skin than must of crossing over dog goned hill other three men be of same opinion well what do say chief harry asked indian leaping horse think that trail will not be found until next summer chief replied quietly heap of hill in front heap of snow if snow storm catch in hill find way anywhere leaping horse be ready to do whatever white brother think well be with others harry said like look of cloud be quiet enough now may begin to shift time a say if be caught in snow storm on hill there be end of think sam be right even if have to rustle through winter in hut there must rather face than keep on settled horse head be turned retraced step until reached shelter bear skin have be left where be fire be soon set going there be general feeling of satisfaction a laid out robe blanket again look here boy harry said be not going to be holiday time bet have got to make place sight snugger than be now for tell when winter set in in earnest will be cold enough here to freeze buffalo solid in hour have got to set to work to make roof over place have got to hunt to lay in big stock of meat have got to get big store of food for horse for must be mighty careful with flour now can wait fortnight to see how thing go if be clear then that have got to fight out here through winter must shoot pack pony at once reckon others will have to go later however will give chance a long a can take down into valley chief said indian horse ah did think of chief yes be accustomed to rustle for living may make shift to hold on down there think there be much fear of indian coming up indian leaping horse said indian go away when winter set in go to forest go to lodge right down valley stop up here in mountain when winter come plenty game big horn wapiti ah be more cheerful look out chief if can get plenty of meat can manage without flour can go down give pony pail of hot gruel once week will help to keep life together first thing take be to cut pole for roof be afraid will have to go down to bottom for waal need begin till to morrow sam hick said if have have got skin to cover cut brushwood indian said first put plenty of brushwood on pole then put skin over yes be plan chief well if get down there will have to take shovel clear snow off of narrow ledge if do that can lead one of horse down to pack pole up here chief went out on to platform use clear snow now cloud moving in two hour snow fall again others joined outside reckon be right chief jerry said be mighty lucky did go on ca be much worse here than be before at three in afternoon began to snow heavily again there be le wind than there have be on previous occasion snow drifted through entrance le than before just a be turning in for night ominous crack be heard above leapt from blanket looking up must see by light of fire that pole supporting skin be bent in curve downwards jee rusalem sam hick exclaimed whole outfit will be coming down on that will sam see there be wind a there be before one of job will be keeping roof clear of snow turn out boy must get rid of somehow at once set to work to lash two pole eight foot long to handle of shovel a soon a be done turned out on reaching edge of ravine above roof first cleared away snow down to rock so a to have firm standing then proceeded to shovel snow off surface of skin be easier work than expected for a soon a be touched slid down incline in very few minute whole be cleared off think be good until morning now harry said a long a snow last will have to do few hour directly get spell of fine weather must put more pole under to strengthen for six day snow continued to fall without intermission at daybreak at mid day last thing before turned in at night snow be cleared off hide with exception did not stir out of shelter have also day to clear out inner portion of fissure a snow now frequently broke through tree in mass startling horse keeping in state of restlessness sixth day stopped snowing next morning sky be bright clear whole party at once started out two of taking shovel rest broom that have made during long hour of confinement by middle of day have cleared path down into valley on way back to dinner carried up large bundle of faggot meal be cooked eaten hastily whole of horse be then led down into valley here couple of dozen stout pole for roof be cut by white two indian at once going up valley in search of game in hour two rifle shot be heard presently hunting dog ran in with news that have killed two wapiti jerry sam hick at once went off with leading two horse presently returned with dead deer fastened across back be very like picture have seen of moose tom said to uncle a examined great stag new comer often call moose tom there be difference between though what difference be can not tell for have never hunted moose believe wapiti be peculiar to west often go in great herd of three four hundred together chief say there be great many of up valley jerry put in made off when fired must see foot track about say have be driven down here by storm for shelter have gone round with lad to head back be good news jerry meat have got already will last time be a well to lay in good stock want skin badly to make roof have better lead horse to foot of path then will take post behind tree across valley hour later heard report of two rifle long way up valley stood in readiness few minute later there be dull trampling sound almost directly afterwards herd of wapiti came along at heavy trot ploughing way slowly through snow use revolver boy harry have said except to finish off stag have wounded with rifle chance be against bringing down poor brute must only get away to die one after rifle rang out tom uncle have satisfaction of seeing stag have aimed at plunge forward before have gone many yard farther roll over dead other three have hit animal aimed at a kept on course dashed out in pursuit firing colt in hand be a deadly weapon a rifle three stag fell although one got nearly mile down valley before succumbed carcass be hoisted on to of horse back loaded animal be then led up track will wait until indian come back uncle tell why have gone up there be occasion for tom must hear shot will have guessed have happened pole be divided among men carried up to top of path laid down just above shelter harry sam hick at once proceeded to cut up into proper length while others skinned cut up deer number of thong be cut from one of hide for lashing cross pole across be to act a ridge pole bear skin be removed additional pole placed at spot working together framework of roof be completed by indian have returned soon after party began work taking horse down fetched up deer have killed in morning roof be completed hide being stretched over framework securely lashed to with thong whole of tree brushwood be then chopped down close to ground so a to leave level floor foliage be given to horse wood cut up piled for fuel chief reported that at upper end of valley there be thick pine wood must give good shelter to horse near be plenty of bush level tract have be beaver meadow be thickly covered with grass a must see where wapiti have scratched away snow to get at be excellent news for question of how horse must be fed through winter have troubled much more than of own maintenance joint of venison be hung up on pole outside what now called hut one two ham being suspended from rafter over fire to be smoked will have to rig up b'ar trap outside ben said will be having here after meat b'ar ham now then will make change wapiti flesh ai bad must get dog goned tired of arter bit may bet will ben jerry agreed reckon that will be able to get lot of game through winter valley down there be just place for to shelter in hope will get big horn now then will be difficult thing to make b'ar trap outside grizzly want pretty strong pen to keep in though horse might drag up big beam from below there ai fastening in rock think can make sort of trap harry said must contrive something else need not do work at once have got plenty of time before want three four more skin to finish hut mean to fill up entrance yes will sew together make curtain to hang from edge of roof to ground tell be going to be mighty cold here besides will keep snow from drifting in wish to goodness must make chimney tom said smoke went up through leaf right eye be watering now if fill up end with skin will be something awful will get accustomed to tom of course must make hole at top when fill up entrance what do think be next thing to be done chief get wood chief said emphatically must fill end of hut with wood will

morrow morning chief agree with sooner better accordingly next morning went down to valley have two ax jerry sam hick who have done good deal of wood cutting undertook portion of work others took horse up to beaver meadow where at once began scraping at snow be soon munching away at rich grass why do call beaver meadow uncle see beaver have gone long ago perhaps hundred year a know valley be occupied by indian in summer must soon clear out beaver be called beaver meadow because be made by set to work dammed up stream gradually flat became lake well in time know leaf from wood above soil dead wood other thing brought down by stream gradually filled up bottom then beaver be killed dam went to ruin water drained off in short time grass began to grow there be hundred ay thousand of beaver meadow among hill on little stream run into big river nowhere be grass so rich will often see indian village by one of meadow grow root plant corn there horse will do first rate here through winter if snow get too deep for anyhow can help out with bucket of gruel occasionally will be awfully cold for though will be coldish doubt indian pony be accustomed to must think uncle must not take much trouble to make sort of shed up among tree there sam laughed even chief smiled must not be bad plan tom uncle said not so much for sake of warmth though there be doubt that warmer be le can do with to eat if have place to go to be le likely to wander away will not have trouble of hunting for well will think over following valley up found that extended ten mile farther for last two of be narrow canyon few yard wide shot black bear four small deer returned carrying skin hind quarter of deer bear ham seem to have got meat enough for anything tom remonstrated when shot deer seven men will get through lot of meat tom when have nothing else to go with may be week before can put head out of hut besides skin will be useful will want deer skin shirt trouser sock cap skin of deer be softer more pliable than of wapiti want to kill more than can help lad for hate taking life without there be necessity for can do with lot more skin before be stocked when driving horse before returned to woodcutter found have cut down chopped into log number of tree tom be quite astonished at great pile of firewood have be got ready by in course of day work log be made up into bundle weighing about eighty pound be tied together with horse lariat then secured one on side of saddle two of horse carrying meat harry took bridle of horse started up path others following at once be good day work harry said a log be piled at inner end of hut be about ton of wood if have week of open weather will have good store in cellar work continued steadily for week horse be day taken to feed at meadow two wood chopper continued work while rest of party hunted indian have on second day gone down valley returned with report that indian lodge have disappeared that valley be entirely deserted eight more wapiti be killed during week fourteen smaller deer of evening occupied in sewing skin together with thong of leather hole being made with knife curtain at mouth of hut be completed hung four wide slab of wood have be cut have be bound together with thong so a to form sort of chimney four foot high with good deal of difficulty be secured by prop in position over hole cut through skin above fire first avalanche will carry away tom yes uncle have have one avalanche here seems to chance be strongly against having in exactly same place skin of smaller deer be carefully scraped with knife on inner side smeared with bear fat then rubbed kneaded until be perfectly soft chapter xi winter erection of tom shed for horse did not take long whole party with exception of two indian who a usual went hunting proceeded to pine wood above beaver meadow after little search six tree be found conveniently situated with regard to other axemen cut down three young fir one be lashed by others between two central tree to form ridge pole eight foot from ground others against other tree at height of three foot to support lower end of roof be ten foot apart so that roof might have considerable pitch number of other young tree be felled fixed six inch apart from ridge down to eaves on branch of young fir tree be thickly laid light pole be lashed lengthways over to keep in place a pole of roof have be cut long enough to extend down to ground side wall be necessary end be formed of pole lashed across to side tree extending down only to within four foot six of ground so a to allow horse to pas under be like roof thickly covered with bough lower end be left open for width of four foot in middle upright being driven into ground side completed a before what do want doorway at end for tom asked must have be easier quicker to have shut one end up altogether must be good deal so must tom if grizzly be to appear at door must horse do must be caught in trap do think be likely to come uncle likeliest thing in world tom horse can smell bear good distance off if heard one coming down going up valley must bolt through opposite door will do first rate here will stand pretty close together warmth of body will heat place up wo know will be so comfortable have only taken day work to make shed though laughed at idea at first think now that day have be well spent in getting up such good shelter jerry have got big pail boiling over fire will put in few handful of flour brought down bring horse in from meadow will give drink of gruel in shed will soon learn that be to be home for two more day open weather continued horse took up three load of wood afternoon a have done previous week then a there be sign of change be given good feed at shed saddle be taken off hung up on cross pole over head party have scarcely returned to hut when snow began to fall be however weather proof felt immense additional comfort of change have made stock of firewood be now very large one at journey horse have brought up about fifteen hundredweight a work have gone on for nine day have calculated something like fourteen ton of firewood neatly stacked have also stock of pole in case roof must require strengthening certain amount of light found way in at edge of curtain across entrance depended principally upon fire light smoke however be serious grievance even men be forced occasionally to go outside into open air to allay smarting of eye think uncle might do something to dry wood ca see that can do more than be doing tom always keep dozen log lying round fire to dry bit before be put on must think might make sort of stage about four foot above fire keep log up there might pile so that hot air smoke must go up through must dry great deal faster there than merely lying down on ground think idea be very good one tom will have to make frame pretty strong for if happened to come down might break of leg men agreed that idea be capital one after consultation set to to carry out two strong pole be first chosen be cut carefully to right length be jambed between rock at height of seven foot above floor five foot apart be driven in wedged so tightly that must bear weight of two men swinging upon without moving then four upright pole be lashed to five foot apart be connected with cross pole be strong enough for anything jerry said when structure have be so far completed if horse be to run against one of pole must hardly bring thing down four other short pole be now lashed to upright three foot below upper framework be crossed by others so a to form gridiron on log be laid in tier crossing other sufficient space being left between to allow for passage of hot air be splendid contrivance harry said when took seat on buffalo robe round fire looked up admiringly at work log will get a dry a chip in future sha' be bothered with smoke besides will do to stand pail pot full of snow there keep supply of water without putting down into fire running risk of upset have occupation now in manufacturing suit of clothes piece from deer skin a work required to be neater than sufficed for making of curtain pointed stick hardened in fire be used for making hole thong served a thread be cut a finely a possible being done by indian who turned out thicker than pack thread there be occasion for hurry there be much laughing joking over work hunting shirt breech served a pattern from to cut out skin a strove to outvie others garment when completed be very fair specimen of work hunting shirt be made with hood when pulled over head covered whole face except eye nose mouth a have plenty of skin hood shirt be made double so that there be hair inside out be made to come down way to knee being kept close at waist by belt legging be made of single thickness only a must be worn over breech be long reached down below ankle indian made fresh moccasin for whole party be made higher than usual so a to come up over bottom of legging in addition be provided with long strip of hide be to be wound round round legging from knee to below ankle covering tightly top of moccasin so preventing snow from finding way in there glove be then manufactured finger being in one thumb only being free work occupied fortnight broken only by one day spell of fine weather utilized by going down into valley taking with kettle pail together with few pound of flour found horse out in meadow a soon a saw came trotting to meet with loud whinny of pleasure fire be lit near shed snow melted allowance of warm gruel given to horse at tom suggestion few fir bough be hung from bar over entrance must swing aside a horse entered must keep out good deal of wind when at end of fortnight sky cleared chief said that thought that there must be little more snow if storm come sure to bring snow not last long winter now set in soon snow harden now make snowshoe hunter have be accustomed to use in winter have found last expedition through deep snow very toilsome one embraced idea eagerly of pole be split into eight foot length be wetted hung over fire process being repeated until wood be sufficiently softened to be bent into required shape be done by chief two cross piece be added to stiffen keep in right shape when dried wood be then trimmed up scraped by men when have dried hardened work of filling up frame with closely stretched network of leather be undertaken part of work occupied three four day strap be attached to go across toe round heel be then ready to set off weather be now intensely cold a there be little wind be not greatly felt at same time be glad of fur when ventured outside hut on first day after snow shoe be finished rest of party started off to visit horse hunting dog remaining behind to give tom instruction in use of snow shoe to help when fell down tom found difficult work at first toe of shoe frequently catching in snow pitching head foremost into must have have great difficulty in extricating have not young indian be at hand before day be over however must get on fairly well after two three more day practice have made such progress that be considered capable of accompanying rest wood drying apparatus have succeeded excellently wood be now dried so thoroughly before being put on to fire that there be annoyance from smoke inside hut scarce must be perceived coming from chimney upon harry remarking upon with satisfaction first time went out after using dry wood tom said what doe matter there be indian in valley be so tom a soon a weather set in clear red skin will be hunting again winter be best time for laying in stock of pelt for trading at other time game be all high up in mountain be very difficult to get within range of in winter animal come down to shelter of forest valley can be shot in number especially a indian in snow shoe can get along almost a quickly a wapiti can plough through snow at present red skin think that must have be overtaken by first storm have gone under a soon a begin to venture out of lodge to hunt column of smoke here must be sure to catch eye then must be having up valley to certainty first thing must do must be to find horse drive off next thing must be to set to work to catch must hold path against uncle yes must have to keep watch day must be serious trouble besides there must be other place must get up doubt regular trail come up here because be straightest way to pas possibly there may be other point at loaded animal must mount anywhere about here there must be plenty of place where indian must climb even if took detour of fifty mile must manage a long a there be smoke may hope will not discover here though hunting party might come upon horse be what have bothered along chief have talked over dozen time can see way of avoiding risk ca keep horse up here because ca feed even if be to bring to leave comfortable place to build hut down in valley might be surprised rubbed out by red skin of course might bring up here night take down again in morning must be troublesome business have agreed that wo do much more shooting down in valley that in coming going to horse will keep along close to foot of cliff side so that if two three indian do come up wo see track on snow unless happen to come close up to cliff of course if go up a far a beaver flat will light upon horse there be help for chief agreed last night that in future two of will always stay up here will take by turn to keep watch wo be necessary to stand outside if curtain be pulled aside three four inch one can see right down valley indian coming up must be made out if party be strong one gun must be fired a signal to away hunting damp wood thrown on fire might possibly push on up valley to have look at place two up here with rifle must soon stop after of course horse must have to be brought up here at night watch kept by night a well a by day two three morning later found on going out that two joint of venison have be carried off footprint in snow showed that have be done by grizzly bear turned attention again to construction of trap have not be thought of since day be first mentioned young tree of four five inch in diameter be cut below brought up butt be cut in shape of wedge be driven strongly into fissure in rock rope with running noose have be fastened to tree be bent down by united strength of four men fixed to catch fastened in ground noose being kept open by two stick placed across foot beyond noose joint of venison be hung rope passing over pole then down to catch so upon joint being pulled catch must be loosened when tree must fly up noose catch anything might be through week later be disturbed by outburst of violent growling seizing rifle rushed out huge bear be caught by one of paw animal weight be too great for to be lifted from ground be standing upright with paw above head making furious effort to free volley of bullet at once put end to life tree be bent down again noose loosed at once returned to rug leaving bear where fell four time during winter did thus capture intruder providing with ample supply of bear flesh while skin must sell well down at settlement otherwise sport be not very good more wapiti came up black white tail deer be occasionally shot five six big horn sheep also fell to rifle one day on approaching beaver meadow chief pointed to deep footprint explanation be needed knew that be made by big grizzly that animal be going up valley horse be in view on flat grasping rifle hurried towards wood just a reached horse came galloping to meet whinnying snorting have be scared by critter jerry said do see coat be staring gosh look at pack pony bear have have paw on animal hind quarter be indeed badly torn wonder how got away harry said when grizzly once get hold often leave go there be something in front of hut tom exclaimed be grizzly sure enough harry said be rum place for to go to sleep advanced holding rifle in readiness to fire when leaping horse said bear dead what can have killed harry asked doubtfully horse kill chief replied hurried up to spot bear be indeed dead there be sign of desperate struggle there be blood on snow from point near door of hut to where animal be lying ten yard away round snow be trampled deeply bear head be battered out of shape jaw be broken one of eye driven out indian examined ground closely well what do make of chief harry asked bear walk round hut come in other end horse not able to get out in time pack horse last bear catch by hind quarter horse drag little way then fall then other horse come back form ring round bear kick look at print of fore foot deep in snow be where kick break bear jaw break rib keep on kick till dead suppose be how came about chief must not have thought must have done seneca nodded when wild horse with young foal attacked by bear mountain lion form circle with colt in middle stand head in kick bear mountain lion afraid to attack waal must hardly have believed if have not seen sam hick said that horse must come back to attack grizzly not come back chief said if not for friend friend cry out loud then horse come back fight bear kill well be mighty plucky of harry said be afraid pony wo get over be terribly torn chief examined horse wound again get over said cold stop wound bleeding get fat put in reckon will find plenty inside grizzly jerry said chief shook head bear fat bad other horse smell perhaps keep away from perhaps kick leaping horse will bring fat from big horn shot yesterday animal lay where have fallen mile up valley went up tied great sheep foot together putting pole through brought down to hut partly skinning obtained fat melted in kettle over fire sam hick have remained behind at fire horse standing near excited at prospect of usual meal a soon a fat be melted be poured into horse wound mess of gruel be then prepared given to animal bear be skinned ham cut off then by united effort be dragged distance from hut carcass of big horn bear flesh hide be afterwards carried up to hut early in february cold reached extreme point in spite of keeping up good fire have long before be compelled to build up entrance with wall of firewood interstice being stuffed with hut be lighted by lamp of bear deer fat melted down poured into tin drinking cup wick being composed of strip of birch bark watch be regularly kept day two always remaining in hut one keeping watch through small slip cut in curtain before narrow orifice in log wall served a door other looking after fire keeping up good supply of melted snow preparing dinner ready for return of hunter at sunset of evening told story stock of yarn of own adventure of have heard from others seemed to tom inexhaustible hunting dog have made rapid advance with english tom have become great friend always hunting together when turn came remaining together on guard cold be now so intense that hunting party be seldom out for more than two three hour regularly twice week horse be given ration of hot gruel although have fallen away greatly in flesh maintained health be capable of work if called upon to do be one day in middle of february that hunting dog who be standing at peep hole exclaimed 'rappahoes tom sprang up from side of fire running to entrance pulled aside curtain looked out six indian on snow shoe be coming up valley ran out on to platform fired ride a sound of report reached indian ear stopped suddenly will throw green wood on fire hunting dog need indian replied others only gone hour not farther than horse hut hear gun plain enough perhaps 'rappahoes go back indian remained for time in consultation not know where gun fired hunting dog said soon see hut then know after time red skin continued way up valley instead of coming on carelessly in centre separated going to other side crept along among fallen boulder there where must have escaped observation have not be for figure showing against white snow must fire now young indian said then leaping horse know 'rappahoes coming up went out on to platform opened fire knew that chance of hitting one of indian be small indeed other side of valley be quarter of mile away height at be standing rendered difficult to judge elevation necessary for rifle however fired a fast a must load indian made reply for gun must not carry anything like distance occasionally gathered when came upon boulder of rock sufficiently large to give shelter to then moved on again one at time when lower end of pathway again held consultation go further hunting dog said afraid come down path stop see leaping horse among rock be time before tom must detect indian so stealthily did move from rock to rock where be others see somewhere in bush leaping horse go on to scout not know how many 'rappahoes presently saw chief raise head behind rock within hundred yard of behind 'rappahoes be sheltering see now hunting dog said see going to fire there be puff of smoke sharp report almost simultaneously rose indian yell war cry of seneca then five indian leapt out from behind rock made down valley at full speed while from clump of tree two hundred yard above spot from chief have fired four white men hurried out rifle in hand chief waited until joined for bend in valley prevented from seeing that 'rappahoes be making straight down must have be imprudent to have ventured out until white ally came up have gone right down tom shouted at top of voice harry waved arm to show that heard word then five men ran to corner indian be already quarter of mile away be just entering wood below white be about to fire when chief stopped use fire said stand back behind rock good let 'rappahoes count rifle be true enough chief harry said a sprang among rock know at present be that there be two up on top there one down here if be sure that must wipe out must be worth following making running fight of there must be chance of be better to let go without learning more about well must say first thing be to get up horse chief nodded get up said fear 'rappahoes come back to night many hour journey down to village then great council next night scout come up valley look about for sign then go back tell friend dare say be right chief anyhow will feel great deal more comfortable when have got critter up be late in afternoon before reached hut hour be spent in collecting tuft of grass in place sheltered from snow in cutting off great bundle of young fir branch head of evergreen bush horse arrived almost hidden under load of grass foliage carried little be said until hot tea have be drunk bear steak in readiness be disposed of for although have worked hard kept comparatively warm down in valley have a moved slowly up path with horse become chilled to bone now then chief harry said when have lighted pipe with mixture of tobacco willow bark that have taken to a soon a found that be likely to be imprisoned winter must hold council have be longer than expected without disturbance by varmint have come now question be what be to do have agreed along there be getting over pas till spring come too cold chief said deep drift snow indian say can pas over hill in winter that air fact jerry said down in valley there be all right up here cold pretty near take one breath away ai sure about way must get over pas in one day tramp must be stiff before morning there must be taking horse there be hundred mile to be done over snow before reach fort ai to be thought of must sight rather go down valley fight hull tribe agree with jerry might with luck get down valley think there be possibility of crossing pas till winter break can go down valley leaping horse said find trail on snow sure be so chief in case be evident that have got to fight out here good place to stop seneca said good place to fight be self evident enemy on rock above must be able to fire down through roof without having chance of making effectual reply only way can see harry said after long pause be to build sort of fort up above if put just at top of pathway must have whether came up by trail from below climbed up anywhere else came along above need not be very big place only just big enough for to fire over might make sort of shelter in with fire keep guard there by turn chief nodded there be general exclamation of assent from others worst of be jerry said ground be so 'tarnal hard that there will be driving post into have cut down tree near bottom of pas must be risky thing to go up higher when might have red skin come whooping up valley at time why not make snow fort tom suggested there be four foot of snow up there with shovel must make wall ten foot high in very short time so might tom be capital idea difficulty be snow doe not bind in bitter cold a doe in england if be hammered down must must think uncle know esquimaux make snow house be a cold there a be here snow at top be light enough must think a get down must be hard enough to cut out in block have plenty of water if pour over layer of block must freeze into solid ice directly when finish might pour more water down over outside must make regular wall of ice that one must climb up hooray bully for tom jerry shouted while similar exclamation of approval broke from others while chief said gravely young brother have head of man be able to teach warrior will be engineer in chief tom harry said be certain may sleep quietly to night at daybreak to morrow will begin job first thing in morning semicircular line be traced out at top of pathway be thirty foot across for a tom said wall ought to be at least four foot thick six foot must be better a must want parapet at least two foot thick to fire over be agreed that white must use two shovel by turn indian be unaccustomed to work be to undertake of scouting along hillside of watching by turn at night frying pan be brought into requisition wooden handle being made for hard upper crust be removed with shovel layer beneath be sufficiently soft for instrument to be used a shovel below hardened must be cut out in great block loose snow be thrown inside of line traced out a fast a block be cut out be carried piled regularly to form face tom share of work be to keep on melting snow to bring up pour between over block a fast a line of be made loose snow be thrown in behind trampled down hard except for meal there be rest chief said that a there be little chance of 'rappahoes coming up so soon hunting dog have better stay behind help lent aid in carrying block of snow on rough stretcher made for purpose by time became dark wall have risen to height of three foot above general level of snow be already sufficient to form excellent breastwork at end farthest from side from indian be likely to come gap be left between edge of ravine three foot wide in order that if necessary horse must pas out when became dark chief returned have gone many mile along towards main valley have seen sign of indian after supper be over took one of wapiti skin buffalo robe went up to fort a have already called laid deer skin down on slope of snow behind wall wrapped buffalo robe round lay down upon hunting dog then threw robe over projecting foot beyond head so that must from time to time raise look out over snow night be dark one object moving across unbroken white surface must be seen at considerable distance feel sure must go to sleep tom said if be to lie down like have doubt must tom there be fear with chief indian never sleep on watch if doe sleep be like dog seems to hear a well a if be awake minute two eye open take look round must rather have indian sentry than dozen white one unless be in open where there be tree to lean against man must keep moving hunting dog threw down a soon a returned to hut be almost instantly asleep three hour later rose went out leaping horse minute two later returned quiet said then after smoking for short time also lay down chapter xii snow fort hut be quiet at unusually early hour for men have done very hard day work felt strain after long week of inactivity at daybreak be up about must remain out few minute for cold be so intense that felt unable to face until have taken hot tea eaten something hour sufficed for early breakfast hunting dog be again left behind by chief when started two eye enough latter said hunting dog more use here wall of block be raised three more foot during day a be agreed to devote effort to to defer work of thickening until next day for snow have now be cleared so far from foot that must no longer be thrown inside though six foot above snow level be at least three foot more above level of rock face be solid sheet of ice tom having during two day made innumerable journey backwards forward with snow water couple of foot will be high enough for anything harry said believe that indian will venture to attack be just a well to have so high that ca help other up to top if knew how strong be be sure must not attack must leave alone altogether if hundred of creep up in dark make rush will do best to try to climb anyhow sha' need to make bank behind very high if go to within four foot half of top so that can stand fire over wall be be wanted leaping horse returned at dusk a before uttered warm approval of work when have examined good fort said better than palisade indian climb over opening to fire through good a wall of town house think will be puzzled when get here chief must watch well to night chief said indian scout sure to come two men keep on watch two better than one be so chief will change hour will be mighty cold see why must rig up shelter against wall have bit of fire there then two on watch can take by turn few minute to come in get warm with pole skin lean to be speedily constructed against wall snow be hammered down hearth made of dozen log packed closely together brand be brought up from fire in hut skin across end of lean to dropped so that air within must get warm while be at supper hunting dog tom will take first watch harry said sam will take next jerry ben third then chief can take next leaping horse watch by seneca said eye will be open very well chief know be a good a two of so will give one hour out three hour in bed wrapping buffalo robe round tom young indian went up to fort tom drew aside one of skin looked into shelter hearth be in glow two log lying on be burning well night be very still except for occasional rumble of distant snow slide for few minute stood looking over wall keeping far back so that only head be above level tom go in by fire indian said white need for four eye very well will go in first mind have got to go in afterwards sha' go in if after waiting for few minute in shelter tom went out again hunting dog took place be first war path nothing must have persuaded to retire from watch have not felt sure that even white men eye must not fail to detect dark object moving on surface of snow although white surface be not level here there be sudden elevation marking rise in rock beneath still seemed impossible to tom that anyone must approach unseen in spite of protection of buffalo robe be intensely cold outside be glad time when turn came for warm by fire change too made time pas quickly be quite surprised when uncle sam came out to relieve other two men chief be still smoking by fire there be tea in kettle evidently did not mean to lie down until after first watch few minute chief got up went out to platform stood listening there intently for short time just before be time to change guard again said when returned indian down in valley have heard chief leaping horse heard dead stick crack might have be deer ben suggested chief shook head heard gun strike tree then reckon will be up in watch ben said well will be ready for perhaps come perhaps not come perhaps scout up valley first see if of there look for horse perhaps come up path crawl up slow not know whether look out there well envy if have got much crawling to do to night be cold enough to freeze one breath 'rappahoe not like cold chief said want scalp bad make blood warm will let of out jerry said wrathfully if get chance to lay bead on one of be afeard chief will look out sharp enough bet waal reckon be about time to turn out ben jerry tell that have heard noise below chief harry said when came in heard nothing ai easy to hear well with hood over one head hood bad for hear chief assented leaping horse heard plain indian down below well be only what expected chief anyhow be ready for when come tom lay down now knew nothing more till hunting dog touched time to go watch said have everything be quiet indian nodded come yet leaping horse remained at post after came out to relieve tom made comment harry have impressed upon necessity for absolute silence if hear voice will never come near have said must rather came than stopped away sooner get job over better chief stood with head slightly bent forward hood of hunting shirt thrown back listening attentively then touched hunting dog stooping low down whispered something in ear then stood again listening tom too threw back hood must hear nothing whatever be soon glad to pull forward over ear again strained eye in direction towards be listening be apparently towards edge of ravine where indian trail came up from below seemed to to be white bare presently chief rifle went up to shoulder there be sharp crack dark figure leapt up from snow fifty yard away then fell headlong down again seemed to tom almost magical eye have be fixed in direction for last five minute must have sworn that surface of snow be unbroken minute later other four men came running up what be chief harry whispered leaping horse pointed to dark figure stretched out on snow so have got varmint good do think there be more of about more there sure chief said pointing to path up from below perhaps more there pointed to broad black line from foot of cliff to edge of ravine where three day before avalanche from hill above have swept rock clear of snow must have made sure that be asleep that fellow must never have shown on snow harry said did not show uncle how got there know be looking at spot when chief fired saw sign of how hid know if have be anywhere else must have said must have have white sheet over certainly be not that whatever be tom however will see in morning well may a well turn in again will try again do think chief not try to night too cold if there will hide up till daybreak now know be awake will not venture on snow hour later great fire be lighted out of gunshot range lower down valley three four figure must be seen round too cold hunting dog said to tom gone down to get warm watch be relieved regularly through night there be further alarm until just after daylight have broken when sam hick suddenly discharged rifle others turned out at once have fired at bush just at point where trail came up from below declared that have seen slight movement there that piece of snow have dropped from leaf will make sure that there be one there harry said then will turn out have look be like enough that one of red skin from below came up path to have look at morning took steady aim fired fetch up axe tom will cut bush away at once be lucky that sam caught sight of red skin if have not done so might have got bullet in own head for when red skin have finished taking view of fort must certainly have picked off sam before went down be weak point that from here one ca command path if come in force will have to keep watch on platform too from there can get sight of two three of turning illustration went out to look at indian chief have shot went out together a passed stopped to look at body of indian chief have shot be young brave of two three twenty manner of advance so far unperceived be now evident favoured by slight fall in ground have crawled forward scooping trench wide enough for body foot in depth pushing snow always forward so that formed sort of bank in front of screened from sight of on watch chief keen eye have perceived slight movement of snow after watching moment have fired at point where judged anyone concealed by must be have calculated accurately ball have struck on shoulder close to neck have passed down through body indian have brought no rifle with have knife tomahawk in belt poor young fellow harry said wanted to win name for by deed of desperate bravery have cost life a must have taken ours if have have chance be of use regretting now went on to bush be right sam went on a saw impression on snow made by figure lying down behind there be indian here sure enough here be mark of stock of rifle doubt must have picked off one of if have not scared expect hit there be sign of blood fire too high chief said pointing to twig have be freshly cut off two foot from ground always shoot low at man behind bush man can not float in air there be general laugh at sam who replied did not suppose must chief just fired where saw snow fall without thinking about one way other be fired fool will know better next time bush be cut down also two three others grew along by edge of ravine on way back to hut harry stopped by dead indian fetch shovel tom said will dig hole in snow ai pleasant object to be looking at anyway tom fetched shovel harry dug down in snow till reached rock then jerry laid body in filled in snow again chief looked on bear get said when have finished that be like enough chief have done best can for there be digging into rock thought indian always scalped enemy shot tom afterwards said to uncle so do tom see chief be sort of civilized indian have consorted for year with white know that like say must do if be on war path by with doe at rate not openly have doubt went against grain to see red skin buried with hair on for scalp must have be creditable one a must not have be got without clear eye good judgment in shooting have doubt have got scalp about now though show will be hung up day if ever settle down in wigwam of own well chief what do think asked leaping horse a after returning to hut sat down to breakfast will come wo think come chief said scout behind bush will tell fort too strong to take must cross snow many fall before get to very hard to climb like cold leaping horse think will stop in wigwam fool jerry agreed man must be worse than natural if be to go fooling about in weather run pretty good big risk of getting shot nothing much to gain by know have left country now ai likely to come back again either to hunt there to dig gold that want be to get away a soon a can allow that chief be right that sha' hear more of anyhow not for time chief nodded if come again not come now wait moon then think perhaps sleep sound try again more likely not try much more likely harry assented unless can do by surprise indian be not fond of attacking know shoot straighter than do have better rifle remember that time when jersey dick kept off party of navaho from sunrise till sunset down near emigrant trail be lucky for that post rider who be passing along heard firing took news to fort that officer there brought out fifty trooper just a sun went down must have be rubbed out that night sure seneca nodded how be harry sam hick asked be just usual thing sam have left trail two day before be hunting on own account when navaho came down have just time to throw three horse lie down behind be within two hundred yard when began fetched chief who be leading out of saddle leaping horse brought down one jersey dick held fire instead of keeping straight on began to straggle round kept at day sometimes must get in pretty close time did chief brought down horse when rider who be of course hanging on other side of got up to run fetched down dick be much of shot so must not let fire discourages red skin mightily when see that there be never shot thrown away that be sure death whenever one draw trigger so at last got careful held off knowing a must get at night when must have crawled up on foot made rush when got close to worst of be have struck water evening before be just one of hottest day on plain be pretty nigh mad with thirst before evening believe when soldier rode up be about a glad to get drink from one of bottle a be that navaho bolted when saw coming no red skin ai good for open attack must have lost fewer men by riding straight at than did by fooling round must not bring to do reckon be what will be here may a

difficulty in restraining from shouting singing chief before starting have warned of necessity for travelling silently snow slide very bad now shouting might set going others looked rather incredulous harry said know be right boy for have heard that in alp guide always forbid talking when be crossing place exposed to avalanche at rate may a well give snow a little chance a may be of going for travelled in indian file from habit rather than necessity for snow be firm hard horse made way over without difficulty there have be debate a to way must go determined at last to take valley through cliff wall to strike to right whenever came upon likely spot for crossing two such attempt be made in vain upper slope of snow being found too steep for horse to climb at third be made just after morning broke succeeded in getting up hill to right after great difficulty descended into valley have little doubt be one led to pas for from hill must see great peak along whose foot trail ran be ten

many men not get much plunder trapper here good friend with trader bring up powder cloth bead indian give trouble for next six week therefore travelled slowly camping sometimes for two three day on stream then making long march until again came to water beaver trap have be left behind be fortunate enough to come upon several beaver village by exercising patience be able to shoot good many getting in fifty skin tom used to go out in evening lie down to watch beaver at work must not take gun must not shoot down in cold blood uncle be almost like looking at village of human being at work

term with so be pleased with look out know well enough be likely to be best strike ever made in life kept near edge of bad land a have gone farther out must have be obliged to make long detour to get round head of canyon made by river running down into colorado have filled water skin at last stream where have camped have taken with enough dried wood for fire lit night in hollow a from upper slope of ute hill view must be obtained for great distance over flat rocky plateau tom be heartily glad when two day journey be over not living creature have met eye there be grass on beast must exist earth in prairie dog must burrow even bird shunned bare waste of rock be desolate country said a sat round fire must be enough to give one horror if one be alone be hot now in height of summer heat glare from rock must be awful be tom many many man have died of thirst in bad land what make more terrible be that can perhaps see water thousand foot below yet die from want of when be camped on green river uncle said that one have ever followed down be so lad one know whereabouts go a men driven by thirst have followed canyon down to in place run for many mile across low land before plunge into canyon then cut way for two three hundred mile perhaps through hill with wall two three thousand foot high one so far a know have gone down big canyon be certain there be rapid whirlpool rock in two three party have gone down through of shorter canyon to escape indian most of have never be heard of again one two have got down distance managed to escape one have followed course by land must not do so unless carried provision drink food for animal even then expedition must take month perhaps year to do for spring from hill run down canyon to river sometimes fifty mile sometimes hundred long time party came upon one of must have to work up to mountain to get round be over thousand mile in straight line from place where green river first enters canyon to where colorado issue out on to plain may be quite twice that distance if one must follow winding day when country fill up attempt will doubt be made to find out something about will be big job whenever be tried may cost lot of life before canyon be explored in morning started westward for hill greatest care be observed on march took advantage of depression when obliged to pas over level ground moved at distance apart a clump string of

found lode lay about mile up narrow valley running into larger one rivulet trickled down centre reckoned on harry said of course be frozen when be here must see that there be water in summer see hollow run right up into wood there be sure to be water in for next three month anyhow have gone short distance up when stopped at spot where streamlet widened out into pool let try here jerry said see if there be sign shovelful of sand be placed in vanner with small quantity of water while harry sam proceeded to wash gravel roughly in pan tom stood watching jerry operation gave gentle motion to vanner caused content to revolve coarser particle being thrown towards edge while finer remained in centre water be poured away rougher particle of gravel sand swept off by hand fresh water be then added process repeated again again until at last more than spoonful of fine sand remained in centre sideway action of vanner caused to slope gradually down towards edge at very bottom three tiny bit of yellow metal be seen be bigger than pin head seemed to tom that be miserably small return for five minute labour others seemed well satisfied be still more pleased when on two pan being cleaned out several little piece of gold be found one of be nearly a large a small pea be good enough ben said will run lot richer when get down on to rock at two other place on way up tried experiment with increasingly good result there be tall work to be done here with washing harry said now come on to vein only saw one of there must be lot more must not find so much metal in sand however one saw be good enough for anything went on again to point where rock cropped boldly out on side of valley harry led few pace up side pointed to white patch in rock be where chipped off lad three year ago face of lode discoloured by age weather differed little from rock surrounding where have be broken off be whitish yellow thickly studded with little bit of dull yellow metal sticking out of be not greatly impressed saw from face of companion that be at once surprised delighted by gosh harry have done time sam hick exclaimed have struck rich mistake thought from way talked of must be something out of way be blamed if thought be like stand back chap jerry said lifting heavy sledge hammer let get drive at here be crack put one of wedge in ben wedge be placed in fissure ben held while jerry gave few light blow to get firmly fixed will do ben take away hand let drive at swinging hammer round head jerry brought down with tremendous force on head of wedge again again heavy hammer rose fell with accuracy of machine upon right spot until wedge be nine inch long be buried in crevice now one ben give longer one time time ben held wedge until be half buried having perfect confidence in jerry skill be not until fourth wedge have be driven in fragment of rock weighing four five hundredweight suddenly broke out from face bent eagerly over miner gave shout of joy inner surface be white slightly stained with yellow with blur of slate colour here there be thickly studded with gold stuck out above surface in thin leafy plate with ragged edge with here there larger spongy mass reckon that be good enough jerry said wiping sweat from forehead ef there be enough of be biggest thing that ever be struck there ai no saying how rich be will bet boot be over five hundred ounce to ton ai in nature that be going to run far like be good enough for anything well what be next thing harry will break up harry said carry down with to camp if ute came down on tomorrow must get off with must be plenty to show if want to make sale took long time to break up rock for quartz be hard be so bound together by leafy gold running through that of four men have several spell with hammer before be broken up into fragment weighing twenty pound apiece a soon a be done men collected earth filled up hole in face of rock planted several large tuft of grass in poured four five tin of water over then smeared with mud patch where harry have before broken piece off what be that for jerry tom asked be to hide up trace lad may have to bolt away from here to morrow morning for anything know before come back again someone else may come along though will locate claim at mining register there must be lot of trouble if anyone else have taken possession be working vein when got back be not likely that anyone else must come along here jerry waal reckon be so one ai going to trust to chance when one have struck on place a seneca have be only unmoved person in party what do think of chief harry asked if white brother be pleased leaping horse be glad replied indian doe not care for gold what can do with have good gun doe not want twenty doe not want many hunting suit if be to buy a many horse a must fill valley must not ride must soon tire of sitting in lodge being waited upon by many wife have enough for need now when be old will be time to rest well be philosophy chief say be wrong from way of looking at that gold mean lot to mean going home to people mean living in comfort for rest of life mean making friend happy leaping horse be glad chief said gravely can not forget that to mean that white brother with whom have so long hunted camped fought bad indian will go away across great salt water leaping horse will see more be so chief harry said grasping indian hand warmly be selfish brute not to think of before there be one thing will promise year so will come out here do couple of month hunting with journey be long be quickly made now know after knocking about for twenty year will never be content if take run out on plain for bit summer will give word leaping horse that a long a have health strength will come out regularly that will see white brother friendship be a strong a own seneca grave face lit up with pleasure white brother be very good said have taken away thorn out of heart of leaping horse indian brother be glad now quartz be placed in sack have brought with to carry down sample at once returned to camp where after smoking pipe lay down to sleep be time before went off so excited be at thought of fortune seemed before in afternoon took one of piece of stone weighing by spring balance twenty pound with flat plate crushing hammer went to stream rock be first broken with sledge into piece size of walnut be pulverized on iron plate result carefully washed when work be finished gold be weighed in miner scale turned four ounce weight be nearly five hundred ounce to ton harry said of course be not going to run like reckon be rich pocket there may be ton of stuff there may be fifty now let go up have quiet look for lode see if can trace ought to see on rock other side careful search showed quartz vein on face of rock fifty foot higher up valley showed direction of run of lode be here however only six inch wide instead of being two foot a at spot where be first found piece be broken off there be gold embedded in be evident that be nothing like so rich a on other side piece of ten pound be pounded up returned only little over pennyweight of gold about twelve ounce to ton harry said not bad mighty falling off from other to morrow morning will follow lode on other side see if can strike outcrop next day found lode cropping up through rock thirty yard from great find be about nine inch wide dug out with pick to depth of two foot so a to get fair sample when crushed gave return at rate of twenty ounce be rich enough again must pay splendidly if worked by machinery of course question be how far hold on a rich a found at face how keep on in depth be just what ca find want drill powder a pick be sort of good on hard quartz supposing go off gradually from face to point there must be million of dollar in even supposing pinched in below there be reason in world to suppose may a well take few of chunk of rock will show that gold hold fairly good way back anyhow few piece be put aside rest thrown into hole again be stamped down filled up with dust party then went back to dinner consultation be held a to what be next to be done of course must stake out claim at once harry said in first place there be own eight claim two for of discoverer one for others hunting dog will not have share will be paid regular rate a hunter then will take twenty claim in name of men know must hold water if be well known place everyone scrambling to get claim on lode a there be one to cut in one will know place till have sold company sends up to take possession work ai likely to be disputed question be what will do now will make back to settlement try washing bit try washing must say jerry said may be time before can sell place anyone buying will know that will have to send up force big enough to fight ute besides will want someone to come up here to examine before close bargain vote stick here work gravel for bit so a to take enough away to keep till next spring reckon will find plenty of stuff in a go down if be so ca do better than stick to a long a there be water in creek agree with there jerry will never do to risk losing first sample be ready to stay here through summer vote sew up in deer hide put two three thickness of skin on so a to prevent accident two of have best go with to fort ask major to let stow away in magazine then if have to bolt sha' be weighted down with besides might not have time for packing on horse altogether must be best to get away at once then come what might must have proof of value of mine proposal be cordially agreed to be settled that on following morning harry must with

middle of clump in be still encamped be first roughly squared then sawn into plank three men taking by turn to use saw question of shifting camp up to spot where intended to work be discussed night before harry started be agreed at last that must be better to remain where be if ute come sure to find trace chief said many horse in valley make track a plain a noonday gold valley bad place for fight be so jerry agreed must not have show there even if made log house must be dog goned trouble to carry up log might be shut up in red skin must only have to lie round shoot down if came out reckon have best stay here after harry must keep outside range of rifle anyhow by day see that must be much good to jerry for if came by day must not find here still know that ai best for to stay here must give lot of trouble to build place reckon two of have better stay here day with horse if red skin come can fire couple of shot will hear up at washing place red skin must be safe to draw off for bit to talk over before attacked a must not know how many there be among tree must give rest time to come down took three day hard work to saw plank make cradle trough sufficiently long to lead water down into from stream higher up be roughly strongly made joint being smeared with clay to prevent water from running through dam be then made to keep back water above spot where intended to begin be

there chief seneca nodded be comfort sha' be likely to run out of fresh meat chief be very careful in choosing wood for fire so in daytime smoke must be seen rising from tree when dead wood in clump of tree be exhausted rode down valley day returned in hour with large faggot fastened behind on horse always started before daybreak so a to reduce risk of being seen from hill on sixth day men began work at gravel bottle of mercury be emptied into cradle bottom of have be made with greatest care so a to prevent loss from leakage two of men brought up gravel in bucket pan until cradle be half full then water be let in third man rocked machine kept on removing coarse stuff worked up to top while others continued bringing up fresh gravel well what luck tom asked when returned in evening have not cleaned up yet will let run for three four day before do be only on surface yet stuff must pay for trouble of washing out on eighth day after departure harry hunting dog returned well boy be stowed away safely said know major well let have big chest locked up after have put bag in have stowed away in magazine so there be fear of being touched sign of red skin nary sign have none of be up valley beyond so that unless come right down here must find trail horse be always driven down valley at night how be work going on jerry began washing two day ago to morrow night will clean up think be going to turn out pretty good for have seen gold in sand several time a have carried up in pail next day tom went up with others indian remaining in camp two men now worked at cradle while other three brought up sand gravel towards evening began work of cleaning up more stuff be brought up to machine water be still run into a fast a shaking brought rough gravel to top be removed until only foot of sand remained at bottom water be now stopped sand dug out carefully washed in pan by hand at bottom of pan there remained after sand have be removed certain amount of gold dust quantity increasing a bottom be approached last two panfuls contained considerable amount doe not look much tom said when whole be collected together be heavy stuff lad harry replied what do think there be jerry about twelve ounce must fancy harry nigher fourteen must think pan be now put at bottom of cradle plug pulled out quicksilver run into portion of be poured on wash end of be held up by men so a to form bag harry took leather holding over pan twisted round round a pressure on quicksilver increased ran through pore of leather in tiny stream until at last lump of pasty metal remained be squeezed again again until not single globule of quicksilver passed through leather ball be of consistency of half dried mortar be then taken out process repeated again again until whole of quicksilver have be passed through leather six lump of amalgam about size of small hen egg remained be that good uncle tom asked very fair lad wonderfully good indeed considering have not got down far yet must say will get pound half of gold out of how doe gold get into uncle there be what be called affinity between quicksilver gold moment gold touch quicksilver be absorbed by just a drop of water be taken up by lump of salt thickens quicksilver a be squeezed through leather quicksilver be a be strained out what remains behind becomes thicker thicker until a see be almost solid be good to use more pressure for if do certain amount of gold must be squeezed through leather see a stuff in cradle be shaken gold being heavier than sand find way down to bottom particle come in contact with quicksilver be swallowed up by how do get quicksilver out of lump put in one of clay crucible saw with pinch of borax cover up put in heap of glowing ember evaporates quicksilver leaf gold behind in shape of button be done that evening when button be placed in scale just turned two pound weight well boy be good enough for anything harry said that with dust make pound day be a good a very best stuff in early day of california worked steadily for next seven week contrary to expectation gravel be little richer lower down than have found at end of first wash up continued about equally good result averaged about pound weight of gold day be put into little bag of deer skin containing five pound weight bag be distributed among saddle bag so that in case of sudden disturbance there must be risk of being left behind indian took by turn to hunt at other time remained on guard in camp tom only staying when one of be away one day when mining party stopped work sat down to eat bread cold meat have from first brought up so a to save loss of time entailed by going to camp back report of gun came upon ear started to foot seized rifle then stood listening intently minute later two more shot be heard at close interval red skin for sure jerry exclaimed thought a how luck be too good to last started at run down little valley only paused when reached mouth harry then advanced cautiously until must obtain view of main valley paused for minute then rejoined companion there be fifty of said if there be one be ute in war paint be bit up valley think if make rush can get to tree before can cut off must try anyhow sam hick said else will get two indian horse saddle just let get breath for moment then will start keep close together a run harry said then if do come up can get back to back make fight of after short pause started have not gone twenty yard when loud yell proclaimed that indian have seen have however three hundred yard to run while ute be double that distance from clump when miner be within fifty yard of tree two rifle shot rang out two of ute who be somewhat ahead of rest fell from horse while rest swerved off seeing that there be hope of cutting party off few more yard miner be among tree so ute have found out chief harry said a joined leaping horse who have just reloaded ride must have tracked be war party seneca replied hunter must have found track taken news back to village well have got to fight for be clear enough harry said anyhow now see there be seven of be not likely to attack until get dark so have time to think over what have best be done have just begun meal when heard shot best thing can do be to have good feed at once may be too busy later on chief said word to young indian leaving on watch accompanied others to fire have scarcely sat down when hunting dog came up more ute said briefly pointing across valley at once went to outer line of tree on brow of rise opposite be party of horseman between twenty thirty strong show have learnt about position harry said fellow have be lying in wait somewhere over hill to cut off if took to horse on seeing main body let have look other side crossing clump of tree saw on brow there party of ute reckon must have crossed that valley be working in just after got through jerry said be mighty lucky did not come down on while be washing for must have wiped out before have time to get hold of gun well harry be in pretty tight fix with fifty of up valley five twenty so on side of will have to be dog goned smart if be to get out of scrape hand rifle tom uncle said carry farther than mine will give fellow hint that have best move off bit steadying piece against tree took careful aim fired one of indian swerved in saddle then fell forward on neck of horse turned galloped off with rest now will have meal take council chief harry said a turned away if have got to fight there be occasion to fight fire be made up there be need to be careful now strip of deer flesh be hung over meal be soon ready little be said while be being eaten then lighted pipe put pannikin of hot tea beside now chief harry said have arrived at way out of be worse than be last time got caught in valley chief shook head good fight here said when night come creep up round yes see that have got to bolt question be how if be to ride must ride down be certain jerry tom might possibly get away though ai likely critter be good nothing downright extraordinary chance be that of ute have got faster horse than a for rest of must have before have ridden hour ai to be thought of jerry said seems to best chance must be to leave critter behind to crawl out moment get dark try get beyond will close in a soon a get dark jerry will know well enough that be time will be moving reckon must not have chance worth cent of getting through what do say chief leaping horse nodded in assent well then sam hick said vote mount horse go right at must rather do get rubbed out in fair fight than lie here until crawl up finish one answered for minute smoked on without word being spoken then harry said there be only one chance for can see be to mount now to ride right down valley chief say that in place be not more than fifty yard wide with steep cliff on side must make much better fight there for must only attack in front there must be nothing for then to dismount close in upon from tree to tree must make running fight of until come to mouth of canyon there must be place there that ought to be able to hold with seven rifle against lot of bully for harry reckon must give chance anyhow be if ai cut off before get to wood let have look round see what be doing harry said ah here come hunting dog will tell about ute on hill gone up joined others young indian said a came up must not be better news harry exclaimed reckon have moved away to tempt to make start for fort for know if go way will have sure have not reckoned on riding down valley for will be sure must have found out long ago that there ai way out of well have best lose time there be meat ready hunting dog have best fill up while get ready for start blanket buffalo rug be wrapped up strapped behind saddle a soon a be placed behind horse have only small quantity of meat left a chief be going out hunting next morning fastened eighty pound of flour still remained on to one of pack horse filled powder horn from keg put three four dozen bullet into holster together with cartridge for pistol rest of ammunition be packed on horse when be completed mounted may get couple of hundred yard more start before be seen harry said anyhow have got five hundred yard may reckon on making two mile to where valley narrow before catch instant however emerged from wood two loud yell be heard from indian who have be left lying down on watch at top of slope on side sam who be worst shot of party have volunteered to lead string of pack horse while ben be ready to urge on behind may want to stop of leading varmint must not be much good at game so will keep straight on without paying attention to loud answering yell rose from indian up valley will gain fifty yard so before be fairly in saddle harry said a went off at top of speed horse seeming to know that loud war cry boded danger have gone mile before looked round indian be riding in confused mass be distance past grove miner have left still appeared a far behind a have be when started mile mass have broken up best mounted indian have left rest distance behind considerably decreased gap between fugitive five minute latter reached wood began just where valley narrowed cliff rose almost perpendicularly on side a soon a did so leapt from horse posting behind tree opened fire at pursuer nearest of whom be two hundred yard away four fell to first seven shot others turned galloped back to main body who halted at once wo try charge harry said be in indian nature to come across open with muzzle of seven rifle pointed at will palaver now know have got in trap will wait till night now chief reckon that hunting dog have best stay here so that if try a be pretty sure to do to find out whether be here still can give hint to keep off other four have better ride straight down canyon go on for bit to find out best place for making stand a soon a be dark will go forward join there will be occasion for to hurry reckon skunk will crawl up here soon after be dark wo go much farther for might hide up somewhere might miss in morning will come down on foot sheltering behind tree a much a can till at last locate chief nodded approval of plan tom three miner at once started taking pack horse with on way down came upon bear ben be about to fire jerry said best leave alone ben be only three mile down cliff must echo sound red skin must hear know of have gone down valley might make rush at once in hour half came down to spot where valley after widening out good bit suddenly terminated stream entered deep canyon in face of wall of rock closed in reckon part of valley be lake once jerry said when got pretty well full began to run over where canyon be gradually cut way out down to colorado wonder how far be to river have gone hundred yard down canyon when came to place where recent fall of rock blocked up through stream be small one made way there be grist of water come down here when snow melt in spring ben remarked can see that rock be worn fifty foot up waal reckon place be good enough for jerry reckon so too latter agreed will be job to get horse over have got to do anyhow if have to carry animal however managed to scramble up rock filled canyon to height of thirty foot distance between rock wall be not more than in width must hold place for year ben said if did take to chucking rock down from above yes be only danger jerry agreed betting be must not get nigh enough to edge to look down still might do if ground be level above anyhow must not show much at depth for be pretty dark down here rock must be seven eight hundred foot high be indeed narrow strip of sky that saw a looked up although still broad daylight in valley have left be almost dark at bottom of deep gorge became pitch dark a soon a light above faded first job in morning jerry said will be to explore place down below expect there be place where widens out if doe there be tree anything like grass horse can get bite of food if not will mighty soon go under be if come upon game for if sha' be able to spare flour be almost pity did not leave in valley to take chance tom said make mistake jerry said in first place may come in useful to yet even if never get astride of again may come in mighty handy for food say a may get bear if there be opening in canyon terrace where can come down if there ai be just horse meat have got to depend on look here boy be 'tarnal dark here ca see own hand vote get light there be lot of drift wood jammed in among stone where climbed up will do to start fire saw lot more just at mouth of gap know red skin ai near yet so vote grope way up bring down will be first rate thing too to make bit of fire half way between here mouth must put stop to crawling up a be like enough to try to do to make out whereabouts be of course will have to damp own fire down if come else must show up agin light if went up on rock others agreed at once for be dull work sitting there in black darkness have match piece of dry fir be soon found be lighted served a torch with to climb over rock jammed in between on upper side be large quantity of drift wood be pulled out made into bundle carried over rock barrier fire be soon blazing there then taking brand two ax went up to mouth of gorge cut up arm of tree have be brought down by last flood left there a water sank greater part of be taken down to camping place rest with plenty of small wood to light be piled halfway between barrier mouth of canyon be soon blazing brightly be returning to camping place when ben exclaimed that heard sound of horse hoof stopped to listen there be not more than three of ben said be coming along at canter expect will hear anything of red skin until tomorrow morning heard horse enter canyon then jerry shouted be right harry yes red skin be quiet when came away why where be shouted again when came up to fire hundred yard farther on will show light two three blazing brand be brought up harry indian have dismounted at first fire now led horse up to stone barrier what on arth have lit that other fire for jerry harry asked a stopped at foot of barrier because will sleep dog goned sight better with there a like a not may send on two three young warrior to scout be a black a wolf mouth might have sat listening night then must not have heard with fire there dare not come on for must know must not pas without getting bullet in well be very good idea jerry must not think what be up when got there did not see anybody see have fire over other side must make out clear enough a came on will burn down bit presently jerry said must not try to get horse up here now harry be bad place to come up in daylight like enough must break leg if tried now will do just a well there a must on side can get over a soon a day break must rather get over jerry see be pretty rough place leaving horse harry indian climbed over barrier be soon seated with others round fire over meat be already frizzling so indian kept quiet afternoon harry a quiet a be nature two three time of rode down galloped backwards forward in front of to make out if be there time let fool about for good long spell then when got bit careless sent ball two to let know be still there hunting dog went with three horse mile down valley soon after have gone so that might not hear ride off a soon a began to get dusk started have to come pretty slow for got so dark under tree must not make out trunk have to let horse pick own way knew there be hurry for must not follow till morning though of course scout must creep up a soon a be dark must be long before found out that have left reckon will come camp in wood wait for daylight before move though say two three scout may not crawl down to try find out where be will move pretty slow for will have to pick way will know well enough that if twig crack will bring bullet among reckon wo get here under four five hour be sartin wo try to pas fire above a soon a see will take word back to others will have whole lot down here by morning will have to get horse over first thing two of have best go down a soon a be light enough to ride without risking neck to see what canyon be like below yes be most important jerry there may be break where red skin must get down so catch between two fire care red cent for ute jerry said can lick out of boot in canyon what have be thinking of be whether there be place where horse can get enough to keep alive while be shut up here if there be game so much better if there ai have got to take to horseflesh how long do suppose that indian be likely to wait when find that ca get at tom asked there ai sort of saying uncle replied reckon one ever found out yet how long red skin patience will last time ai nothing to will follow up canyon side till be sartin that there ai place where man can climb up if there ai will just squat in valley like enough will send for lodge squaw fix there till winter come even then might not go have got wood water of will hunt bring in meat will dry for winter be just a likely to stay here a to go up to village vigilant watch be kept up night two of being always on guard at top of barrier a soon a morning broke three horse be got over hour later harry sam hick rode off down canyon while others took place on guard keeping well behind rock between looked out have not long to wait for indian be seen to dart rapidly across mouth of canyon two rifle cracked out indian appearance disappearance be so sudden quick that have reason to believe that have hit will know now that be here be pretty wide awake ben said may be sure that caught sight of rock minute two later several rifle flashed from among fallen stone at mouth of gorge keep eye open jerry said when see slightest movement fire do unless feel certain that make out head limb have got to show ute that be sartin death to try crawl up here almost immediately afterwards head appeared above stone chief rifle cracked at same instant head disappeared do think got chief think so not sure leaping horse doe not often miss mark at two hundred yard almost directly afterwards tom fired indian sprang to foot bounded away what did fire at tom think be arm shoulder tom replied be not sure about certainly saw something move fancy must have hit must not have got up waal now reckon be going to have quiet for bit must have have good look at place while be lying there must have seen that air too strong for say may come on again tonight that may do think air more likely wo try must know that must be on watch with seven rifle colt must account for grist of afore got over what do say chief not come now indian said positively send men first along top see if can get down not like come at night canyon of colorado very bad medicine red skin like come into if way where can get up then ute sit down to starve will be longish job chief horse week will keep for three month if food for horse horse die one week so will chief must wait till harry come back then will know what chance be be six hour before harry sam returned there be shout of satisfaction from men when saw that have on saddle hind quarter of bear waal what be news harry ai altogether good ben go down like for about twelve mile then widens out sudden get into crumbly rock have got worn away there be place maybe about fifty yard wide mile long with sloping side going up long way then cliff round bottom be stone there be few tuft of coarse grass growing between on slope there be bush on ledge high up made out bear have two three shot at at last brought down there may be more among bush there be plenty of cover for there be place where there be chance of getting up harry nary place say a there may not be must see one bear must have got down no must come down here in dry season looking for water hole finding place to liking must have concluded to settle there be just place bear must choose for might reckon pretty confident that there be chance of being disturbed well went on beyond two mile lower canyon opened again five minute took down on to bank of colorado there be great room between river cliff there be good sized tree there plenty of bush growing up distance caught sight of bear a did not want left alone waal let have b'ar meat first of jerry said finished meat last night bread make much of meal reckon anyhow can do with after have done will have talk know what to expect now can figure up better than must before chapter xv colorado well boy harry wade began after have smoked for time in silence have got to look at matter squarely so far have got out of mighty tight place better than expected yesterday seemed to that there be much chance of carrying hair away now be out of scrape be in pretty nigh a bad though there ai much chance of red skin getting at air so harry be in pretty tight hole bet ai likely to get scalp for time there ai no denying that chance of carrying off be dog goned small bet there ai jerry sam hick said pizon varmint will camp outside here for know have got in trap may attack at present have got to watch night day dark night may take into head to come up there wo be nothing to prevent for rustling of stream among rock must cover little noise might make first must know of must be yell of varmint at foot of barrier afore must get to top two on guard must be tomahawked must be down on like pack of wolf must abeost a soon put down rifle walk straight out now let shoot if knew must do without of devilish torture a go on night after night expecting to be woke up with war yell in ear of course will be always keeping watch there at mouth of canyon couple of boy be enough for for will know that if ride out on horse must go right up valley be nasty place to gallop through in dark besides of will doubt be placed higher up to cut off if got through ai likely must ride down in few hour if crept out on foot got fairly among tree must be better off for must take up trail in morning hunt down tell fairly boy see way out of reckon will come to having to ride out together to wipe out a many of ute a possible afore go down what do say chief leaping horse agrees with white brother straight harry whose mind know waal go on then harry sam said thought that have made end of must have opened out see way out of at present if do be ready to fall in with be see one way out of boy be mighty risky thing ca be more risky than stopping here there be just chance spoke to chief last night owned that did seem to there be chance in other way however said that if went must go with proposal be that take to river try get through canyon there be deep silence among men proposal took by surprise man have ever accomplished journey though two party similarly attacked by indian have attempted to raft down of canyon higher up one party perished to man one survivor of other party escaped to tell tale a to canyon below through must have to pas man have ever explored indian regarded river with deep awe believed canyon to be peopled with demon enterprise be so stupendous danger to be met with so terrible ready a western hunter be to encounter danger one have ever attempted to investigate winding turning of river for two thousand mile made way through terrific precipice ran course three thousand foot below surrounding country until emerged on to plain of mexico be why be so anxious to reach river harry went on after pause wanted to see whether there be tree by must construct raft near bank have there not be must have proposed to follow up down a far a must make way in hope of lighting on tree however a be be just handy for say a will get through boy there be just chance of see other plan must give show jerry be first to speak waal harry can count in one might a well be drowned in rapid carried over fall a killed wuss taken tortured by red skin be so jerry sam hick agreed while ben said waal if git through will be something to talk about life in course there ai no taking horse be out of question ben will not have much time to spare for ute may take into head to attack night besides have mean of making big raft might tie two three trunk together with lariat spike few cross piece on might even make two such raft be outside will carry store a for horse must either leave down in hollow for indian to find put bullet through head expect latter will be best thing for poor beast want tree chief said got horse skin make canoe be right chief harry exclaimed never thought of must be very thing canoe will go down rapid where strongest raft must be dashed to piece if come to bad fall can make shift to carry round others be le pleased with suggestion doubtful expression of face a assented to scheme now changed to one of hopefulness discussed plan eagerly be agreed that not moment must be lost in setting to work to carry out that must forthwith retreat to mouth of lower canyon for entertained secret misgiving that ute might make attack that night felt that if attack be made in earnest must succeed be certain must be able to find point at lower gorge must be held at rate day must be gained for at hour of night indian came up must not venture farther until daybreak there must probably be long palaver before must enter lower canyon tom have not spoken recognized justice of harry reasoning have difficulty in keeping tear back at thought of horse being killed for well nigh year have carried well have tended cared for must come to call rub muzzle against cheek thought that have be alone must have risked anything rather than part with like plan tom harry said to a having packed saddled horse rode together down canyon suppose passage be so terrible after be not thinking of passage at uncle tom said almost indignantly will be grand piece of adventure like hate thought of horse being killed be like killing dear friend to save one self be wrench lad harry said kindly can quite understand feeling like thought see that have got to be done after will be better to kill poor brute than to let fall into hand of indian who know what mercy to beast mean will ride till drop dead without least compunction know be better uncle ever so much better be horrible same anyhow ask to do for must not will see to tom will be one of guard of canyon must not be of much use in making canoe wo have to know anything about till go down get on board tom nodded thanks heart be too full for to speak felt that if said word must break down altogether rode rapidly along passed through little valley where bear have be killed without stopping went down lower canyon carefully examining to fix upon most suitable point for defence there have be recent fall though at point great boulder lay thickly there be one place offered special facility for defence look here boy harry said reining up horse at point within two hundred yard of lower end ca do better than fix here hour work will get up wall will puzzle red skin to get over there be advantage that shot fired here by guard will bring whole force up in couple of minute vote ride horse down to river let pick up what can then come back here build wall will be getting dark in hour time may a well finish job at once ben sam may a well pick out couple of young fir tree bring down at once then there will be time lost five of will be enough for wall keep eye open likely enough there be bear two about must be great thing for to lay in stock of meat before start a soon a issued from gorge horse be unsaddled store taken off pack animal a be doing harry said few word in low tone to sam then carefully examined tree picked out two young fir sam ben took ax other five went up gorge again be soon hard at work collecting boulder piling in wall there be gun uncle tom exclaimed presently well hope have got sight of bear will want stock of meat badly dozen shot be fired tom thought more of a proceeded with work bottom of canyon be fifteen foot wide by time be dark have solid wall across nearly six foot high with place for to stand on to fire over now then tom may a well take post here at once will send sam ben up to watch with think there be shadow of chance of coming to night there be never answering for red skin must leave hunting dog with will want to help make framework for canoe indian be deal handier than be in making lashing will send supper up here lad buffalo robe then can take by turn to watch sleep reckon will be at work all night have got to get job finished a quick a can quarter of hour later sam hick came up have got tree down sam lor ' bless did take minute to do that got down split up then lit fire got meat over kettle mixed dough did kill bear heard firing critter be too high up ai much good at shooting perhaps will get sight of tomorrow harry chief will bring down if be within range of shooting iron be 'tarnal dark up here in twenty minute two light be seen approaching harry hunting dog came up carrying pine wood torch have great faggot of wood fastened on back harry also carried frying pan on be pile of meat two great hunk of bread while hunting dog brought two tin pannikin of hot tea will make more cheerful for harry said a unfastened rope tied faggot to shoulder now hunting dog get good fire a soon a can then come down again to fire be soon blazing merrily tom sam sat down to enjoy meal think one of ought to keep watch sam not bit of sam said red skin will never dare to enter canyon until after dark if started now made way straight on must not be here for three four hour must bet boot come at tonight even if be not scared at must be scared at coming near river in dark will just take meal comfortable smoke pipe then will take first watch will take sleep ai closed eye since night before last tom indeed be nearly asleep before have finished pipe felt that really must get nap so saying to sam be sure wake in two hour rolled in robe instantly fell asleep seemed to that have only just gone off when sam roused leapt to foot however rifle in hand anything matter sam everything quiet miner replied what did wake for then have not be asleep five minute according to reckoning mate have be asleep better'n five hour be about half past eight when went off reckon be two now will begin to get light in hour must not have waked till daybreak found dropping off be awfully sorry tom began trouble young un by time have be a long in west a have wo think anything of two night watch now keep sharp lookout think there be much chance of coming want to be woke up with red skin coming right down on top of see have let fire out sam tom said with little shiver put out hour ago sam said a prepared to lie down must never have done to keep night for red skin must see head over top of wall while must not get sight of till be within arm length tom took up post gazed earnestly into darkness beyond wall felt that sense of vision must be of use whatever therefore threw faculty into of listening slight a be chance of indian coming yet felt somewhat nervous be satisfaction to to see beyond mouth of canyon glow of fire by a knew others be hard at work in hour morning began to break a soon a must see well up canyon relighted fire jumping up to take look over wall minute so be not long before saw uncle approaching with kettle saw smoke tom guessed that must be glad of mug of hot tea have seen sign of indian suppose have heard nothing uncle a to seeing up to hour ago there be possibility of making out anything have not even be listening sam went on guard directly have finished supper asked to call in two hour did not wake until two o'clock be good fellow harry said well wake now ca leave kettle for have to keep boiling water going can put tin into ash warm up when wake here be couple of piece of bread why do have to keep kettle boiling uncle to bend wood with piece be working on be kept damp with boiling water hold for time over fire pouring little water on a fast a evaporates that softens wood can bend much more evenly than must if did by force besides when be fastened into position remains when be dry in shape throw strain on to anything be getting on well capitally must have done frame by now be obliged to make very strong so a to resist bump be sure to get against rock when be finished might almost let drop off top of house will be so strong elastic if indian will give time will make first rate job of three hour later harry came up again with kettle cooked meat sam have just woke up be quite angry with tom for not rousing before others have be working night said here have be asleep for five hour nice sort of mate will think well be watching five hour sam must deal rather work night than stand here for two hour in dark wondering time whether indian be crawling up expecting at moment to hear rush against wall be going to take place sam when have finished breakfast harry said a came up if ute found out last night that have gone scout may be coming down before long rifle shoot bit straighter than yours doe ai rifle harry sam said good temperedly be eye be wrong not shooting iron never have much practice with long gun when come to six shooter reckon can do share a well a most wo give chance with hope wo sam be sure wo a long a there be light hope that before get dark will conclude to leave alone vigilant watch be kept now think saw head look out from corner tom exclaimed suddenly two hour after sam have left be quite sure did tom must wait until show bit more reckon be good three hundred yard off man head be precious small mark at distance stand bit higher lay rifle on wall fire if only put head out know can shoot so there be not occasion to give lesson hold to killing unless have got to do let have good look at when go back tell tribe that there be three hundred yard straight passage without shelter strong wall across end of two white men with rifle ready to shoot reckon will know good deal better than to try to come up a long a there be light besides wo think there be occasion to hurry for wo count on taking to river will know that will be keeping watch at night so may very well be that will reckon on wearing out that may not hear of for week there be fellow head again head remained visible round corner of rock for two three minute know about now tom wo see more of to day will go down lend hand below tom asked question about horse have thought of score of time a stood on guard thought have occurred to that be possible shot have heard while be building wall on previous afternoon have be death shot of horse did not occur to when sam be telling story about bear that be got up tale when came to think over thought probable that be so sam be not much of shot although inferior to harry of two indian shot a well a jerry must hardly have missed bear three four time running time thought of horse occurred to resolutely put aside concentrated mind upon probable peril of passage down canyon wonderful gorge must traverse adventure excitement be sure to pas through thought how fortunate be have taken precaution of sending specimen of quartz back to fort for be in canoe fruit of journey must be irrevocably lost be to upset for now indian have twice discovered presence of white in valley must be sure to watch closely must not be possible to go up to mine again unless in strong force day passed quietly harry brought up tom meal late in afternoon hand came up wall of stone be raised four foot making almost impregnable against sudden attack two indian took post there with tom watched alternately night ute however remained perfectly quiet probably felt sure that fugitive must sooner later be forced to surrender be disinclined to face loss must occur before so strong position defended by seven men armed with rifle revolver must be carried at three o'clock on following afternoon hunting dog came up tom go down get dinner said hunting dog will watch tom took rifle started down canyon come on lad uncle shouted be pretty near ready for start have have dinner so be quick about want to get well away from here before night tom went to fire ate meal a sat down saw that store blanket robe have be carried away when finished uncle led down to river two canoe be floating in water other men be standing beside there tom what do think of be splendid uncle seems impossible that can have built in two day five hand can do lot of canoe building in forty eight hour work tom canoe be indeed model of strength if not of beauty be about twenty foot long five foot wide two strong piece of pine two inch square ran along top of side one of same width inch deeper formed keel rib inch wide three quarter of inch thick be placed at interval of eighteen inch apart canoe be almost flat bottomed rib lay across keel be cut away to allow to lie flush in strong nail being driven in at point of junction being only nail used in boat construction rib ran straight out to almost full width of canoe be then turned sharp up end being lashed with thong of hide to upper stringer outside rib be lashed longitudinal wattle of tough wood about inch wide be placed inch apart extending over bottom halfway up side over be stretched skin five horse hide having be used for boat be very strongly sewed together by double row of thong overlap having before being sewed be smeared with melted fat cross piece of wood at top kept upper framework in place hair of skin be outward inner glistened with fat have be rubbed into be strong indeed tom said ought to stand anything uncle yes think must stand blow against rock if have cutting edge must just bound off a basket must of course be very heavy for canoe a wo have to carry more than weight of four men will draw little over couple of inch so of water be why made so wide must not get strength without weight a there be saying what willow there may be how close in place rock may come up to surface be obliged to build wide to get light draught see have made ten paddle so a to have spare one two in case of breakage have two spare hide so that will have mean of repairing damage tom said nothing about horse manufactured into boat a skin be there be not much to remind of pressed uncle hand said thank very much uncle mind so much now must not like to have seen before be right tom be case of necessity sam ben shot directly got here store be laid by boat being divided between so that cargo be in respect duplicate of other before tom came down have already be placed in boat with blanket thrown over have got gold suppose uncle may bet that did not leave behind there be half in boat bag be lashed to timber so that if there be upset can not get lost how be going have settled that two indian will go together rest in other boat indian know nothing of canoeing wo be of very much use know be accustomed to boat did rowing when be young man wish have couple of canadian indian with of half breed be up to sort of work with one in stern of canoe must be much le risky business going down rapid however doubt will get handy with paddle before long when everything be ready harry fired rifle in couple of minute hunting dog came running down others have already taken seat stepped into harry boat at once pushed off river be running smoothly here harry said directly get down little way will turn boat head up stream practise for bit must never do to get down into rough water before can use paddle fairly tom sat in bow of boat hunting dog be next to then came chief harry sat in stern paddle be much easier implement to manage for beginner than be oar be not long before found that must propel boat at fair rate in short time have passed end of shelf at mouth of canyon cliff on side rose a abruptly a did on other river be eighty yard wide will turn here harry said paddle up sha' do more than keep abreast of rock now for stream run fast though be so smooth found indeed that have to work hard to hold position now tom harry sang out be do steering know when want head to go to right must work paddle out from boat when want to go to left must dip in water rather farther out draw towards boat of course when have got paddle other side must do just contrary must sing out right left according a see rock ahead will steer with paddle behind have good deal more power over boat than have must depend upon for steering unless there be occasion for smart swerve at first two boat shot backwards forward across stream in very erratic way after hour practice steersman found amount of force required hour later harry thought that be competent to make start turning shot rapidly past cliff in couple of mile there be break in rock to left will land there harry said there be tree near water bush farther up will make camp there there be saying how far may have to go before get opportunity have done with ute for good can get sound night sleep if chief will start with hunting dog a soon a land will get thing ashore light fire maybe will be able to get bear for did not trouble to haul up canoe fastened by head rope be made from lariat to tree on shore daylight be beginning to fade a lighted fire time be lost before mixing dough be in readiness by time that there be sufficient glowing ember to stand pot in kettle be filled hung on tripod over fire in short time indian returned empty handed find bear chief said getting too dark to hunt to morrow morning try harry got up went to boat returned directly with joint of meat tom looked up in surprise be not from yours tom jerry said a saw looking at took hind quarter of four pack pony left others alone be use bringing more for must not keep so be horseflesh tom rather shrank from idea of eating nothing must have induced to touch have thought that came from own favourite steak be cut placed in frying pan while strip be hung over fire for who preferred meat in way tom felt strongly inclined to refuse altogether when saw that others took meat a matter of course proceeded to eat with good appetite did not like to do so hesitated however before tasting harry said with laugh fire away tom can hardly tell from beef say that in paris lot of horseflesh be sold a beef thus encouraged tom took mouthful found by mean bad for from long stay in valley animal be in excellent condition acknowledged to that must not have known flesh from beef call mighty good for change terry said out on plain where one can get buffalo one must not take horse for choice a have be eating deer bear meat for about year horse meat ai bad by mean what wo take bit tom not to night jerry next time will be right be first trial know though ca say be not good give queer feeling so will stick to bread well boy harry said presently have made first rate start have got out of big scrape easier than ever looked for must not have got two better canoe for work if have have brought special from canada seems to that ought to go down pretty near anywhere without much damage will get real handy with paddle in two three day hope sha' meet with big rapid until have got into way of managing well bet harry have got out well said jerry tell looked downright ugly must have given continental for chance a for rapid guess will generally find rock one side other where can make way along can let down canoe by rope anyhow need not get skeery over after getting out of valley with hair on thought of doe not trouble cent chapter xvi afloat in canoe two indian be off long before daylight just a others be having wash at edge of river heard crack of rifle distance up cliff bear jerry exclaimed reckon have got else must have heard shot directly afterwards will set up in food for time get fire made up tom wo have to eat horse steak for breakfast unless like indian returned hour later laden with a much bear flesh a must carry vote stop here for two day harry said have got lot of meat now wo keep for twenty four hour in heat so vote cut up dry a indian do buffalo meat will keep time besides deserve couple of day rest can practise paddling while meat dry got on very well yesterday do want to get quite at home in boat before get to bad bit proposal be agreed to a soon a breakfast be over whole of meat be cut up into thin slice hung up on cord fastened from tree to tree ought to take three day to do properly four be better harry said still a have cut very thin must think two day in hot sun ought to be enough be there fish in river uncle have doubt there be tom grist of have got hook jerry have got told never travelled without caught lot of fish with up in mountain just after started before know about line one might unravel one of rope think might do better than tom next small animal shoot might make line from gut need be above five six foot long beyond must cut strip of thirty forty foot long from one of hide however can hing at present in way now let get into canoe have couple of hour paddling after dinner will have good spell at work by evening there be marked improvement in paddling over of previous day after having have day practice felt confident that must get on very well by nightfall on second day meat be found to be thoroughly dried be taken down packed in bundle next morning started a soon a be light be agreed that boat must follow other at distance of hundred yard so that leader must signal to one behind if serious difficulty be made out ahead so enable to row to bank in time be drawn together into suck of dangerous rapid might find without boat store whereas if only one of boat be broken up there must be other to fall back upon harry boat be to take lead on first day tom a knelt in bow felt heart beat with excitement at thought of unknown lay before that be about to make way down pass probably unpenetrated by man passing between have seemed to entrance to narrow canyon be surprised to rind river widen out on right great sweep of hill bent round like vast amphitheatre resemblance being heightened by ledge running in regular line along cliff being far from perpendicular must think one must climb up there tom said half turning round to uncle look like tom there be saying of step may be good deal steeper than look however have doubt one must find place where must be possible to climb if there be use in doing so a must only find up on bad land must gain nothing by mean must want to climb up now uncle seemed sort of satisfaction to know that there be place where one must climb in case got boat smashed up if have to make way up lad must be much better to go by one of lateral canyon like one came down by can see at least dozen of going up there must certainly find water might find game up on plateau must find one other on left hand bank of river cliff fell still farther back in wide terrace rose one behind other up to perpendicular cliff mile back from river there be shade of green here there chief pointed far up hill exclaimed deer that be good harry said there be sure to be more of place must think be not likely to starve anyhow ca spare time to stop now want to have long day paddle to see what be going to be like have got meat enough for present if happen to see deer within rifle shot so that can get at without much loss of time will stop for after fresh meat be better eating than dry must think must be uncle tom said from look of stuff must think must be quite a tough a shoe leather a tasteless need set of sharp teeth tom if be hard set have doubt will be able to get through at rate constitutes chief food of indian between missouri rockies for next three hour paddled along on quiet surface of river other canoe have drawn up since be evident that here at least there be reason why must keep apart did expect must find a quiet a harry jerry curtis said be regular water party must not mind how long be at if be like will have rough water enough presently jerry expect will look back on a pleasantest part of trip seems to that hill close in more towards end of sweep have made regular horseshoe reckon depends upon nature of rock ben put in be may be sure ben wherever be soft rock in time crumbles away like where be hard weather affect much get straight cliff expect be there will find rapid worst well will soon make trial of fancy look like wall ahead road must go through somewhere quarter of hour later harry said have better drop back now jerry there be gap right ahead if see hold up paddle row ashore when come to bad rapid have better get out make way down on rock a far a can to see what be like will never do to go at blind of course may find place where water come to wall face on side then there be nothing to do to take chance propose to run risk can avoid there be perceptible increase in rate of current a neared gorge when came within short distance of gave signal to boat behind canoe made for shore a stepped out on to rock chief pointed to ledge far above there will be time for hunting dog to shoot deer said while go down to see canyon tom in vain endeavoured to make out object at indian be pointing hunting dog have evidently noticed before landing upon harry giving nod of assent started off with rifle others waited until jerry companion joined then started along rock have fallen at foot of cliff be soon able to obtain far better view of gorge than have done from canoe river ran for bit in smooth glassy flood short distance down began to form into wave beyond must see mass of white foam breaker made way along rock for nearly two mile seemed well nigh impossible to tom that boat must go down without being swamped for wave be eight ten foot high with steep side capped with white at last gorge widened again although cliff to right rose perpendicularly on other side became le steep seemed lower down to assume same character a above gorge look pretty bad harry said speaking for almost first time since have started for roar of water against rock echoed re echoed by cliff rendered conversation impossibility look bad a far a can see there be rock come up near surface canoe ought to go through broken water safely enough be fired nasty looking place jerry said have heard men who have be in north talk about rapid have gone through from what said about must have be worse than have got to keep a near side a can wave ai a high there a be in middle have got to keep boat head straight to paddle know if do reckon canoe will go through retraced step up gorge hunting dog be standing by boat with dead deer at foot jerry picked up have better take reckon harry have got one man more than have two companion went on to boat now what do think tom uncle said can trust head to keep cool will need lot of nerve can tell if head swerve in slightest will swing round over will go must want tall swimming to get out of race paddle a well a chief better think chief nerve be like iron have not be practising steering a have a there seem to be rock about wo matter so much ought to be able to keep straight if three paddle hard may need turn of paddle now then in bow that ca tell so will be just a like lad if think nerve can stand take usual place if have doubt about be best to let chief go there think must stand uncle for have be out in wherry in precious rough sea at spithead think must be best for chief to take place time then will see how feel harry said few word to chief in own language leaping horse without word stepped into bow while tom took seat behind sha' be long going down harry said stream be running ten mile hour a will be paddling will take through in ten minute have better sit farther aft so a to take bow right out of water will go through ever so much easier so shifted seat until daylight must be seen under keel foot from bow think be about right trim harry said now paddle boat shot off from shore minute later darted into gorge indian setting long sweeping stroke there be two three long heave then dashed into race tom held breath at first wall of water buoyant lightly laden a canoe be with fully foot of free board rose like feather over darted down into hollow beyond tom kept eye fixed on back of chief head clinched teeth tightly paddled away with strength felt that be to look round must turn giddy at turmoil of water once twice be vaguely conscious of harry shout keep head inshore little farther out like man rowing race heeded word little faculty be concentrated on work must see slight swerve of indian body when be obeying order be not conscious of change of motion in boat in water round when harry shouted easy even then be chief ceasing to paddle rather than harry shout caused to stop then looked round saw that race be passed that canoe be floating in comparatively quiet water be daisy harry shouted must not do better if have be all canadian half breed chief now have better set to bale out a quickly a can tom now for first time perceived that be kneeling in water that boat be nearly half full tea pannikin have be laid by side in readiness hunting dog touched passed forward tin chief of have be swept aft seneca at once began to throw out water tom for minute two be unable to follow example felt a weak a child nervous quivering ran through body hand trembled so that must not grasp handle of tin feel bad tom uncle asked cheerily from behind brace up lad be pretty warm ten minute be not surprised feel now be over be little shaky will be right presently uncle look at chief back did more to steady tom nerve than own effort while be panting heavily be bathed in perspiration chief breath came so quietly that must scarce see shoulder rise fall a baled out water with perfect unconcern with effort boy took hold of dipper by time boat be empty nerve be gaining steadiness though breath still came quickly a laid down tin looked round heap water hunting dog said with smile run like herd of buffalo other boat lay twenty yard behind be also engaged in baling right now tom right uncle be lucky put chief in bow must have made mess of for from time got into wave seemed nothing confusion though heard voice did not seem to understand what said be trial to nerve tom will get accustomed to before get through well thank god have made first run safely now paddle on will stop at first likely place have meal mile farther saw pile of drift wood on left bank harry at once headed canoe to drawing boat carefully alongside got out minute later other canoe joined jee hoshaphat harry jerry exclaimed a stepped out that be worse cyclone must rather sit on back of worst kind of bucker than jump over wave again if be going to have much of must say let find way back ask ute to finish off be rough bit jerry might have be deal worse if there have be rock in stream have to do be to keep straight paddle pretty big too jerry grumbled felt skeered pretty nigh out of wit other two allow be just a bad if have be for boat ahead reckon must never have gone through a long a kept on straight there did seem reason why must tell feel so shaky that if there be grizzly twenty yard off be blamed if must keep muzzle of rifle on tom have be feeling good deal ashamed of nervousness be much relieved at hearing that seasoned men have felt somewhat same a have done what do say boy harry asked when breakfast have be cooked eaten if stop here for to day likely enough may get game if not wo matter for deer will last couple of day bet ben gulston said think have have enough of water for to day feel quite sure now ai going round round think of will feel right till have have night sleep besides rug blanket be wet want spreading out in sun for bit flour will want overhauling that settle ben let get outfit out of boat at once after thing have be laid out to dry two indian went off in search of game none of others felt inclination to move spent rest of day lying about smoking dozing indian brought back big horn next morning canoe dropped down stream again for mile river flowed quietly along wide valley at end of time made abrupt turn entered heart of mountain a before harry canoe went in advance canyon be here deep gloomy chasm with almost perpendicular side for distance river ran swiftly smoothly then white water be seen ahead so two boat rowed in to rock at foot of precipice occupant proceeded to explore pas ahead be of different character to last black rock rose everywhere above surface among river flowed with extraordinary force rapidity foaming roaring agreed that be madness to think of descending here that portage be necessary content of boat be lifted out then one of be carried down over rock by united strength of party have gone mile when came to spot where must go no farther a water rushed along against rock wall fifty yard further down must see that ledge again began must go fetch other boat harry shouted above din of water let down one by one there be other way to do second boat be brought down journey be made to bring down store lariat be then tied together let sit down smoke pipe before do anything more jerry said three time up down rock be worse thirty mile on level be glad to adopt suggestion for hour sat watching rushing water a did so discussed how have better divide force agreed that harry boat must a before go down first three men must be required to let boat down must need at least four to check second boat when came abreast of although felt certain that single line of plaited hide must be sufficient determined to use two line to ensure against risk must let run out fast at first jerry only keeping enough strain on to keep head well up stream begin to check gradually let down only inch by inch when see be close to rock hold there while get alongside leave go till lift from water directly be out fasten rope to bow of canoe then launch carefully do let go of rope launch stern first close to wall then two get in get well towards stern while other hold rope until last moment then two in boat must begin to paddle a hard a can while last man jump in snatch up paddle keep head close to wall for if current catch take round must capsize in moment against rock paddle know will haul in rope a fast a come down when come abreast two of will check others will be on rock to catch hold of side a swing in first canoe be launched stern foremost four men took seat in began to paddle against stream with strength while jerry companion let line run through finger boat glanced along by side of wall men above put on more more strain giving turn of rope round smooth water worn rock have before picked out a suitable for purpose water surged against bow of canoe lifting higher higher a full strain of rope came upon chief be kneeling in stern facing rock below a canoe came abreast of brought in alongside harry held up paddle men above gave turn of rope round rock canoe remained stationary hunting dog sprang out on to rock taking hold of blade of chief paddle brought canoe in so close that others be able to step ashore without difficulty baggage be taken out canoe lifted from water turned upside down laid on rock harry held up hand to show that be ready having before did so chosen stone round to wind lariat other boat be then launched sam ben took place astern began to paddle against stream a be in back water below ledge of rock be able to keep stationary while jerry took place got out paddle when be ready paddled out from back water a soon a current caught flew past cliff like arrow although three men be now paddling at top of speed harry chief pulled in rope hand over hand while hunting dog tom went short way down rock check too suddenly chief harry shouted rope run out easy at first bring strain on gradually rope will hold chief said one stop buffalo in gallop two stop boat yes must pull head out of canoe chief if stopped too suddenly chief nodded have not thought of in spite of effort of oarsman canoe head be swerving across stream just a came abreast of moment later felt check of rope easy chief easy harry shouted a water shot up high over bow of canoe wait till get bit lower will capsize check of bow have caused stern to swerve out when again checked be several length below with head inclined to shore more more strain be put on rope until be a taut a iron bar moment later tom hunting dog seized two paddle held out to boat came gently in alongside gosh ben exclaimed a stepped ashore have taken a much out of a working windlass for day be blamed if did not think hull boat be coming to piece thought be over with for sure harry when first felt rope water came in right over side be touch go ben there be rock just outside if have not checked bit head must have gone across if have must not have given red cent for life day toiled on foot by nightfall have made four mile then camped for night among rock next four day be passed in similar labour two three time have to cross torrent in order to get on to fallen rock on other side to be following passage demanded greatest caution in case there be rock showing above water in middle of channel one of be chosen a most suited to purpose by mean of rope canoe be sheered out to occupant then took place on rock in turn dropped other boat down to next suitable point process being repeated step by step until opposite bank be reached at end of fourth day geological formation changed rock be softer stream have worn more even path for decided to take to boat again there be occasion for paddling now be only when swell on surface marked hidden danger below stroke two of paddle be needed to sweep clear of for four hour be carried along at rate of fully twelve mile hour at end of time shot out from between overhanging wall into comparatively broad valley with shout of delight headed boat for shore leapt out on to flat rock few inch above water if must go on at pace right down must not be long before be out of mountain tom said must do with bit slower tom be too fast to be pleasant just about must do six mile hour twelve hour day must take out of canyon in fortnight so might do safely must not calculate on having such good luck a have have to day when going along at twelve mile hour pace for last four day have be just a much too slow a be too fast four mile day working from morning till night be heart breaking in spite of run to day can not have made much over hundred mile since started well there be one comfort be in great hurry have got just boat for work so far a can see be likely to find plenty of food job like be to be reckoned child play so far consider have have good luck will be well content if average a well way down fear be may get to fall where can carry let boat down in case must have to get out of canyon somewhere pack a much flour a must carry make way across country though how far might have to travel there be knowing hope may come to at rate must rather go through even worse place than canyon above than have to quit boat right be harry jerry agreed must rather tote canoe on back way down to mexico than have to try make way over bad land to hill besides when get bit farther will be in navahoe country ute ai sarcumstance to ute ai much of fighter anyway will kill white men find up in hill 'cause want white men there have to be five six to one before will attack navahoe kill white man 'cause be white man 'cause like killing be fighter forget if have be navaho instead of ute have caught up in hill may bet bottom dollar scalp must be drying in lodge now be so jerry ben put in besides navaho apache have got fear of white men have be raiding mexico for hundred of year man to man can whip mexikins out of boot say a have considerable respect for western hunter have have good many lesson that can out shoot out fight still ai scared of a plain indian be be bad lot look at way will want to have to tramp across country noways be pretty hard work carrying that boat along rock must rather have to do so right down to plain then get into mus with navaho how far doe navahoe country come way there ai fence tom expect reckon a be country just a far a like to come come up a far north a where end where ute begin one know reckon shift according a navaho be busy with mexican in south have got quiet spell take into head to hunt way for many day continued journey sometimes floating quietly along comparatively wide valley sometimes carrying boat past dangerous rapid sometimes rushing along at great speed on black deep water occasionally meeting with fall where everything have to be taken out of canoe boat allowed to shoot over fall with long rope attached by be drawn to shore lower down be seldom that be without meat a several big horn two bear be shot by indian have doubt that must have caught fish a rule be too tired when arrived at halting place to do more than cook eat supper before lay down to rest reckon wo be very long before come upon mexican village harry said one day after have be six week on downward course have heard there be one above grand canyon scenery have varied greatly in of valley grove of tree bordered river sometimes not even tuft of grass be to be seen occasionally cliff ran in even line for many mile showing that country beyond be level plateau at other time rugged peak pinnacle resembling ruined castle lighthouse church must be seen frequently cliff rose three four thousand foot in almost unbroken line more often there be rounded terrace where must have be easy to ascend to upper level everywhere various stratum be of different colour soft gray brown orange vermilion purple green yellow soon learned that when passed through soft stratum river ran quietly where rock be hard there be fall rapid where stratum lay stream ran smoothly though often with great rapidity where dipped up stream there be dangerous rapid fall since start river have be largely swollen by junction of other stream be much wider deeper than have be where embarked even where rapid be fiercest generally found comparatively quiet water close to bank on one side other twice have have upset boat having be capsized by striking upon rock inch two below surface of water little harm be done for gun other valuable article be lashed to side of boat while strip of hide zigzagged across end of canoe at short distance apart prevented blanket rug other bulky article from dropping out when boat capsized since river have become wider danger le frequent boat always kept near other upset be therefore only occasion for hearty laugh for took few minute to right canoe bale out proceed on way occasionally have unpleasant visitor at camp altogether killed ten twelve rattle snake in of valley found remains of dwelling of people far anterior to present indian race of ruin appeared to have be communal house at other point saw cliff dwelling in face of rock with rough sculpture hieroglyphic canyon varied in length from ten to hundred fifty mile comparatively flat country between varying equally in point of appearance in nature of rock a got lower once twice saw roughly made raft composed of three four log of wood showing where indian have crossed river journey so far have be much more pleasant than have expected for a river grew wider danger be fewer farther apart more easily avoided looked forward to descent of grand canyon from knew must not be far distant without much fear that must prove impracticable chapter xvii grand canyon passing from short canyon boat emerged into valley with flat shore for distance from river on right be wide side canyon might afford passage up into hill mile lower down there be tree sign of cultivation light smoke rose among at first sign of human life have seen since took to boat hand paddled rapidly be approaching shore when leaping horse said to harry go close stop in river see perhaps bad indian leaping horse not like smoke harry called to other canoe bore out into stream again chief stood up in boat after gazing at shore silently for moment said village burnt burnt little time ago post still burning a resumed seat harry stood up in turn be so chief there have only be five six hut whether indian white one ca tell now just at moment indian appeared on bank a eye fell on boat started moment later raised war yell navahoe chief said navahoe war party come down kill people burn village must row hard yell have be answered from wood in two three minute a many score of indian appeared on bank shouted to boat to come to shore a attention be paid of at once opened fire river be about quarter of mile wide although shot splashed round boat be not long in reaching farther bank not unharmed for ben have dropped paddle fallen back in boat be badly hurt harry asked anxiously a canoe drew alongside other near bank sam turned round to look at comrade have finished journey sam said in hoarse voice have gone down better mate truer heart never met ball have hit in middle of forehead be to be guess for must only have be chance shot at distance exclamation of sorrow fury broke from others for few minute there be thought of indian whose bullet be still falling in water for most part short of boat sharp tap on side of harry canoe followed by jet of water roused must stop here harry said a hunting dog plugged hole with piece of dried meat poor ben wo be only one let have shot first jerry said young tom do take shot with plumb centre be about four hundred fifty yard a near a can reckon will carry pretty true that distance will give shot round harry said a took up rifle six shot be discharged almost at same moment one of indian be seen to fall rest bounded away to short distance from bank then hunting dog at word from chief stepped into other canoe keeping close under bank paddled down indian have ceased firing have disappeared at run be up to now chief going down to mouth of canyon river sure to be narrow get there before wait jerry harry shouted to other boat be twenty yard ahead chief think have gone to cut off at head of canyon be likely enough suppose be fifty yard wide there will riddle if try to get through in daylight have better stop have meal talk over boat be rowed ashore men landed proceeded to light fire a unconcernedly a if danger threatened ben death have cast heavy gloom over few word be spoken until meal be cooked eaten be dog goned bad business jerry said say at night a may get past without being hit to go rushing into one of canyon in dark must be a bad a standing fire if not wuss question be must leave boat strike across must not strike across side anyhow harry said there be settlement west of colorado know nothing of country be hundred to one must die of thirst even if must carry enough grub to last if land at must be on other side then must not reckon on striking settlement short of two hundred mile two hundred mile across country like must be almost certain death a navaho must have ridden down harry there must be water reckon came down that canyon opposite navahoe on track in morning chief said quietly when see not go down river look for boat find where land take up trail canyon very plain road go up there straight take scalp one spoke for moment two what seneca said be so evident to that be useless to argue well chief what do advise harry asked at length not possible go on foot harry country rock canyon can not get through can not get water trouble with navaho too only chance get down in boat to night keep close under bank perhaps indian not see night dark do think can cross over to side yes got canoe two canoe in village leaping horse saw on bank when get dark cross over will get start of harry said directly be dark can be off too shore be everywhere higher than head a sit in canoe can paddle in shadow without being seen by on other side while wo venture to cross till be pitch dark a stream run something like three mile hour reckon that be hardly likely to catch a for rapid often begin until be little distance in at rate will not have to go far for red skin will not dare to enter canyon so can tie up till morning a soon a be short distance in have got to run gauntlet of fire after be better than taking chance by leaving boat if lie down when get near may not see at if do very few stroke will send past at rate there seems le risk in plan than in other others agreed now boy let dig grave went on a soon a point be settled be sort of clay here can manage be not likely will find place when be once in canyon where can do have pick shovel with for mining tool have be left at spot where be at work with ax knife dug willow grave laid ben body in covered up then rolled number of boulder over ben death affected tom greatly have lived together gone through many peril risk for nearly year none have shown more unflagging good humour throughout than man who have be killed that boat might upset might perish together be thought have often occurred to a made way down river that one must be cut off like have never once be contemplated by life from hour met on big wind river have seemed bound up together sudden loss of one of party affected greatly others went about work silently sadly have be so accustomed to see life lost in sudden fray in one other of many danger that miner hunter be exposed to that did not affect to same extent a did tom except two three men who remained on watch on opposite bank though carefully keeping out of rifle range saw sign of navaho during day a soon a became so dark that be sure movement must not be seen from other side silently took place in boat pushed off into current for quarter of hour lay in canoe then at signal from harry knelt up took paddle began to row very quietly cautiously necessity for dropping paddle noiselessly into water for avoiding splashing having be impressed on before starting there be occasion for haste harry said long gentle stroke of paddle will take down a fast a need go if fellow do cross over a expect will will find difficult to travel over rock in dark a fast a be going now there be fear whatever of catching if go on steadily after hour rowing must make out dark mass rising like wall in front of harry passed word back to other canoe be just behind that must now cease paddling only giving stroke occasionally to keep head of canoe straight to prevent boat from drifting out from under shelter of bank in stillness of night must hear low roaring knew that be caused by rapid in canyon ahead higher higher rose wall of rock blotting out star in front of till darkness seemed to spread half way over sky must see that boat be passing shore more rapidly a river accelerated course before rushing into gorge suddenly there be shout on right so close that tom be startled then there be rifle shot moment later wild outburst of yell dozen other shot at first shout paddle dipped into water at racing speed boat shot along eight ten more rifle shot be fired farther behind anyone hurt harry asked there be general negative believe really saw harry said first fellow may have caught sight of expect others fired merely at random now let row in fasten up for judging from that roaring there must be big rapid close ahead boat be soon fastened up against rock chief stepped ashore saying leaping horse hunting dog will watch navaho may come down here think will be brave enough to enter canyon too dark to see still better watch just a like chief harry said have belief that will come down here in dark must be a much a must dare do in broad daylight besides rock be steepish climbing anyway must not like to try to get over when be so dark that ca see own hand except by putting up between eye star if be not for jerry said must crawl along to mouth see if must get shot at varmint on other side must not find there jerry may be sure that when saw go through must know be of use waiting there longer must flatter that have hit of even if have must not seem to matter cent to a evil spirit of canyon must surely swallow up well have be wrong in first supposition uncle tom said hope will be equally wrong in second hope so tom now may a well go to sleep a soon a there be light must explore a far a can go for by noise ahead must be fall desperately bad rapid when daylight broke white found hunting dog sitting with rifle across knee on rock above where be chief harry asked leaping horse went up rock to see if navaho have gone very well tell when come back have gone down to have look at rapid tom may a well stay here there be plenty of drift wood among rock will breakfast before start down reckon will not have much time for anything of sort after be once off tom be by mean sorry to be saved heavy climb collected wood broke up into suitable piece at suggestion of hunting dog waited for chief return before lighting chief came down in few minute navaho gone said briefly then can light fire chief leaping horse nodded tom took out tightly fitting tin box in kept match of party carried box to secure against possibility of match being injured by water in case of capsize box be kept in deer bladder tightly tied at mouth fire be just alight when others returned be better ahead than expected harry said noise be caused by echo from smooth face of rock be lucky hauled in here last night for rock end fifty yard on a far a can see down water wash foot of wall on side be able to climb up from on to narrow ledge parallel with water went on to next turn there be change in character of river so will make fair start anyway more wood be put on fire in quarter of hour kettle be boiling slice of meat cooked hour later took place in canoe started canyon be similar to one have last passed wall be steep high with irregular shelf running along above be steep slope running up to foot of smooth perpendicular cliff of limestone stream be very rapid calculated that in first hour must have run six mile here wall receded to distance ledge of rock hill of considerable height intervened between river cliff checked pace of canoe just a reached opening for deep roar told of danger ahead fortunately there be rock where be able to disembark short way below found that natural dam extended across river there have be eruption of trap here harry said looking at black rock on side there have be fissure suppose lava be squeezed up through see river have cut path for hundred of foot deep must have taken countless age tom to have done work over dam water flowed swiftly smoothly then shot down in fall six foot high below for distance of two three hundred yard be furious rapid water running among black rock with considerable difficulty made portage of boat store to lower end of rapid transit occupied several hour then proceeded on way five more mile be passed several time boat be brought to bank in order fall ahead might be examined proved to be not too high to shoot boat paddled over when have first taken to river must never have dreamt of shooting such fall have now become so expert in management of boat so confident in buoyancy that danger must then have appalled be now faced without uneasiness now came to long rapid presenting so many danger that deemed advisable to let down boat by line again embarking found that wall of rock closed in entered narrow gorge through river ran with great swiftness touching wall on side great care be needed to prevent boat being dashed against rock succeeded in keeping fairly in middle of stream after travelling four mile through gorge opened somewhat on one side be strip of sand will land there harry said look to like granite ahead if be be in for bad time sure boat be soon pulled up proceeded to examine cliff below danger have be in almost exact proportion to hardness of rock a be entering far harder rock than have before encountered greater difficulty than have surmounted be to be expected must not see long distance down what saw be enough to justify worst anticipation canyon be narrower than have traversed current extremely swift there seemed few broken rock in channel on side wall jutted out in sharp angle far into river with crag pinnacle waal be of use looking at jerry said after pause be certain ca get along side so there be nothing to do to go straight at sooner be over better accordingly returned to boat soon darted at speed of arrow into race bad a be at starting speedily became worse ledge pinnacle tower of rock rose above surface of stream breaking into fall whirlpool moment seemed to tom that boat must inevitably be dashed to piece against one of obstruction for light boat be whirled about like feather on torrent paddler must do little to guide course very strength of torrent however saved from destruction whirl from rock sweeping boat head aside when within few foot of driving past danger before have time to realize that have escaped wreck hour of side canyon came in down vast quantity of boulder have be swept forming dam across river managed to paddle into eddy at side to make portage of boat to water below dam over there be fall of from thirty to forty foot high three more similar dam be met with over one canoe be carried on others there be break in boulder wall be able to shoot fall after three day of incessant labour heard soon after starting from last halting place roar even louder more menacing than have yet experienced cautiously got a close a possible to side paddling against stream be able to effect landing just above rapid on examining found that be nearly mile long in distance water made fall of eighty foot stream being broken everywhere with ledge jagged rock among wave lashed into white foam seemed madness to attempt descent agreed that at rate must halt for day rock through canyon ran be fully thousand foot high decided that great a labour might be must be better to make portage if possible rather than descend cataract there be gulch here running up on to hill tom said hunting dog will start at once see if be possible to get up if so how far be to place where can get down again harry assented leaping horse without word joined explorer set off up gulch be found that ravine be steep not too steep to climb when be nearly at top hunting dog pointed to hillside above saw big horn standing at edge of rock three fired rifle simultaneously wild sheep made spring into air then came tumbling down side of ravine a fresh meat be beginning to run short be stroke of good fortune after reloading gun proceeded up ravine until reached crest of hill soil be disintegrated granite tuft of short grass grew here there after walking about mile parallel to course of river found that ground descended again without much difficulty made way down until reached foot of little valley following be soon standing by side of river above surface be a closely studded with rock a be upper cataract below there be fall looked impracticable except that seemed possible to pas along on rock by side be getting dark by time rejoined comrade report be not very cheerful one harry said at rate there seems nothing else to be done than to make portage meat have got for will re stock larder a be up there sha' have trouble of carrying over next day be laborious one one by one canoe be carried over operation took from daybreak till dark next morning journey be made to bring over rug store be able in addition to to carry down carcass of sheep after first skinning cutting off head with great horn nothing be done for rest of day beyond trying whether portage must be made be found to be impracticable there be nothing for to attempt descent breakfasted a soon a day broke carried boat down over boulder dam with rapid commenced put into water for little distance be able to let down by rope then rock at foot of cliff came to end fortunately seven lariat furnished with considerable length of line in addition to two indian have on way down plaited considerable length of rope with thong cut from skin of animal have killed total available amount of rope be now divided into two length end being fastened to canoe one of boat with crew on board be lowered to point where men be able to get foothold on ledge a soon a have done so other boat dropped down to rope be played out until be in turn enabled to get footing on similar ledge jutting rock sometimes so narrow that one man be able to stand so alternately boat be let down sometimes when foothold must be obtained on rock pinnacle ledge in stream be utilized work have to be done by gesture for thunder of water be so tremendous that loudest shout must not be heard few yard away hour passed after hour progress be extremely slow a step have to be closely considered carried out with greatest care at last terrible accident happened harry leaping horse tom be on ledge below be fall of three foot in foaming stream below rose several jagged rock jerry canoe be got safely down fall in spite of effort of rower be carried against outer side of one of rock made great effort to turn boat head into eddy behind a line touched rock sharp edge severed rope like knife boat shot away down rapid on ledge watched with breathless anxiety two three danger be safely passed then to horror saw head of canoe rise suddenly a ran up sunken ledge just under water instant later stern swept round bringing broadside on to stream at once capsized quick harry exclaimed must go to rescue keep close to wall chief till see sign of be safest close in in instant be in place a released canoe shot in moment over fall for short distance kept close to side projecting ledge threw current sharply outwards canoe shot out into full force of rapid chief knelt up in bow paddle in hand keeping vigilant eye for rock ledge ahead often with sharp stroke of paddle seconded by effort of harry in stern sweeping aside just when tom thought destruction inevitable now went headlong down fall then be caught by eddy be whirled round round three four time before effort of paddler must take beyond influence suddenly cry came to ear just a approached rocky ledge thirty foot long showing saw like edge foot above water chief gave shout struck paddle into water behind rock tom behind rock harry exclaimed a swept stern round tom paddled with might canoe headed up stream quickly a movement be done boat be twelve yard below rock a came round with nose just in lower edge of eddy behind while from side current closed in on straining nerve three paddler worked a for life at first tom thought that glancing water must sweep down inch by inch gained drove boat forward from grasp of current into back eddy until suddenly a if released from vice sprang forward never in life have tom exerted so greatly eye be fixed on rock in front of where hunting dog be clinging with one hand while with other supported jerry head above water gave shout of joy a chief swept head of canoe round just a touched rock laid broadside to stick paddle between two point of rock tom harry shouted

lose keep eye open chief again boat moved down stream with four paddle going steersman have somewhat more control over a flew down seething water glanced past rock sprang over fall tom expected to capsize moment at last saw below stretch of quiet water two three minute later be floating upon a if by common impulse ceased rowing thanks be to god for having preserved harry said reverently be half full of water five minute of work must have be over with do see sign of canoe chief chief pointed to ledge of rock extending out into stream canoe there said paddled across to after what young indian
