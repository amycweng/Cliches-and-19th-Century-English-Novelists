pirate escape be not one however to blame captain certainly arab have acted under great provocation knew that have be in captain place must have yielded to solicitation of lady especially a seemed that death of culprit be a certain a if slower than by rope must vastly have preferred to have seen man hung recognized how dangerous enemy be a soon a heard of escape became anxious about safety of

information a to starting in pursuit of otherwise there must surely have be hesitation when first saw consultation whether must attack not unless be greatly mistaken one of ship be dordrecht be only three week at batavia fellow must have lost time in getting ally among native prince in order to waylay when came out again must be first object of vengeance certainly look like other agreed well if so there be one more debt to be paid off captain be good old fellow liked second mate very much hope of fell before vessel be seized for may be sure that must not have have easy death if be captured will be tough fight for have doubt that boat be crammed with men there be one thing expect have many gun except in two ship counting only fifty men boat doubt many of carry hundred will be tremendously outnumbered if get alongside yes be little unfortunate that there be not more wind then might keep away from boat pepper hotly a be can move three foot to one a soon a pirate be within range three dutch vessel opened fire be unanswered for short time for two pirate ship have be outstripped by prahs several of latter now took in tow presently began to return fire with bow gun although several of prahs be sunk so badly damaged that have to drop behind others pressed on at signal from commander of ship of war consort now brought head round so that lay nearly in line with broadside to pirate with loud shout beating of drum blowing of horn prahs came along at racing speed instead of using round shot gun be now crammed to muzzle with bag of bullet did terrible execution malay did not relax effort presently dashed alongside of dutch ship soon desperate fight took place soldier kept up incessant musketry fire a fast a must load sailor cut down who attempted to board malay threw shower of spear stink pot missile of kind for hour fight continued result be still in doubt when there be crash deck be swept by storm of bullet scarce noticed while struggle be going on two pirate ship have come up passed ahead of dutch vessel have sailed close up on opposite side to on fight with prahs be taking place pirate have shifted gun so a to bear on dutch vessel mounted sixteen cannon poured in content simultaneously effect be terrible more than defender be swept away minute later pirate ship be alongside a dutch turned to repel storm of figure leaping on to deck men in canoe crowded up on other side dutch soldier sailor fought with desperation knew there be quarter held out to last in five minute ship of war one next to have be captured last of defender slain ship carried van houten be at end of line have up to now be only attacked by native few of sailor be withdrawn from work of defence of bulwark be ordered to haul on sheet so that sail might catch what wind there be if must escape from attack of two ship might yet beat off native be too late pirate threw off grapnel attached to ship have captured again of canoe took in tow several of be sunk way given be sufficient leading vessel ranged alongside merchantman exultant shout of malay rose high in air a men from pirate ship prahs swarmed on deck dutch soldier held together fought steadily number lessened fast a spear of malay flew among few of have time to reload musket fire second shot erasmus fell by van houten side when latter have dozen men left around leader of pirate whom now recognized shouted touch that white officer make prisoner want moment later there be general rush of malay three of sprang upon van houten dragged to ground soon yell of triumph told that last of defender have fallen van houten be now allowed to rise to foot arm still clasped by assailant why kill scoundrel same a others said to pirate will be killed soon enough arab said want to keep for while just to have pleasure of showing that girl in hand be not good enough to look at thought good not will be mine settled on that first moment saw bind tightly take below be sure that cord be tight tie to mast will have pleasure of looking at talking to sometimes then gave number of order prize crew be told off to three captured vessel remaining prahs took five ship in tow in body moved away six hour rowing brought to narrow inlet here be native village two of men be placed a guard over van houten work of emptying ship of valuable then began continued until late at night everything being taken ashore by boat three day passed in feasting rejoicing prisoner arm be unbound so that must eat food given at regular interval guard be changed two hour pirate came round day to taunt captive even have guard be removed latter must not have freed for rope round leg chest be tied round other side of mast must not therefore possibly get at knot on third evening van houten saw that one at least of two men who came on guard be worse for liquor grumbled loudly at being brought off from pleasure on shore to look after white prisoner however said have brought off gourd have better be careful other said if captain came off found drunk must shoot like dog bah went into hut hour ago wo be out again to night besides be not going to get drunk be just comfortable be nevertheless warning have effect man only took small sip from gourd van houten let chin drop on breast a if asleep presently man a passed in front of lurched against in moment van houten snatched one of knife from girdle hid beneath coat other guard be standing few pace away watching shore action be unnoticed feeling for first time since have be captured that there be hope young soldier now went off to sleep thing have not be able to do before owing to tightness of bond when woke sun be just rising guard have be twice changed day passed a before that evening boat pushed off to various ship early next morning be towed out of inlet boat be not to accompany returned to village slowly clumsily sail be hoisted five vessel crowded with malay set sail van houten have be carried evening before to warship of pirate captain have taken command be a before tied to mast be fastened in sitting position on deck instead of standing one wish to die yet man said giving kick want to be so sleepy that will be stupid want to be able to take in change be intense relief for five day have be kept standing at time leg refused to bear weight have be supported entirely by rope round body dropped almost instantaneously asleep when pirate left sun be high next day before awoke for time neck be so stiff from position have slept in almost cried out from pain a lifted have be dreaming that be in dungeon of spanish inquisition that be being tortured for moment must scarce understand where be for pain of tightly bound rope seemed to be part of dream four day passed be no longer strictly guarded for escape in mid ocean be impossible nevertheless knot of rope be examined two three time day a have be case all along be liberated from bond for five minute four time day four of malay keeping close to to prevent from jumping overboard early one afternoon western extremity of sumatra be made out after fleet have passed through narrow strait between island island of banca headed south keeping close inshore towards strait of sunda a van houten when have taken last walk before became dark saw ship head be pointed south thought that from course be taking must strike island of java early next morning thirty mile to west of batavia have doubt be thinking pirate said to coldly that people on shore will see in morning take alarm there be fear of before be light two ship have before will make way to sea again will have dutch flag flying will sail along two mile so from coast of course will be recognized a pas batavia authority will suppose that fleet have not come upon vessel be in search of having obtained news that be likely to attempt landing on island farther to east be now coasting along in hope of falling in with bold plan be not by evening will be back again off meyers plantation by nightfall will have beauty on board will have be already joined by consort will sail together to batavia artilleryman in fort will think have made capture during night will get in without shot being fired at at same time party have landed will attack place on land side then will sack burn town attack fort from land side where be weak kill artilleryman carry off such gun a choose after that will have wedding will witness if can not get minister to perform will manage to do without one will then be taken on board ship while superintend roasting on bonfire be programme what do think of van houten have stared stolidly astern while pirate be speaking latter apparently not expecting answer to question with mocking laugh turned away a soon a have become quite dark boat have be lowered pirate have gone on board other vessel to give order prisoner listened eagerly for return if boat be pulled up seemed to that last chance of escape be gone for cramped a be by long confinement felt sure must not be able to swim ashore almost held breath a heard returning to ship side there be such appliance a now exist for raising boat to get one of clumsy heavy boat on deck be work of small labour pirate sprung on deck gave order to men in boat a prisoner did not understand malay be ignorant of purport when four men who have be rowing came on deck one of holding boat painter in hand walked astern with felt sure that be to be allowed to tow there at rate till morning after ship have be put on course parallel with shore there be soon silence on board there be moon star be bright vessel moved along with gentle breeze about three knot hour evening guard of two men have again be posted over prisoner for certain a captain felt that escape be impossible thought must be a well to neglect precaution now that land be near malay seemed to consider that guard be altogether unnecessary after talk between one lay down between gun while other took up place by mast leant against close to van latter waited for hour until felt that other guard be asleep then taking out knife cut cord slight noise a fell aroused sentry on guard half asleep a leant against mast stooped down so a to assure that be right van houten seized throat with one hand with other drove knife up to hilt into there be need to repeat blow have be driven through heart noiselessly van houten lowered to deck then moving little on one side propped up body against mast in attitude in have be bound after taking off shoe made way astern malay be lying thickly between gun on side be sound asleep reaching ladder up to lofty poop climbed there be malay here except man at wheel be so intent on work that did not notice van houten a crept past found boat rope be tied to rail lowered till be in water boat be ten yard astern severing rope be soon alongside keeping hand on gunwale worked along till reached stern grasped hung on boat soon lost way ship receded fast made effort to climb into boat until latter have quite disappeared from sight for have in climbing on board moved one of oar in rattle might have be heard by someone sleeping lightly on ship once assured that be well away cautiously raised clambered over stern using utmost care in movement so a to avoid touching anything movable waited quarter of hour then crept forward took off coat cut off one of sleeve fastened round one of heavy oar put out over stern so that cloth be in groove made for purpose of enabling one man to scull when near shore must prevent slightest chance of pirate hearing at work found terribly hard at first so sore be body from pressure of rope gradually however a warmed to work became able to put out strength star being sufficient guide to enable to make way straight to shore have fear of being overtaken even if escape be speedily discovered for must not be able to tell how long time have elapsed since got away thought probable however that escape must not be discovered until morning other malay must have slept till be roused by comrade must not be likely to wake until day broke when must discover change have be effected heavy boat moved slowly be not until good hour after leaving ship that made out shore fortunately breeze during afternoon have be good one so pirate have passed strait of sunda at nine o'clock have then changed course to east what wind there be be from north so helped two hour after leaving ship reached shore have fifty mile to go to batavia there must be plenty of time be certain that attack at station must not take place till following night knew plantation where colonist with whom be acquainted lived must not be more than two three mile away strength weakened by suffering mental torment be greatly diminished after walking for mile felt that must be better for to rest till morning broke when must be able to ascertain exactly where be find way to plantation accordingly lay down must not permit to doze a worn out a be from want of rest if did so might sleep far into day soon found that lying down must be impossible for to keep awake accordingly sat down by large rock in position to have become accustomed hour passed slowly have now difficulty in keeping awake be filled with exultation at escape at prospect of turning table upon pirate a soon a day broke struck inland for knew that road ran east west by various product of land be taken to town in hour came upon after following for mile came upon plantation fence arriving at gate entered made way up to house there be already movement there group of native labourer be receiving order from overseer who looked in astonishment at appearance of officer haggard blistered by sun whose uniform be still wet one sleeve altogether missing be station of meinheer de koning be not van houten asked be sir be not up yet be bearer of important news must see at once will order one of servant to arouse tell lieutenant van houten desire to see instantly on matter of most pressing importance in five minute planter came down philip have met several time in batavia latter gazed at in surprise failing at first to recognize figure before a smart young officer of acquaintance be just escaped from one of ship of beea tiger ' who with four vessel beside own be on way to attack batavia unless can arrive there in time to warn will do terrible damage way be ship going de koning asked in consternation be going east five ship be crowded with malay reckon upon destroying town overrunning whole country beg of that will at once lend good horse look fit to ride five mile much le fifty will have two horse put into vehicle drive in meantime come in take glass of wine bread will have basket of provision put in trap for to eat a go along in quarter of hour light vehicle drawn by two horse drew up to door philip who felt refreshed strengthened by wine at once clambered up planter took rein started on way philip told story of event have gone through so scoundrel captured ship of war two consort wonder think that with five ship crowded a say with men can take batavia basket contained good supply of provision fruit philip be able to make hearty meal after diet of bread water on have lived for last ten day planter have lent doublet have put on in place of uniform coat therefore attracted attention when after six hour drive arrived at batavia went straight to governor house latter on hearing philip story summoned member of council military commander after discussion plan of action be decided upon troop in garrison be to march to meyers plantation be to take with six light gun crier went round town summoning inhabitant to gather in market place here governor told news that have received then explained plan of operation artillery be to remain here to man gun of fort in case pirate must change plan one company of soldier be also to stay behind to oppose landing in first place beg that having vehicle will place at disposal will be used to carry troop out to meyers station then if troop hear firing here will know that pirate have changed plan will be brought back to town with speed so that in little over hour after first gun be fired will be here ready to help in defence in next place be important for safety of island town that heavy blow will be dealt pirate there be now four merchant ship in harbour number of native boat trust that man capable of bearing arm will volunteer to man will remain here member of council have decided to go in boat think probable that by far greater portion of malay will land attempt to capture meyers plantation with intention of afterwards marching upon town attacking on land side if do ship will naturally be feebly manned have decided to adopt suggestion made by lieutenant van houten who have be in hand of pirate have escaped from that a soon a fight begin on shore attention of pirate on board be fixed on struggle will be attacked on other side by flotilla of boat attack will be chiefly directed against ship of war be sorry to say have captured carry heavier gun than others be fast sailer therefore when be once taken gun can be turned on others hope will all be recaptured officer crew of merchant ship here will aid in attack have a great interest a have in destruction will be able to work gun if be successful will at one blow destroy power of terrible pirate beea tiger render sea open again to commerce captain smidt one of council who be a know distinguished naval officer have volunteered to take command of expedition will lead boat to attack will also arrange crew of boat beg that will all inscribe name a ready to fight for home family possession of will be in grievous danger unless pirate be crushed at seven o'clock evening who have volunteered will assemble at fort boat will be in readiness with number painted on so that when be told off will be able one to take place without confusion in allotted boat in one other of ship pirate will make landing about eleven o'clock boat will row till within three mile of then will be taken in tow by ship sound of boat oar must be heard for long way on still night will probably get quite close to before be seen moment alarm be given tow rope must be thrown off ship will fire broadside into man of war at once range alongside boat will attack other pirate speech be received in silence save that hearty shout arose when governor called upon to volunteer captain smidt be already at town hall said go there register name in order that may know how many boat will be required will be able to make arrangement accordingly cordon of troop have be placed round town one will be allowed to leave without permit of native might if knew preparation have be made make off swim to pirate ship with news a ceased speaking little crowd moved off towards town hall mounted men be at once despatched to plantation within fifteen mile calling upon planter to drive in instantly with arm for defence of town be menaced by attack from pirate at four o'clock in afternoon three vessel have left there ten day before be seen sailing past town must have be sighted hour earlier shortly after daybreak wind have fallen calm have lasted till midday be flying dutch flag hauled down in salute to flying on fort proceeded on way without changing course everything be apparently quiet in fort salute be duly returned boat sufficient to carry number of men available have by time be drawn up close to shore bearing number painted on bow at half past six townspeople began to gather be armed with musket rifle pike sword quietly without confusion took allotted place on boat on two ship troop have marched hour before joined by between forty fifty men who came in from plantation van houten have gone with halted mile from station be desirable that must not come up until native labourer be asleep van houten rode on be nearly nine o'clock a entered be greeted by cry of joy surprise from planter daughter why philip exclaimed how have got here saw three vessel come along just a became dark hour ago suppose must have landed a passed batavia what be matter look strangely ill have be wounded in fight with pirate do look strange father added be not in uniform thing have gone badly replied three vessel have be captured be sole survivor of crew have be prisoner only escaped last night then what be three ship saw planter said must have sworn to man of war leyden be not sure a to other two ship be full of pirate meinheer have probably be joined by two more ship by time be going to land at about eleven o'clock to burn place down carry daughter off after will storm sack batavia be in earnest van houten dreaming if news be true there be not moment to be lost must have horse trap round at once drive inland to batavia town can successfully resist must certainly advise elise to retire at once to station mile two away there will be battle fought here two hundred soldier forty fifty planter with six gun halted mile away will be here in hour time will give malay reception that dream of a soon a fight begin ship will be attacked by two merchantman flotilla of boat manned by available man in batavia with exception of governor small garrison who will remain in fort to protect town must pirate change plan captain smidt be in command of flotilla colonel stern be with troop be startling news indeed planter said after moment silence say will not attack till eleven will have horse put in at once will take elise to neighbour rogen whose house be three mile inland will be back again in plenty of time to take part in affair will drive there van houten dare say that must like to do so thank sir can not stay here dear father said decisively might be hit by chance shot want to be in state of anxiety about while have other thing to do rang bell standing on table servant entered in first place go tell domingo to put horse into carriage at once to bring round to door then bring in glass bottle of rhine wine ten minute later van houten started with elise native driving on way gave sketch of have happened since went away told of plan of sea tiger girl shuddered from what fate have saved murmured must not have be so for must have killed think that must have given much opportunity for doing that said that must take good care that weapon must be put in way however thank god that scheme have be thwarted by own folly in torturing by telling of intention need have fear of result of fight taken wholly by surprise a will be bewildered by attack on ship be certain to defeat on land trust that will capture ship lesson will be so terrible that will be long time before other be likely to follow beea tiger ' example on arriving at planter house found that son have ridden into batavia at four o'clock in obedience to governor call wife daughter be glad to have elise with leaving to tell story philip drove back to father column arrived three minute after return colonel went round ground with van houten planter house stood three hundred yard from shore ground slanting gradually down from there be plantation on side four of gun be placed under broad verandah with five twenty men who be to work rest be distributed among shrubbery on side of open space running down from house towards water where must take pirate a advanced in flank van houten offered to take ten of planter down to destroy boat when malay have left ten of colonist volunteered for service be provided from storehouse with ax for staving in board posted in clump of bush close to shore quarter of hour passed then heard five loud splash confused noise knew that pirate ship have anchored then came creaking of pulley grating sound knew that boat have be lowered light in house have be extinguished perfect silence reigned presently there be sound of many oar beat of paddle five minute later ten large boat crowded with men appeared making for shore in few minute grating of keel be heard on sand dark figure must be seen making way up beach there must be three hundred of at least van houten said to man who be standing next to fancy about same number remain on board a far a can make out there be only one two men left on guard at boat will creep up a quietly a can directly firing break out of will pick off man noise will not be noticed in row will be going on up above then let two go to boat stave in couple of plank then go along do same with others see that be done thoroughly directly boat be damaged hurry back here open fire upon pirate a return trace have be fastened to gun artilleryman will run down towards water edge soldier will advance surround scoundrel a strive to push boat off not one of must be able to regain ship pirate be led by man whose white dress showed up clearly in darkness who van houten be sure be sea tiger advanced towards house in irregular line two flank rather in advance sound be heard among be evident that have be ordered to preserve silence until house be surrounded went on on until must be no longer seen by watcher

people be able to concentrate attention upon subject of missing cashier few said that have always suspected that something be wrong be people who be always wise after event majority admitted frankly that there be nothing in william partridge antecedent behaviour must warrant shadow of suspicion a to probity be not altogether popular man be what people of brownsville called high in notion be to say did not care about mixing much in general society being intimate only with small circle of friend there be nothing indeed in mr partridge way of living must not have be warranted by salary be known to draw lived in pretty house just outside town certainly spent more money than neighbour in keeping garden bright with flower never entertained on large scale dinner be choice small kept equipage have expensive taste reputation indeed be that of somewhat retiring man with higher degree of culture education than most of neighbour with quiet refined manner studious taste thing however must not have prevented from being seized with demon speculation for many man apparently a quiet a refined have ruined that way verdict of brownsville be unanimous that must have become involved in extensive speculation have failed signally to bolster up must have taken bank fund security hoping to be able to replace at next turn of luck everyone agreed that greatest credit be due to president whose vigilance astuteness have detected defalcation before have reached point must have proved ruinous to bank shareholder depositor mr james johnstone have always be popular personage in brownsville be never so popular a upon occasion deputation of shareholder depositor waited upon to express thanks for vigilance watchfulness although mr johnstone did not say much led to understand that have reason to be grateful for thing must very shortly have be in very bad way have not be for interposition president be tall man just sufficiently inclined to stoutness to add to appearance of respectability solvency be smoothly shaven wore gold eye glass looked director inch while cashier never attended public gathering on scientific political sordid subject president be always prominent figure at never however took leading part on side appeared rather in character of arbitrator speech be always pleasing to party throwing oil on troubled water be large subscriber to local charity although belonged to baptist persuasion made distinction between various creed in distribution of alms such being case when brownsville once realized fact that own saving be in jeopardy sympathy with banker for annoyance trouble that occurrence must cause became very great matter be discussed in light at tea table in brownsville even formed principal topic of conversation among number of young people who be preparing school room for festivity be to take place on following evening what be to be done about roland partridge lilla fairfax girl of sixteen year of age asked during pause in buzz of conversation of course wo have bad taste to show face here percy johnstone president son replied see that cissie white girl who have however taken part in conversation have be sitting in corner undisturbed manufacturing wreath said warmly be not to blame for fault of father bravo cissie percy johnstone said in sneering voice be a well that must know what valiant champion have see have scriptural authority for saying child must suffer for fault of father be not meant in way girl retorted think very mean of to talk so suppose think because roland partridge be to suffer for fault of father that be great man because of numerous virtue of yours there be general laugh for percy johnstone be known to give to inconsiderable extent on account of social position of banker coloured hotly at reply laughter followed found answer ready at hand really lilla fairfax said ought to decide what be to do about roland partridge see that there be necessity for quarrelling over have got to discus must not be quite pleasant know for to be coming amongst just a if nothing have happened must not like cissie must not like what cissie white asked shortly well must not like to go out sleighing with for example must certainly go out sleighing with if asked cissie answered quietly indeed did ask two day ago said yes if come to fetch will certainly go now be not likely to jane simmonds eldest girl present said be not likely to cissie agreed have other thing to think about only say that if doe come will keep engagement quite right cissie tom fernlea said heartily like friend who be friend not mere fair weather bird there be better fellow going than roland may not be quite so brilliant a fellow glanced at percy doe not go out of own way to make popular prefer good straightforward earnest fellow must almost back against brownsville there be good many people percy johnstone said coldly who must perhaps have said a much two day ago for father perhaps may change opinion one of day be not likely to change opinion of at rate tom replied hotly be pretty strong one can tell everyone know that never liked roland because always beat in class be better baseball player better skater better fellow round than be oh dear oh dear lilla fairfax exclaimed plaintively be quarrelling about have come here to make decoration for to morrow demon of discord seems to have entered in vote girl that next person who quarrel whoever may be will be unanimously expelled from society there be chorus of assent jane simmonds dexterously changed conversation by asking whether arrangement have quite be settled for programme of following evening be easy however to see during rest of meeting le interest than usual be taken in various discussion that thought of most of young people be otherwise occupied little whispered conference went on before broke up opinion of most of present be ascertained be found to be pretty equally divided a to advisability otherwise of treating roland partridge just a if father have still be occupying position of cashier at bank while conversation have be going on subject of be pacing up down sitting room at home discussing matter with mother roland have few day before gone over to stay for week with uncle who lived twenty mile away have that morning received telegram from mother begging to return at once be not until reached home in evening that heard terrible news be impossible mother absolutely impossible that father can have done thing be what say roland father be last man in world to do thing never speculated a far a know mother roland be quite sure that did be quite contented with position wanted nothing more have often heard say that one connected with bank have right to engage in business outside what did say mother surely must have said something when left last night came in about half past nine roland have be staying late at bank week making up book be a pale a death lip be trembling must hardly speak when begged to tell be matter with said a nearly a can remember word terrible thing have happened must go away at once bank have be robbed ' what have to do with william ' asked be accused of doing ' said almost laughed seemed so absurd went on 'appearances be terribly against be mystery to if stay will be arrested to morrow morning surely condemned must not stand must kill must go there be other way will write to tell what to do when can think over ca think now be in such nervous state that be useless to speak to indeed be so stunned with news must think of nothing did say 'it must be far better for to stay william face out innocence be sure to be proved only shook head repeated ' must go ' so hurried to get few thing together for moment have done so be off to catch train think be five minute in house altogether be not till have gone be able to think clearly what have happened be not blaming mother dear roland said tenderly be most unfortunate that father must have acted a did know perfectly well that be innocent running away will of course convince everyone else that be guilty must have be thousand time better to have braved out however strong circumstance might be that point against so think of course roland know what father be naturally understand even better than do have only known since be prosperous respected here in early day of marriage when be still struggling young man learnt will not say fault son weakness of character be a know man of strict nay of extreme honour integrity be sensitive almost to fault have self assertion very little self confidence be just man in fact to bend before storm rather than brave although may greatly lament be not bit surprised that when suddenly confronted with terrible accusation a seeing a say that circumstance be altogether against must abandon field without struggle rather than face storm of public obloquy indignation roland be silent knew how father shrunk from anything like public turmoil how easily upset be by trifle must scarcely have noticed although have never acknowledged a much to have even when much younger be vaguely conscious that father be lacking in force of character there be disinclination to find fault shrinking from unpleasantness avoidance even of argument desire that everything must go on with clock like regularity that nothing must disturb even tenor of life seemed to show constitutional avoidance of effort struggle still a roland have a mother said only seen father under circumstance of ease comfort must not tell how far be innate defect in character until now showed so disastrously know where have gone to mother said at length because if have slightest idea a to locality will start at once to try find to persuade to return circumstance may be against must be thousand time better to brave out than by running away to make what can not appear tacit confession of guilt now mother dear what do intend to do be what be wanting to talk to about roland seems to that best thing to do will be to give up house at once to sell furniture then in meantime if hear from father to move right away to place where will not be known where can earn little money by needle perhaps can obtain situation of sort mother roland said decidedly quite agree with a to giving up house selling furniture go away will not father may have given up battle in despair will stay fight out know that did not take money be for to find out who did so if go away matter can never be cleared up so long a remain here there be chance of striking on clue other will be dreadful mr partridge began will be horribly painful roland agreed awful to have to meet old friend know that regard one a son of swindler have to be done mother for only so can hope to prove that father be honest man ask to stay mother be quite sure that uncle will be glad for to go live with at farm be saying only yesterday that have be dull life for since aunt have gone no boy must not do mr partridge said must not leave here to bear burden alone think unkind mother when say must rather that must think must bear changed face of old friend so long a slight affect only must suffer ten time more in seeing suffer therefore mother do think that plan be best hope that will not be for very long till matter be made clear will be best for to stay with uncle must run over from time to time to see tell how be getting on at rate roland there be occasion to decide for few day first thing to do be to get rid of house sell furniture when be done can talk matter over again next morning roland called upon landlord asked if must take house off hand at once landlord willingly agreed to do be indeed well pleased with proposition have already be wondering how mr partridge intended to manage lease have still two year to run did not see how must be able to pay rent have that morning received application from gentleman who be willing to take house if must obtain possession at once roland proposal to move out at end of week exactly suited after settling matter roland went to auctioneer arranged that notice must at once be issued of immediate sale of furniture returned home well pleased with success of mission a far a be concerned mother think thing will be better than expected see there be difference of opinion in brownsville have met several people know well morning of just gave nod a much a to say see want to speak to others nodded a if must have liked to have stopped chatted with be rather afraid to do so while tom fernlea two other fellow came up shook hand just a heartily a usual asked when came back from uncle what have be doing so on a if nothing have happened at rate mother thing like give one opportunity of finding out of friend be worth having be not there be certain indication of bitterness in tone mother looked at little anxiously will not get cynical hope roland dear boy must remember that vast number of people act quite a much in accordance with what think other people will do a with own conviction be apt to be guided by opinion of world though seems hard that sin of parent must in degree be visited upon child must remember that child get benefit other way if boy girl father be rich popular man will be made more of than when not so situated of course be wrong everyone must be judged by doubt that eventually be case of course if one whom believed to be true friend fell away at time of trial must be proof that friendship be not true one must not be surprised if mere acquaintance go with stream direction may be be becoming quite philosopher little mother roland laughed at rate a said thing be better than expected of course be good doing anything for next day two shade passed over roland face a thought how widely christmas day must differ from anticipation of next week will go round see if can get something to do be not particular what be a long a enables to stay at brownsville chapter ii true friend late in afternoon roland went out to get few thing be required suddenly came on group of dozen girl who have just finished putting up decoration in school room first couple passed with bow cissie white who be walking next stopped with companion shook hand with how be roland have missed at decoration afternoon be sorry not to be able to come cissie roland said be sorry will not be able to keep engagement to go sleighing on th be very sorry too must have be so glad to have gone with if must have taken be afraid must not be able to want to tell roland hesitated know whether people talk about such thing be sure wo mind want to tell how sorry be about news have heard to say hope be not going to make difference to be afraid must make difference cissie roland answered thank very much for what have said want to tell that people may think mother know that father did not do thing that accuse of day hope to prove innocence be so glad to hear say so roland did seem impossible yet hesitated yet everyone said so put in unfortunately father be very nervous sensitive man thought of such charge made well nigh beside went away be not guilty for day will prove will please tell people people know mean not that father be innocent for might not believe that wife son be absolutely sure that be so will indeed roland be very very glad to hear what say may be sure that other people say in future will believe a tell good bye now again shaking hand warmly hurried away after companion who be waiting for at corner of next block what have found to talk about cissie must have stopped spoken too only must not think what must say told be sorry to hear news cissie said that hoped must not make difference to oh cissie mean to say alluded to how must chorus from others why not cissie asked knew that must be thinking about why must say be glad did for if have not spoken perhaps must not have alluded to matter told that other people might say mother be quite sure that mr partridge did not take money there be incredulous oh from hearer jane simmonds asked what did run away for then if be guilty because be sensitive must not stay to face accusation of course roland did not say that be foolish must see that thought that be awful pity must think be jane simmonds replied sarcastically of course wife son say think be innocent be only natural wo get anyone to believe be wrong for once jane cissie said quietly although know that must appear to to be quite impossible a happens believe entirely although be very insignificant person still be somebody that see upset sweeping assertion well dear jane simmonds replied if wish to retain reputation a sensible girl must advise to keep opinion to yourself unless indeed wish to set up a knowing more than anyone else in town will hing of sort cissie replied cassandra be looked upon a idiot know turned out to be right brownsville be welcome to entertain same opinion about be content that must think so till turn out to be right a will see will be case in end now must be off to tea sale came off on day arranged word have be received from mr partridge wife have hardly expected that must write so soon a knew have hundred dollar in possession when went away be under uneasiness respecting on morning of sale went to brother roland plan having finally be decided upon a best day before sale mr partridge received note from mr johnstone saying that must be glad to obtain position for son in mercantile house in new york to mr partridge replied that be greatly obliged thankful for offer that roland have quite made up mind that for present must remain in brownsville where hoped to obtain sort of occupation refusal be speedily known in brownsville percy johnstone spreading news everywhere excited surprise among displeasure among many think be wonderfully good of father percy told friend after trouble loss fellow father have caused to offer to put into situation must have thought that must have be only too glad to have got away from here be sure absence must have be relief to ca understand motif many others even among most favourably disposed towards roland be inclined to agree with percy continued presence in brownsville must be source of embarrassment trouble to who have previously be intimate with did seem strange that must prefer to live among people cognisant of father misdoings instead of taking opportunity offered of beginning life elsewhere mr johnstone conduct in interesting on behalf be considered kind in extreme still more surprise be excited when at meeting of director of bank called day two after beginning of new year after explaining amount of loss to bank said in reply to question that have not a yet offered reward for apprehension of fugitive have not indeed instructed police to take step in matter rumour to effect have already be current for police authority when interviewed on subject have declared that have instruction on matter be generally supposed that be mere official reticence intended to lull fugitive into security while be quietly working to arrest announcement of mr johnstone caused quite sensation among colleague must say mr johnstone one said angrily that course in matter appears to to be most extraordinary a did not call together at once naturally supposed that be taking necessary step partridge must in few day at latest be in hand of police now meet tell that have done nothing said in fact when wanted to go into question on morning after discovery of cashier flight one of suggested that hot pursuit must be at once set on foot that must safely leave matter in hand that have best confine attention to investigation of account several others spoke to same effect mr johnstone then rose with usual placid undisturbed aspect gentleman said in first place have not called together earlier because just at time of year man be occupied more le by family matter a did not seem to that there be extreme urgency in matter thought must allow to enjoy holiday undisturbed now a to main subject of remark namely have taken step to secure arrest of late cashier well gentleman be aware that in not doing so have assumed certain amount of responsibility certainly when met ten day since have intended to set police at work without delay for first twenty four hour however be so occupied with investigation into state of book may say with reassuring mind of depositor restoring confidence have really time to move in matter then gentleman came christmas with christmas thought christmas sermon christmas association said to myself man be undoubtedly thief defaulter how stand man must be punished gentleman for last fifteen year have be friend have be proud of a gentleman of singular culture most of have be intimate at house acquainted with wife one of most charming lady in section in year conduct have be above reproach although have have passing through hand fund of bank have up till now accounted for up to last penny there can be doubt that mania of speculation be bane of civilization seized upon unhappy man that in moment may say of temporary insanity laid hand upon bank fund to meet loss intending doubt to replace at earliest opportunity well gentleman that opportunity never came know usual sad story in case loss follows loss man becomes desperate until at last come inevitable discovery gentleman know that man who doe thing must be punished seemed to that punishment that law must allot must add very greatly to must be now suffering imagine gentleman man with refined taste habit skulking fugitive from justice perhaps by time half way across ocean knowing that can never raise head again in society of honest men there be nothing to gain for may be sure that money have long since passed out of hand feel that must do good be arrested tried everyone know now that bank have made loss be also satisfied that bank be solvent confidence be restored have avoided anything like run one indeed have idea how large loss really be outside board now gentleman if be to have trial real amount of loss must become known although ourselves may feel confident that can weather storm can in time pull round be by mean certain that public will take same view run have now be averted might then take place bank be compelled to shut door know gentleman that when come to forced realization of effect how far sum realized fall short of value placed upon how heavy call upon shareholder to make up deficiency well gentleman be large shareholder in bank now that ten day have elapsed have kept matter quiet ask be worth while to run risk of bringing ruin upon bank beggary upon shareholder merely for pleasure of knowing that defaulting cashier have got so many year of penal servitude put in light matter assumed very different appearance director knew well enough that although have put good face on matter loss did seriously compromise stability of bank that le matter be dragged before public better director looked at other in silence when mr johnstone concluded one said public will think most extraordinary thing that prosecute intend to prosecute mr johnstone said be distinctly understood be intention fact have come to knowledge leave doubt that cashier escaped into canada within few hour of leaving place be believed by time have crossed atlantic must ever return to country will of course be prosecuted at once on ground of public policy a duty to shareholder at same time have objection to being whispered abroad that although director must strictly carry out duty have opportunity be afforded be at heart by mean sorry for sake of man for of wife that have succeeded in escaping before hand of justice must be laid upon after further discussion view taken by president be unanimously approved of report that cashier be known to have escaped into canada have made way to europe that bank authority be convinced that have managed to take little with be not sorry that painful duty of prosecuting have be avoided be speedily spread through town unpleasantness former friend have anticipated from strange resolution of roland partridge to remain in brownsville be not experienced for never showed in old resort be seldom to be met with in street be known that have applied for several situation without success that be at present living in poor lodging in outskirt of place have seen roland partridge lately cissie white asked tom fernlea have have not seen since christmas eve have be to see tom know where life yes know have not be there yet have be meaning to go day what with sleighing party one thing have never found time then ought to have found cissie said indignantly did not think that be that sort of boy tom thought that must have stuck to friend be downright ashamed of well be ashamed of now that have put so though really do mean to stick to know have engagement evening will get out of go ought to have gone week since cissie said very little mollified call friend let amusement stand in way for ten day of going to see chum who be alone in trouble must not give fig for such friendship a well be staunch friend anyhow cissie tom said admiringly be not girl who must care to stick up for boy a do for roland why must stick up for asked scornfully mother mine be friend many pleasant afternoon have spent there why must girl stick up for friend a well a boy must like to know liked roland partridge better than of boy in set care who know say be scandalous being cut because father turned out badly even if did turn out badly believe oh come now cissie be too much somebody said that did not believe mr partridge be guilty put down to pure obstinacy well need not look angry about because like people who be obstinate for friend did not imagine that really must think so why must have right to thought tom fernlea suppose a well a have do think that roland partridge must tell lie be sure that must tom said year have known have never heard tell anything like untruth well then why must believe now say that mother be absolutely convinced that father be innocent suppose be quite a likely to know truth of matter a anyone in brownsville well cissie if roland say that must have ground for such statement anyhow will go to see evening need not tell suppose that sent if do will never speak to again tom fernlea so now know when tom called at roland lodging that evening be told that be out whereupon took post at door waited for hour when friend returned have come for chat said old fellow if will let in have be waiting for hour to see must have called before know how engaged fellow be just at time of year however be determined must come evening so threw over party at dawson here be be glad to see tom come in roland said quietly led way up to room lighted candle be looking pale out of sort old fellow said a saw roland face know have have awful lot to upset still be of use letting make ill be easy know for to talk went on a saw slight smile on roland face for be sure must be horribly cut up if be in position do think quite wise roland determination to stop here must have thought that must be only too glad to be away from say that refused offer mr johnstone made of situation in new york of course know own business best if have be in place must have jumped at well see tom depends how look at thing if thought father guilty must go right away quick enough a be sure that be not see stop yes cissie white be telling so afternoon roland heard before be saying so be not until told afternoon believed be quite in earnest will excuse saying so up till then have thought a other people do when said that have assured that mother be thoroughly convinced that father be innocent saw matter in entirely different light for know even on thing a must not say anything that did really believe in case mind asking why father went away mind asking at tom must much rather people spoke plainly what think instead of avoiding allusion to subject be away know when father went from what said to mother imagine that in way ca say how felt that circumstance be against that although be perfectly innocent be not in position to prove be very sensitive nervous man believe felt at moment that anything in world must be better than standing up before everyone who believed that be guilty think that be terrible mistake however can understand father whose disposition be entirely different from mine taking course did now believing a do that be victim of somebody else crime made up mind to stay here brave out in order that if be possible may find out who have done how be going to set about can not tell may say will watch everyone who be connected with bank possibly may obtain clue understand now roland quite agree with a to course be very glad that have told for before must not make out of course understand tom be for alone if real thief have idea that be being watched must make careful diminish chance have rather people thought that have stopped here from pure pig headed obstinacy have not got place yet have roland have applied for several situation have always met with refusal doubt people thought that be better away out of will speak to father if mind roland giving hint of what motif be old man be talker know used to like very much be sure will do what can for be there anything else that can do thing want to know roland said be if anyone connected with bank here have be speculating in new york know how to set about let see tom said thoughtfully know cousin arthur went away last year to broker office there of course know lot of clerk in other office now if mind writing to telling frankly about be sure will set to work heart soul in matter maybe will find out something roland eagerly agreed then for couple of hour lad sat chatting about school other matter when tom took leave felt that have cheered friend up done service chapter iii making start two day later tom fernlea again called on roland father say will look round to office to morrow morning did not tell exactly what wanted for expect be all right be very much interested in what told yesterday when old man take thing up generally carry through so expect there be something in wind what pity be roland did not see father before went away have be thinking over seems to that if have told whole circumstance must have be sure to have got clue to work upon be have thought hundred time tom hope that will hear from ere long may tell privately that be in canada mother have have two short note from be evidently in sadly depressed state say be well letter having canadian stamp on knew came from there say nothing about where be be doubt afraid that may be traced extradition demanded hope soon that will give address to can write to directly doe will send letter saying that be settled here be going to make business of life to prove innocence will implore to write to fully detail can respecting affair a story may give sort of clue a to real thief next morning roland presented at office of mr fernlea who be leading lawyer of town be at once shown into inner office glad to see roland have not be up at house with tom for last month have be talking to about business of father quite take view do have be puzzled over affair ever since first heard of father foolish flight deceived a well a rest of have doubt what say be correct that have be so badly scared that helped game of rascal who be real criminal by bolting however although may be opinion mine doe not advance case bit father by own act have so to speak pleaded guilty have be condemned sentenced accordingly by public opinion tell frankly that think be likely will ever obtain reversal of sentence still approve of resolution tom tell that have taken must not have nobler aim in life than to clear father name be ready to aid so far a to give seat in office here with salary of six dollar week no great thing enough to keep be unlikely to mind that will ever get clue will aid if must do will be most heartily glad to help with advice in other way in power have always high respect for father will be glad to assist for sake may say frankly will do so especially because be great friend of tom although be not particularly bright have think enough good sense to choose friend wisely indeed know now from own observation in instance have done so now what do say to offer be extremely obliged to sir be most kind of be far better than anything have hoped for be settled then may a well begin at once mr mullins will show what have to do roland be indeed glad at opening mr fernlea have made for utmost have hoped for be to obtain position in store a hitherto have be intended that must go to harvard at beginning of next term thought of entering store have gone somewhat against grain now with position in mr fernlea office might be considered not only to retain position occupied among school fellow friend to have taken first step in promising career when became known in brownsville that mr fernlea have taken roland partridge into office there be much surprise comment more than one leading man in place have made overture to lawyer for placing son with have always declined saying that found that mullins be able to get through work that did not care for trouble of teaching young bear there be general feeling among that lawyer have in sort of way done personal wrong by thus taking into office son of defaulter one whom have hoped must be obliged to leave place from inability to find employment there lawyer however be not man to concern with opinion of others must have be unconscious of comment decision have excited have not tom told laughing that have outraged feeling of old woman in place tom did not forget promise to write to cousin in new york to interest in search roland have undertaken did so effectually that received letter by return saying that writer must do anything must to aid old school fellow that must set enquiry on foot among acquaintance in broker office to find out if possible if resident in brownsville have lately be going into extensive speculation few day after roland have entered upon new duty mr fernlea called into office by way partridge said have be thinking over matter of yours with idea might perhaps hit upon clue upon might work have not done so for curious difficulty at once presented naturally occurred to that one of method to be first pursued be to find out through whose hand of stolen security have passed then to trace backwards when came to think of at once struck that list of security stolen have never be published be so singular so out of usual course yesterday spoke to one of director of bank who have come in to smoke cigar with said have be decided by board a fraud have extended over month a defaulter have got safely away to canada there be chance of being able to recover security by time have probably passed through dozen hand be thought better for credit of bank so on to let whole matter drop of course defaulter must be arrested at once if ever showed face in country again course director have taken strike a being very unusual one say that from point of view may not be very wise one loss may be heavier than people suppose may think better not to call further attention to may be that be policy in fact think perhaps be so still be certainly unusual angry men always take wisest course said a much to friend from what said gathered that have be to extent influenced by feeling of sympathy with mother by respect for father former position in place said that be view president took that fell in with be business to make remark changed subject must own more think over more unusual singular appears to doubt be influenced far more by thought of credit of bank than by sympathy with father mother must say that be glad be not large shareholder in bank still be curious at rate one result be that there be clue to be obtained from following up of missing security of course director know have be taken naturally will keep own council help be to be obtained in way now that be manifest that roland partridge be settled for good in little party who have from first taken side gained ground rapidly argument be indeed unanswerable now that be there be a well to make best of tom fernlea several others of set must anyhow stick to a must be met in company be of use pretending to ignore presence must indeed only cause unpleasantness disagreement consequently be decided with few dissentient voice headed by percy johnstone roland partridge must again be received into set a if nothing unpleasant have taken place accordingly received invitation to one of first party be got up showed to tom fernlea yes knew be coming tom said laughing have won along line of course will not go roland said of course will go tom replied make fool martyr of have happened be natural enough people thought father have got into scrape shareholder of bank considered that lost lot of money by be generally thought that must be leaving town naturally there be sort of awkwardness about joining in fun a usual nobody thought worse of for be of course not fault be simply awkwardness now that be going to stay matter have altered month have passed story have become old one everyone

precisely given address have given indication by letter must be addressed to under name not own roland night sat down wrote to at great length told that mother be convinced that be victim of misdoings that have determined that if be humanly possible must find out guilty party that before set about doing so with chance of success be absolutely necessary that must be in possession of fact of case implored to write fully frankly to giving detail however minute must bear upon concluded by saying dear father know how very painful to thought must be of appearing in light of suspected person in presence of who have known respected can not think that must have be better if have made effort faced out for innocence must sooner later have be proved however for sake of good name mother happiness be clearly incumbent on now to aid to utmost in effort to re establish good name even if to do so must have to come back demand trial however be not necessary now hope never will be first thing of be for to understand exactly what circumstance be have caused suspicion of crime to fall upon chapter iv clue week later roland received letter from father in answer to that have written content be a follows dear roland know that with young heart strong courage complete happy absence of nerve can not think weak cowardly of to run away instead of waiting fighting hard against circumstance know a well a anyone can tell that be course must have adopted score of time since came away have be on point of returning giving up time when have come to point have drawn back despised for cowardice can not overcome have unhappy childhood under stern father very unkind stepmother think that spirit ever have be frightened out of by time entered life shrinking sensitive young fellow conscious that possessed fair ability altogether unfit to fight own way for year life be very hard to failing increased rather than diminished then by good chance certainly from solicitation on part course opened before married mother firmness gave support love goodness brought happiness then when obtained post of cashier at bank of brownsville seemed that trial be over although must never bring to mix much with other men gained confidence in believed have grown out of extreme sensibility have rendered early year so unhappy when trial came upon suddenly found that be mistaken thought of standing before world accused of theft filled with overpowering fear rather than stay face must have put end to existence know that will scarcely understand feeling know that will think weak cowardly simply say boy can not help that can more withstand than madman can check impulse now have told so much son will tell of event of evening for day have be low out of sort haunting sense that something be wrong have be upon last clerk before leaving have a usual laid key on desk beside told must go a have hour work before for hour went through book then sudden impulse seized must examine of security see that none be missing took key went down to strong room thing never that can recall have done after bank be shut took out large parcel of share bond locked door again took up with to count in room compare with book have just set to work when latch key of front door turn minute later mr johnstone came in 'you be at work late partridge ' said ' saw light burning a be passing why hallo ' said with change of voice have got security up for be rather unusual be be strong room locked up before clerk went away have not struck that there be anything strange about tone of president voice showed that there be old nervousness seized a if with sudden grip have doubt that tone in explained reason for going down into strong room bringing up security added to suspicion however said coldly ' be not aware of anything must have excited suspicion that be not right induced to unlock strong room after bank be closed however a have brought up of security have nothing to do for next half hour will go through with ' sat down by side took book containing list of security held by bank read out number of bond york central of five hundred dollar ' presently said sharply 'that doe not tally with book ran eye down remarked 'there be fifty missing here running in successive number between last two read out ' 'perhaps be out of place said looked through rest of bond be not there 'how do account for ' president asked sharply ' can not account for ' said bewildered 'oh said in awkward tone particularly struck 'here be initial to figure showing that have be paid out when be redeemed ' looked at book there be initial sure enough bond have not be redeemed at be certain there be initial looked at thunderstruck ' have highest opinion of mr partridge ' president said must admit have very curious appearance here find have after bank have closed opened strong room have got of security up here find of be missing that book be initialled by so that anyone else going through with security must suppose that have be parted with in due course own manner if will excuse saying so strike a altogether suspicious however let go through more bundle that examined showed deficiency although have not brought up one tenth of bond security found deficiency of over hundred fifty thousand dollar when have done mr johnstone did not make single observation beyond briefly pointing out number of missing security added 'you see mr partridge have one course to follow bank have be robbed of immense amount how much a yet have mean of knowing find here with security brought out of strong room at unusual hour security be entirely in hand one touch can give explanation of deficiency in case initial be appended a proof that have be paid out in due course under such circumstance be duty to at once give into custody ' have be getting more nervous confused a fresh discovery be made horrible consciousness of position became stronger ' be innocent sir exclaimed 'before god be innocent 'in that case mr partridge will doubt be able to prove to satisfaction of jury in mind confess matter be clear book in entry be made be own private property keep presume in own safe here of one have key be not sort of book that be in habit of leaving about what have done with proceeds of bond know not that have taken seems to a clear a day of course matter may be explained in way hope that will be have worked here with for last fifteen year have hitherto not only have implicit confidence in respect liking must give anything to escape situation in be placed duty be clear must hand over to police 'it will kill ' said be innocent mr johnstone innocent a child disgrace of will kill ' be silent for time then said ' be sorry for mr partridge with heart still more sorry for wife money suppose be hopelessly gone in wild speculation again protested waved to to be silent 'and irretrievably lost for sake of long friendship of good lady wife will suffer to leave office free man will take step till morning more than will if possible keep affair out of hand of police for next twelve hour by time ought to be across frontier into canada be risking great deal in doing will do will satisfy colleague a well a can there let more be said go strive in future by life of strict honesty to justify course be taking ' murmured something whether of thanks protest know not seizing went out into air anyone who have noticed on way home must have thought drunk for know staggered blindly along mother will have told what happened when got home be tale roland make thing look very black against be at bank late having opened strong room taken out security president coming in finding so employed went through book with discovered large deficiency in security be never handled by anyone worst of in private book kept always under lock key be initial showing that be cognizant of security having be parted with lastly there be flight manner against in answer give bare protest that knew nothing about security being missing that though initial appear indeed to be own that certainly never signed though own that book be never to knowledge out of custody at time that safe in be kept be always locked up by of evening that somebody have taken security be clear also that somebody have got at book forged initial be only bare assertion have against fact seem to prove guilty be going west have made acquaintance of gentleman who have given letter to two three large store keeper in winnipeg where under name hope to obtain employment there trust mother will follow a for have told have be taken by mr fernlea into office trust in spite of terrible blot have brought upon name that will succeed have however hope that will be able to clear up mystery of be victim still will not dissuade from trying although can not hope will pray day night that success may attend effort roland read letter through through until have almost learnt by heart next morning took in to mr fernlea know what object be in remaining at brownsville mr fernlea must like to read letter have received from father need not say that will show to one else received yesterday evening have be thinking over night can not see that furnishes with clue such a have hoped may think differently mr fernlea read letter through to end then without word turned over re read frankly roland said when laid down be there impression left in mind after reading that letter well sir roland said hesitatingly seems too absurd can not think little strange that mr johnstone must let father go off like be mr fernlea said johnstone have reputation of being pleasant gentleman adverse to trouble contention desirous of keeping on good term with everyone have nevertheless be always sharp enough on creditor to bank have several time prosecuted when appeared that bank be victim of sharp practice have always wondered that attempt to discover arrest father be made when loss be first discovered be understood when johnstone examined bond on morning when father be found missing now that find knew before father left be still more surprising to that must have let go assumed a seems by letter father have spent proceeds of robbery why must assume that father might still have have great number of bond in hand by arresting at once considerable number of stolen security might have be recovered be not there be one very singular fact in story father be reading over number of bond when mr johnstone suddenly exclaimed 'that be wrong there be fifty bond missing between last two number read out where be ' why must have said that a take number of bond have hitherto be read corresponded with number of marked still in hand be to say of against initial have be placed seems that fifty be initialled what be there then to call johnstone attention to fact that must have be there be very remarkable to say least of roland clasped hand before oh fernlea do really think think anything roland mr fernlea said sharply mr johnstone be president of bank prominent citizen man of unblemished reputation simply say that fact stated together be singular think give clue how clue be to be followed up can not at present suggest simply affirm that be clue now want to take next train to chicago client of mine want enquiry made about house be thinking of purchasing here be paper connected with can study a go along of course will go to land office see if there be mortgage on will look up title roland reached chicago in afternoon where at once set about making necessary enquiry lawyer upon whom first called at once showed title appeared to to be correct of made abstract for mr fernlea inspection then went to land office found that mortgage be registered on house from there walked to address of owner found to be in small street house be shut up made enquiry carefully among neighbour found reputation of man be reverse of favourable be now getting late in afternoon rode to central telegraph office to send off short message to mr fernlea with result of enquiry two three person be writing message to surprise at once recognized in one of mr johnstone of brownsville there be nothing in least strange that banker must be at chicago hundred fifty mile from brownsville have not be that roland have be thinking of day meeting must not have given second thought a be drew back instantly took place at distant desk to write own message house mortgaged for dollar title apparently good vendor house shut up neighbour give bad account of wait instruction just a have finished mr johnstone turned from desk went up to pigeon hole handed in message question two be asked having paid money left roland at once went to same pigeon hole girl be in act of handing message have just received to operator be cipher what tiresome thing be one have to be so careful with there be sense to help one mine be not cipher roland said a handed in handwriting be not very clear one last message ought not to be difficult to make out for know mr johnstone writing be a clear a print johnstone girl said glancing back over other shoulder be johnstone be westerton roland felt thrill shoot through answered carelessly be be mistaken in man then thought knew hour later received telegram from mr fernlea in answer to that have sent simply said come back accordingly took night train to brownsville appeared at office a usual in morning have found out just what wanted to know partridge man be sort of acquaintance of client wanted to let have thousand dollar to day pending examination of title of course said nothing about mortgage already on house client believed be right must have advanced money have not begged to wait twenty four hour so trip have prevented from throwing away thousand dollar be very glad went sir on own account roland said for have made discovery may be of importance have found out that mr johnstone be in habit of going over to chicago despatching telegram there in name of westerton then related incident of telegraph office may be of importance mr fernlea said must not place too much importance upon may possibly have sent off message for friend still be clue so tom fernlea thought when roland told circumstance must get to write off again tom to cousin told two day ago so far have not found out among acquaintance that anyone here connected with bank be speculating thing now be to ask among if anyone know of mr westerton of chicago dealing in venture of sort chapter v fog clear week later tom brought roland letter have received from cousin dear tom plot begin to thicken think be on right scent be taking drink with other stock exchange men afternoon when said 'does anyone know westerton of chicago 'yes be client of ours one of replied 'he speculates pretty heavily in sort of stock have dropped lot of money last six month do know because if do be more than anyone in chicago seems to chief have asked lot of men there about one seems to know name of course doe not matter to because there be always ample cover so can not burn finger doe seem rum that man who can go in for such heavy speculation must not be known to anyone there ' 'no know ' said 'but man be asking about fancy speculates with too ' 'likely enough fellow always have two three agent think rather probable that be false name there be many man who dabbles in speculation that none of friend must ever believe did anything of sort such a clergyman merchant with solid business whose credit must be injured if men thought that speculated so on who be behind scene must astonish world if be to tell know ' however turned subject a did not want to suspect have particular interest in westerton so see tom first step be gained have found out that respectable president of brownsville bank speculates largely under assumed name know what partridge next move may be if can give further assistance can rely upon be going to do next tom said a closed letter have least idea tom at rate will consult father be something to learn a much a have certainly seem to have got on right clue never quite despaired feel now pretty certain that will get to bottom of at last will do percy johnstone world of good to take down conceit bit stuck up monkey say that tom felt so much that be sure must not wish worst enemy to go through thing wish percy johnstone particular ill roland if somebody have got to suffer must rather be than anyone else in insufferable air fellow give be disgusting mr fernlea be greatly interested when heard news have doubt whatever that be on right track now roland taking father letter point noticed when read fact know now that johnstone be heavy unsuccessful speculator seem to show without doubt that be real thief conduct in not arresting father at once in allowing without pursuit to get across frontier be accounted for now did not want anything like public trial for in case number of missing bond must have be made public might in way have be traced to have doubt that be thief question be how be to prove of course if johnstone go on at game continues to be unnoticed there will be smash up sooner later even then whole thing might not come out if father must come back here must be obliged to arrest even if denounced johnstone a real thief have nothing to go upon mere fact that have speculated must in be proof that did so under assumed name for must urge that many people do same that only adopted precaution because being in position of president of bank did not wish people here to know that dabbled in share own see what next step be to be seems to that must wait watch be what be thinking sir will kindly give leave to be away from office till be done must like to come here of morning go in out a if be in employment in case mr johnstone be watching be not likely must then suppose that be still working for went out rather frequently on errand certainly roland if want money let know anything that may require to carry matter through will be glad to let have thank sir hope will not be obliged to avail of kind offer mother still have proceeds of sale of furniture need hardly say how glad will be to spend if know that there be chance of proving father innocence roland now kept strict watch upon mr johnstone movement next time gentleman boarded train at brownsville roland did same got into third class compartment forward be close at hand however when banker presently took out ticket be only for town thirty mile out when train stopped at station banker ran into office procuring ticket for chicago continued journey to city when alighted there roland followed went to small house in retired quarter on knocking at door be admitted without question roland concluded that habitually stayed there came out in few minute without bag have carried in a soon a be fairly away roland seeing that there be notice in window that there be apartment to let knocked at door have room to let said can see certainly sir roland followed woman upstairs room will do very nicely said will not be troublesome lodger for be great deal away will only sleep here occasionally like to have place of own instead of always putting up at hotel be just case with lodger downstairs sir doe not often sleep here not more than one night in week travel believe for house of business a say like to have quiet place to come to when here be only other lodger hope roland said for above thing like quietness yes sir only let room be quiet enough when come here generally come in afternoon go out directly come back again at seven to dinner always go off at six o'clock in morning quieter gentleman one must wish to have for lodger than mr westerton roland at once agreed to take room paying deposit said that must come on following day to take possession name be rowlands be not likely that anyone will come to enquire for having watched mr johnstone off by first train in morning roland went to lodging where soon became friendly with landlady who be quite ready to gossip be full of praise for other lodger expect have got good situation said money seem of consequence to always have best of everything be in season matter what cost have got quite cellar of wine always take bottle with dinner be sure room be furnished nice enough for anything when came have furniture turned out put in fresh heap of money must have cost can tell fresh paper on wall looking glass picture be nice room indeed must not be nicer except that sitting room be spoilt by big ugly safe have got to keep paper in just spoil room a told seem to mind so there ai reason why must must like to see room roland said not that can afford to furnish mine like at present will show with pleasure sir only if meet get to know afterwards let out that showed room be mighty perticular sort of gent though be so affable pleasant room be quietly handsomely furnished a roland have expected there be nothing whatever in to give clue to identity of owner letter paper be lying about roland attention be particularly drawn towards safe be strong burglar proof structure by one of best maker yes said agree with furniture be very handsome good must not care if be mine to spoil with safe told have lost valuable lot of paper once have determined that must never run risk again so got safe must be carried off broken into next day roland returned to brownsville informed mr fernlea of progress that have made capital roland will certainly employ in detective work may in future come into office two next step to be taken be clear enough be not so easy to see how be to take in first place will have to obtain list of missing security next to find out whether of be still in safe be step how on earth be to take father must hardly be likely to remember number of missing bond must not ask one of director without taking into confidence be averse to doing for hold johnstone in such respect that idea must seem to altogether preposterous at rate must write to father ask roland said may not remember number be hardly possible that must when there be lot of missing might be able to give hint how to set about accordingly roland wrote letter to father informing of step have taken discovery have made see father wrote that while mr fernlea have more doubt than have johnstone stole security accused of taking be very difficult to bring matter home to a first step be absolutely necessary to get number of bond without there being possibility of coming to ear that be moving in matter can suggest plan week later when roland have returned to lodging after dark man be standing at gate roland boy be that good heaven father how startled be glad indeed to see again be surely imprudent to venture back just at moment for be presence here discovered must upset plan come in have key can go up with even if woman of house saw must hardly be likely to recognize for have not be settled in town very long a soon a be in room roland struck light be able to look at father must hardly have recognized so pale haggard be why father have be ill not actually ill roland though almost out of mind at time trust that be nearly over letter have given new life for have made hope that black cloud have fallen over will be cleared away that can again lift up head look fellow men in face be ready now to give up if mr fernlea think that will be best thing for to do to stand trial before have nothing save bare negative to oppose evidence against now there be at least story to tell must not tell at present father must wait till be complete if there be evidence in safe at chicago connecting johnstone with theft may be sure that must be destroyed instant appeared on scene first thing a mr fernlea say be to obtain list of at rate of security be missing hardly hoped that must be able to furnish roland must tell stock to belonged not number so far a know there be one way of doing so besides that of obtaining list from one of director said in letter mr fernlea think must be dangerous to do what be that father be for to go to bank get book johnstone went through together that night how be to do father be probably in safe if be still in existence supposed so roland when went away never thought of leaving key behind found day afterwards in pocket of overcoat unless have changed fastening there be nothing to prevent unlocking door going up to old room entering opening safe a usual there must be occasion even for light for know feel of book so well with locked clasp must tell in dark if put hand on must be awful risk father be detected must be accused hesitated of trying to rob bank for second time mr partridge said well if necessary must run risk at rate father before attempt must speak to mr fernlea have be so good friend throughout business that must not move single step without consulting will go up see at once before start will tell woman of house have friend come to stop with for day two have spare room will get ready for will have supper before start roland go at once will have nap in easy chair while be away for have travelled without stopping once since got letter be not so strong a used to be mr fernlea listened attentively to roland account of interview with father be dangerous step to take said thoughtfully know can propose anything better of course if be taken must come forward declare that be client that have be wrongly accused through that be only going to bank for purpose of possessing of book be private property in order to obtain list of missing security that might if possible trace course must reserve suspicion about johnstone until trial of course there must have to accuse of original theft of security will go back with now talk to poor friend said a entered room where mr partridge too anxious to sleep be walking restlessly to fro see that have told upon sadly however hope that be in fair way of putting matter right at last tell frankly thought at time that be foolish of to run away a did think now that have turned out best for have little defence beyond bare denial whereas must make out strong case of suspicion anyhow against johnstone from what know already do approve of plan for recovery of book yes if can be carried out fear that be likely to have changed lock be first suggestion new cashier on learning that key be missing must make did not think of till be half way here be afraid that be only too likely best plan father roland said will be to give key of door can go round to night try if find open can carry out plan to morrow night if not there be use running risk of being detected might be taken in place roland not at father be not going to enter bank will simply put key in lock turn see if door open will take good care that one be near when do if by possible chance be caught at see though how such thing can happen must simply say that having come across key went for matter of curiosity to see if be one must open bank door yes think there must be much risk in mr fernlea agreed have better go at once roland will remain with father until come back if by chance be detected in trying door must be far better that must be at time of evening when might be passing by accidentally have acted upon impulse to see if key fitted than if be to go down in middle of night in twenty minute roland returned new lock have be put upon door father key wo go in at mr partridge gave exclamation of disappointment trouble about mr fernlea said think that matter very much see list must only be perfect so far a security went through be only small proportion of in hand of bank be essential that must get entire list might happen that have parted with know to have be stolen while may have of others still in possession will think matter over to night see if can hit upon plausible excuse for wanting to get list of missing security without being obliged to hint at purpose for require chapter vi conclusion in morning mr fernlea said to roland when appeared at office more think of more be convinced that must be dangerous to try get of director to act with johnstone virtually run concern others know very little about think must get of to move best man can think of be hertman be one of most prominent men of business be large shareholder in bank be intelligent independent if be convinced that wrong have be done must take up hitherto have of course be under impression that father be guilty expressed freely in condemnation of policy of director in allowing to escape in hushing matter up be not client of mine be concerned in business transaction with think have respect for judgment a have for have written note saying want to speak to on business will be glad if will come over to office will go over to a will be most convenient to will take across at once office be in exchange street mr hertman glanced at note told roland to say that must be across in few minute what be going to say mr hertman will surprise fernlea said when visitor have taken seat be be aware one of largest shareholder in bank be sorry to say that be mr hertman said wish be not ca get rid of share except at very heavy loss that mysterious affair three month ago have greatly depressed value of stock for in fact one seems to know what be amount of loss suffered director told that matter be kept quiet to avoid run upon bank in respect doubt succeeded public confidence seems pretty well restored have idea a to how have come out of well mr hertman may surprise when tell that in matter be acting on behalf of partridge what absconding cashier mr fernlea just so have always entertained strong idea that be innocent be victim of others be happy to say be now far on way to be able to prove say so mr hertman said in surprise why thought there be doubt in matter so most other people thought mr fernlea said dryly certainly running away instead of staying to meet charge be terribly against have not proved so unwise step a thought must have be arrested tried then must have gone hard with a matter have turned out thing have come to light alter complexion of case have heard perhaps that took son into office yes heard that mr hertman replied thought that be piece of mistaken kindness on part that young fellow must have done better to leave place begin life elsewhere took mr hertman in order that might remain upon spot to devote to getting at bottom of mystery may tell at once that be within short distance of success mr fernlea then related whole of incident connected with search there can be little doubt that be right in matter mr hertman said when have concluded that man johnstone be really culprit great wrong have clearly be done can command assistance to utmost in aiding what be wanted fund will draw cheque for amount that may require thank mr hertman from knowledge of character expected nothing le be not object in taking into confidence what want be list of security stolen must doubt mr hertman said whether there be such list in existence one of director who be personal friend of mine told at time of meeting that president explained to what share scrip be missing value that board have individually pledged to keep absolute silence until meeting of shareholder will not take place for six month yet certainly if suspicion be correct think be must be greatly to interest of president that nobody except must have list in case mr fernlea said only way of getting at be to obtain partridge private book there have be fresh cashier appointed have there no chief clerk be acting a cashier at present appointment have not be filled up do posse influence with yes good deal got appointment a clerk there fifteen year ago from recommendation be son of man with whom be closely connected in business matter then perhaps might manage for must propose if will consent be that afternoon when know that johnstone have just left for chicago must see man tell have clue to of missing security that be necessary for to ascertain exact number that think can do so by examination of book kept by partridge on a understand johnstone scored with red ink at least of found to be missing might say that only wanted for two three hour that if must let have must pledge to place in hand again first thing next morning must of course say that for success of endeavour be making be absolutely necessary that one not even president director must have idea that anything be being done in matter think can do mr hertman said smithson will naturally think that if anything come of will get credit for aiding in matter very well then mr fernlea said will let know next time mr johnstone go to chicago generally take trip once week to morrow be usual day next evening book be handed to mr fernlea can be of further use mr hertman asked well if can spare two three hour must be glad if must go through list with partridge be in next room waiting certainly will tell have taken up business in earnest be prepared to help in way possible minute later mr partridge be called in be glad to see mr hertman said regard a deeply wronged man must spend bottom dollar if necessary in clearing up business three men at once sat down to work turned to page where mr johnstone have scored line of red ink against security found to be missing will take down number description of marked one first mr fernlea said because a to there can be mistake be soon done now mr partridge will look at initial closely be yours after long examination mr partridge said be very like mine well let compare with real one mr fernlea said producing magnifying glass see difference mr hertman said do see in own initial take hand off paper at while in there be little break w j be written together writer have paused before making p manner in form letter p be rather peculiar one while w j be easy enough to imitate expect after having finished first letter looked at copy before commencing third see continued upstroke from j to p be a nearly a possible continuous with glass can make out that sometimes line quite touch at others overlap slightly others at once perceived point that have indicated now went through whole book without difficulty marked off share against false initial have be placed took five hour work be just midnight when concluded have got list complete now mr fernlea said very long one be mr hertman said seven hundred thousand dollar why be more than called up capital of bank never told men who examined book on day after affair be first known what real extent of loss be must never have signed that announcement reassuring public however there be reserve to call up if thing be put into good hand bank may pull through yet now what be next step that propose mr fernlea intend to go to new york to obtain assistance of police to call upon broker who have acted for westerton be for johnstone will tell frankly be tracing extensive robbery that have reason to believe that large number of foreign security have passed through hand sent to from chicago will show list ask if have dealt in of if say yes will then have nothing to do to go to chicago obtain warrant for arrest of westerton will not bring johnstone into then next time go over will pounce upon must like to give authority to ask for a one of principal shareholder of bank will go with mr hertman said will have to go there on business in few day anyway can kill two bird with one stone suppose will take mr partridge with certainly will have to tell whole story to commissioner of police will want what say confirmed a to theft number of missing security mission to new york be attended with complete success broker when called upon by mr fernlea mr hertman chief commissioner have hesitation in disclosing dealing with westerton be found that large proportion of security noted have passed through hand have have own suspicion that something be not quite right with gentleman lately two month ago made very lucky hit in corn up to time have be unfortunate a see security have be sold by through to meet loss since then have be buying what struck a singular be that insisted upon getting back very security have parted with have special reason said for wanting particular share others gave lot of trouble because buyer have often parted with sometimes have gone through two three hand have to offer something over market price to get again however with exception of sixty thousand dollar worth have got rather have got be in treaty for most of still want said in letter that be crotchet of put down that be crank thief yet even in latter case must not see reason for wanting to get into hand security have once parted with can only suppose mr fernlea said that be afraid that at meeting of shareholder must insist upon committee being appointed to investigate whole affair list of missing security must then be published in case must of course be traced back to at least to westerton then name be not westerton be not chief commissioner said think will mention just at present what real name be though be likely

crossing meadow in bull be grazing mary mitford be only child of settler who owned cabin have at one time be well to do farmer have fallen into difficulty be obliged to give up farm travel farther west where land must be have for taking up time have be peaceful although spot have fixed upon be ten mile from nearest village did not deter from settling there be natural clearing of twenty acre in extent land be fertile sloped gradually down to lake clear spring rose close to spot where have determined to make house a to indian trouble shrugged shoulder said if indian break out will only have to shut up cabin move into village a there be house nearer than track in forest leading past place nothing worth stealing be hardly likely that red skin will come way be more likely to attack village than be to visit shanty have now lived on little farm for four year have have reason to regret choice cabin originally built have be enlarged have horse to do ploughing ten acre under tillage score of half wild pig roamed by day in forest picking up living there returning of own accord to sty in evening for one regular meal five six cow score of sheep grazed on untilled ground goose duck waddled down to lake at daybreak returned at nightfall two three dozen chicken found plenty of grub worm to eat between row of corn vegetable on tilled ground altogether john mitford be doing well went down once week with duck goose fowl vegetable to village using large boat on have built sort of cabin where often passed night on lake returning home to breakfast with goodly store of wild duck have shot sometimes stag have overtaken a swam across lake so well have done indeed that have settled to take on three four hired men to extend clearing by cutting down grubbing up forest have be ably assisted by wife who not only looked after house assisted on farm at busy time while mary who be nine year old when came there made a useful a must at light work fed animal cooked when mother be in field a grew older spent good deal of time in small birch bark canoe father have bought for in village added good deal to family store by fishing not only be house well supplied enabled father to take large basketful down when went to village where people be too busy to fish for also learned to use father rifle with skill equal to own must hit duck came within range of weapon from time to time there be rumour of trouble with indian either proved to be without foundation trouble took place at distant spot on border sometimes mary mother accompanied father to village when store have to be laid in material for garment purchased for own homespun cloth be unsuitable have started together morning three men who have be engaged be to return with be to be accommodated in outhouse until have built log cabin for store of grocery saw ax blanket other necessary for use be also to be purchased brought up have when settler have gone down on previous week heard council have be held among village elder a to rumoured indian trouble a to best method of defending place must enemy threaten attack john mitford have received many warning paid little attention to while speaking lightly of to wife remarked with laugh with hired men must have quite garrison will bring gun up with said will scarcely be worth while of indian to attack when know that must be able to make stout fight that even if took place there must be nothing to pay except scalp for loss of life must suffer men hired to day be accustomed to border work claim to be good shot can say a much for mary here be good bit better than be have learned to make very fair practice wife have not have time for much of john at least think must scarcely miss indian at fifty yard however a say have be hearing rumour three four month since settled here nothing have ever come of so little did think of matter when started in scow hour before daybreak allusion be made to mary be to have supper ready for on return remember that there will be six mary will have to provide plentifully for men must never do to give bad impression on arrival will be back before nightfall when have gone mary went about usual work let pig out saw well on way towards forest duck started down to lake chicken to field while goose began to graze in meadow between house lake where horse other animal joined a soon a be let out having attended to matter went about work of house from time to time came to door to see that be going on well be three o'clock in afternoon when heard sudden squeal of alarm in forest minute two later pig came galloping out of accustomed a mary be to noise of place sudden outcry startled what can have frightened pig said to herself may be that mountain lion have sprang down upon one of may be that there be indian went back at once into house pulled out moss from loophole have be made when be built in case must ever be attacked going from one to gazed into forest before doing so have looked to priming of three rifle two shot gun hung on wall must see nothing observed that there be general feeling of uneasiness among animal horse have stopped feeding with ear outstretched seemed to be listening for sound in forest cow after staring about commenced to walk in direction of byre goose be near edge of lake gave warning cry keeping close together also moved towards house girl have heard so many story of indian raid on lonely settlement that felt sure that attack must not be made until after dark must hardly know that be alone in house must not risk losing life by advance against in broad daylight a moved from loophole to loophole thought over what be best to be done although indian might wait till if saw advantage in attacking before must assuredly fall upon father party a landed a with advantage of such surprise might expect to slaughter without resistance be hardly likely that large party must be in wood have heard father often say that body of indian on war path must make straight for settlement must not waste time upon isolated farm though straggler from main body might do so must do something at once said to herself at last if indian see one about may crawl up here though might shoot one two of must not be on side of house at once if be killed father must be sure to fall into trap from way goose behaved believe must be party who be travelling down lake knowing of clearing landed little distance away moved along shore a canoe often traverse lake indian have eye for detail must know that occupant posse scow that a be not there of inhabitant be certainly away must therefore probably wait until return before making attack on hut must be easily captured while be to attack cabin at once firing might be heard on scow being thus warned might go at once to village where report must give alarm to inhabitant so put on guard against attack be to be made upon by main body night thing be thought over by girl have so often listened to story of indian raid told by passing hunter who put up for night that be able to judge situation a accurately a older settler might have done be pale be only sign of consciousness that life be in extreme danger knew that if attack have not be made at once indian must have good reason for waiting from time to time indian canoe have stopped there occupant have landed in order to exchange skin other article for tobacco powder so save journey down to settlement must know that mother father be sole occupant absence of scow showed that father be away that place must be easily captured though perhaps not without loss of blood for woman of frontier be usually able to use rifle on emergency went out occasionally took food for pig hung up clothes to dry in quiet unconcerned manner in order to show that suspicion be entertained that indian be in neighbourhood at last determined upon best course to be pursued be above thing necessary to warn parent that attempt might cost life did not weigh in slightest must certainly be killed if remained there there be just possibility that might succeed in saving life a well a own by action once in canoe might escape be very small light constant exercise have so strengthened arm that must make fly through water at speed at few of indian with whom have sometimes tried spin must surpass canoe canoe however in red skin have arrived be doubtless paddled by three more men must certainly overtake be knowledge that be so that have prevented from making earlier start to give chance of getting away must carry rifle with once lurking enemy who be doubtless watching movement perceived that be armed must guess at once that be conscious of presence must rush out tomahawk before reached water edge at last decided upon plan taking off gown fastened rifle with cord round body butt be against shoulder barrel came down just below ankle projecting inch two below gown when put on again even sharpest indian eye must scarcely notice a walked through grass have passed rope once round body have tied end in bow so that must in moment unloose on reaching canoe for must be impossible for to kneel down with rifle in present position took powder horn slung over shoulder by cord put dozen bullet into pocket then put grain into basket be ready to start before leaving house stood for few minute in silent prayer for be unable to kneel then went out needed great effort to saunter leisurely along thought of parent danger nerved went from animal to animal giving handful two of grain calling to singing in voice in at first there be little quaver soon rang out loud fearlessly fortunately horse one two of cow be feeding close down by lake a went hope rose after feeding strolled in leisurely way towards canoe standing close to looked over water then went down to edge gazed down lake a if looking for returning scow after standing thus for minute two returned to canoe pulled at end of rope under loose dress let muzzle of rifle drop to ground stooped over canoe a if arranging paddle placed rifle in action thought must hardly have be seen by indian for tree be two hundred yard on side of then lifted light canoe carried down to water be critical moment indian might allow to go unmolested thinking that be only going for short paddle to pas away time until parent returned in case must crawl across enter cabin in order to take party by surprise a unsuspectingly strolled up from scow on other hand if thought that have have idea of presence be going to warn father must know coveted scalp must be lost if did not succeed in catching a seated in canoe took up paddle heart beat high with hope glancing towards tree saw six red skin running at full speed from edge of forest what have reckoned upon have occurred sharp eye have caught flash of sun upon barrel of rifle a put in at once guessed that be aware of presence be endeavouring to escape be well that have lost not moment time after placing canoe in water nervousness have now passed away with rapid steady stroke drove light craft ahead be fifty sixty yard out on to lake before indian reached spot have left have be silent hitherto yell rose fiercely a fired shot after shot powder sold to indian be always of poor quality though ball fell close to none struck red skin did not wait to reload ran back to forest minute after have disappeared among tree saw canoe with three paddler dash out from bush in have be concealed have three hundred yard start although be rowing hardest looking over shoulder from time to time found that be gaining upon when mile have be passed be seventy eighty yard ahead with sweep of paddle turned canoe broadside to pursuer laid paddle in seized rifle took steady aim fired report be followed by yell indian in bow dropped paddle fell back at other time at so short distance must not have missed aim at centre of chest by finger breadth though have held breath in order to steady rifle arm be quivering from exertion have only hit on right shoulder red mark on brown skin showing where be struck moment later be again on way fall of man against red skin behind have nearly upset indian canoe have gained several length before pursuit be continued looked round saw that wounded man be again kneeling in place paddle have fallen overboard when be struck even have not be so must have rendered slight assistance to comrade with one hand available be lucky that be not killed said to herself if have be must have thrown overboard minute later heard splash wounded man have leapt into water be making for shore be fair race now thought canoe be large one a held three sitter besides rower now must take steadily be sure will not gain on a long a can keep up be just question of last rowed however hardest for few minute a be important to get beyond range of indian gun when glance round showed that be hundred twenty yard ahead of pursuer settled down into long steady stroke knew well that be now practically safe for even if one of gun must carry to be difficult even for best shot to aim from dancing canoe for hour there be change in position indian be rowing hardest weight of comparatively heavy canoe be telling upon a much a labour of driving light craft be upon girl be well for out of door life daily practice have hardened muscle strengthened frame have once paused for couple of second pulled off frock at once cumbered movement be terribly hot speed of canoe have scarcely slackened when paddle be at work again felt sensible relief from freedom of limb few minute later little cry of joy broke from a saw scow come out from behind point two mile away sight gave renewed hope strength must have left village earlier than have expected on other hand yell from red skin told that too have seen scow must certainly exert to utmost to overtake before reached although have seemed that paddler be doing best before added speed of canoe told that exertion have be redoubled when within mile of scow girl glanced backwards indian have gained thirty yard upon five minute must bring within rifle shot of scow must see by motion of oar that rower be doing utmost while others be standing up watching chase with rifle in hand strength be failing fast now struggled on determinedly at least have saved father mother two minute later started at report of gun behind splash of ball in water alongside canoe felt that be safe now red skin must not have stopped to fire have not felt that be last chance of revenge few more stroke looked round indian be already on way towards shore then let paddle drop collapsed in bottom of canoe hearing faintly sound of repeated shot from scow be now little more than quarter of mile away hitherto have be unable to fire a two canoe be in line faintly heard shout in father voice be hit mary be incapable of making effort to reply be not until scow came alongside be lifted on board that be able to answer relief of father mother be intense when found that be unwounded have heard indian fire at distance be away have seemed to that canoe be close to other then saw red skin at once make for shore have so quickly afterwards sunk into canoe that greatly feared be wounded men with however be unanimous in agreeing that have not be hit if have be argued pursuer must certainly have paddled up to canoe taken scalp before making for shore be time before be able to tell story frontiersman be a warm in expression of admiration for coolness a be parent consultation be now held a to best plan to be pursued be finally agreed that one of men must take canoe return to village be four mile away warn to prepare for attack night stockade have already be strengthened if prepared be probable that settler must be able to beat off attack scow be then put in motion again be felt that three indian on shore must have done nothing until learned from men in canoe that pursuit have failed that settler have be warned must probably have followed along shore to see result might either return burn cabin slaughter cattle might go on join indian who be doubtless gathered close to village frontiersman be of opinion that must take latter course red skin be fond of revenge one of men said be fonder of scalp will not expect to get much plunder from house will certainly get scalp though might do lot of mischief on clearing must offer le satisfaction to than getting share of plunder scalp from village besides put in must certainly get into bad odour with tribe if be absent from attack take for certain that have order to go straight there that be only hope that must bring in scalp induced to land at clearing think that be plumb sure that will go straight on rowing vigorously reached farm hour before sunset to great satisfaction saw animal grazing a usual cabin intact sign of enemy presence nevertheless frontiersman advised mr mitford to proceed cautiously for be just possible indian be hidden in house accordingly told wife daughter to remain in scow when men landed be pushed off into deep water grapnel dropped men moved up through tree until abreast of house be convinced that be not there settler said animal be feeding quietly goose be just in front of door be sure that if red skin be inside horse cattle must all be gathered by water goose be a watchful a dog must not be near house others agreed stooping low made way through standing grain until within thirty yard of house then with rifle advanced ready to fire dashed forward still be quiet be not here one of men said positively certainly must have fired not let get up against wall have only to walk in went round to door entered be exactly a mary have left fire have burnt low pot be still simmering over farmer went down to water fetched up wife mary if have be for mary said everything must have be destroyed here must be lying dead on shore question be next discussed what have best do frontiersman be unanimous in opinion that there be fear of attack night be equally certain that one must be made next night at latest on following matter whether take village not be sure to attack if have won varmint have baulked to day will bring party of friend here for plunder scalp if be beaten off will before return home ravage outlying farm to make matter sure must say must be safest for wife daughter to sleep on board scow can bring in close to shore camp down there ourselves so that if need be can get on board put out into lake have only one canoe a far a know if have dozen must not dare to attack think that there be chance of trouble to night in morning must say best plan must be to get thing most value on board scow with enough meat provision to last for week must stay with lady on board will drive animal couple of mile into forest worst can happen then be that when indian come will burn down house see that can prevent that if be to lay off here in scow must keep from approaching within range of rifle must not prevent from coming down from behind house doe not matter about cabin settler said be easily put up again indeed have intended before long to pull down rebuild in better style put close down by water must be good plan bos if be to put there make strong palisade running from on side down to water must fight out against big lot of red skin if worst came to worst must make off in scow must put bag two of grain in boat if be now when start in morning row along shore to east till see come out will bunch animal close by there if give feed evening be safe not to wander very far be not likely red skin will trouble to hunt for will burn house then make off might leave dozen of sheep here if come indian can make meal wo be wanting to search wood for one be safe to make off without delay when have once got beating care to hang about if have succeeded at village got scalp booty of will at once start for home to have dance after victory others will be off to strike blow at other village before news of what have occurred reach settler so matter be carried out night passed quietly in morning frontiersman putting ear down to surface of lake must make out heavy firing in distance knew that attack on village have begun work be then set about whole of feathered stock be tied by leg placed in scow store of provision grocery linen clothes be placed on board then settler with wife daughter pushed off while three men drove animal into forest three hour later on scow saw appear at edge of lake nearly three mile from clearing scow be at once rowed ashore animal have be driven to small clearing quarter of mile away on party going up be found to be still there mary went round petting giving handful of grain after remaining there for hour returned to lake scow be hidden under branch overhanging water in afternoon small canoe with solitary paddler be seen coming along keeping close inshore a approached mary recognized canoe men declared that rower be comrade who have gone to give alarm to village what news reuben shouted a soon a be within hearing bad news said village be taken soul murdered made good fight red skin be too strong got hit in leg pretty early in fight finding be more use got two woman to carry down to canoe knew must be a comfortable there a anywhere if thing went wrong gave chance two hour later heard by screaming that red skin have forced palisade be in village so thought that be time for to be off be able to sit up though be badly hit below knee paddled off made for clearing when got there saw at once that animal be gone made sure that have be driven into forest that have taken to scow did not suppose that have gone very far so came on looking for glad enough be to hear shout fear that in village have be murdered mr mitford said have not doubt of red fiend spare one especially a there be stout resistance good many of have be wiped out be now helped out of canoe comrade of whom have much experience of wound examined leg carefully be of opinion that although bone be splintered be not broken that ball have gone out behind best thing to do one of said will be to make deep cut pick out piece of bone will never heal properly with in fire away then wounded man said coolly be best to make good job of at once now know that bone be not really broken mind what do with do happen to have new knife mr mitford one of other frontiersman said turning to settler one want new knife sharp one can not give new one be only yesterday that ground own knife be sharp clean will do first rate taking long knife settler wore in sheath hanging from belt proceeded to operate not groan sigh proceeded from wounded man accustomed to hard life a men be be almost a insensible to pain a indian after splinter of bone have be removed wound be washed with warm water then carefully bandaged fire have by time be short distance in forest in position where light must not be observed by passing canoe here men bivouacked taking by turn to keep watch for four day remained here then one of started a soon a be dark in mary canoe to examine clearing returned in little over hour cabin outbuilding have be burnt place be absolutely deserted be agreed that there be not slightest chance of indian returning there settler three of men at once began to fell tree while fourth who must not assist in active work for time went down in canoe to village found have be entirely destroyed that body of state militia have arrived there from learned that village have be destroyed in attack on third indian have be repulsed with great loss have not since be heard of be believed that have retired to own village three month later log house have be erected by water side with palisade running down into deep water be large comfortable being built of square log well loopholed with door window on water side only must resist formidable attack very strong gate in one of palisade must admit of animal being driven in there for shelter have be taken into forest have be recovered house done men set to work to enlarge clearing ten year later be one of largest best cultivated farm on lake mary whose exploit have gained for wide reputation throughout district for courage coolness have long before married young englishman who have come out with capital with intention of farming mary must not hear of leaving father mother accordingly entered into partnership with mr mitford energy capital have small share in developing farm second log house be built within twenty yard of other connected with by strong palisade however settler be never again disturbed by indian so many new comer have settled beyond that must no longer be called outlying
