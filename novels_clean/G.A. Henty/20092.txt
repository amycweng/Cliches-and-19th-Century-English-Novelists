however that gaspard highly approved of husband determination fie upon lucie forget that marie be of noble blood in respect being of condition somewhat above although too be connected with many good family in poitou in other time must have said be better that boy must grow up to till land be assuredly honourable profession rather than to become military adventurer fighting only for vainglory in day sword be not drawn for glory for right to worship god in peace one can doubt that ere long men of reformed religion will take up arm to defend right to live worship god in own way cruel persecution under francis first henry second francis second have utterly failed in object when merindol cabrieres twenty two other town village be destroyed in person persecuted forced to recant to fly a did be thought that be handful whom must be easy to exterminate in spite of edict after edict of persecution slaughterings burning in spite of massacre of amboise others reformed religion have

court be evident that prelate be unable to answer argument of champion guise hear be furious for present catharine queen mother be anxious for peace toleration be probable that end of argument at poissy will be edict allowing freedom of worship will only infuriate still more papist urged on by rome philip of spain then there will be appeal to arm contest will be dreadful one navarre from hear have be well nigh won over by guise noble wife will say hold faith to end kingdom will follow conde be a good general a guise with there be host of noble rochefoucauld chatillons soubise gramont rohan

weaver said gloomily though not without intermission for believe that after success on one side other there will be truce concession to be followed by fresh persecution fresh war until reformed faith becomes religion of france be entirely stamped out what be true of france be true of holland philip will annihilate reformer there will shake off yoke of spain england will be driven to join in one struggle for if papacy be triumphant in france holland spain france must unite against so see sister that in opinion be at commencement of long bloody struggle for freedom of worship at rate will be good that boy must be trained a must have be have married one of own rank in france in order that when come to man estate may be able to wield sword worthily in defence of faith have son must train a husband intends to train phil may be that will never be called upon to draw sword time have spent in acquiring use will not be wasted exercise give firmness suppleness to figure quickness to eye

strength god have given can never feel be instructed in arm when boy be none worse weaver for forget lucie that boy have blood of many good french family in vein must rejoice that husband be willing that will be so trained that if need must ever come will do discredit to ancestor on side english have many virtue freely recognize can not deny that many of be somewhat rough uncouth being wondrous lacking in manner coarse in speech be sure that must not wish son to grow up like many of young fellow who come into town on market day son will make worse farmer for being trained a gentleman have training of french lady yet manage farm to admiration lucie trust between will make true christian true gentleman of that if need be will show good soldier also so between french relative sturdy english father philip fletcher have unusual training among huguenot learned to be gentle courteous to bear among elder respectfully without fear shyness to consider while thing be of minor consequence in comparison to right to worship god in freedom purity yet that man must be fearless of death ready to defend right with moderation without pushing to injury of others that must be grave decorous of speech yet of gay cheerful spirit strove hard so to deport that if at time must return to mother country must take place among relation without discredit learned to fence to dance of stricter of huguenot be of opinion that latter accomplishment be unnecessary if not absolutely sinful gaspard vaillant be firm on point dancing be stately graceful exercise said like use of arm greatly improves carriage poise of figure queen elizabeth love dancing none can say that be not good protestant youth must be taught to dance if only may know how to walk be not one of who think that because man be

fun merriment however seldom found vent in laughter intercourse with grave huguenot saddened by exile quiet restrained in manner taught to repress mirth must have appeared to unseemly to remain grave

length agreed to send six thousand men to hold town of havre dieppe rouen providing three town be handed over to thus evincing same calculating greed marked subsequent dealing with dutch in struggle for freedom in vain conde coligny begged not to impose condition that frenchman must hold to be infamous to in vain throgmorton ambassador at paris warned that must alienate protestant of france from while possession of city must avail little in vain minister cecil urged frankly to ally with protestant from first outbreak of war for freedom of conscience in france to termination of struggle in holland elizabeth baffled friend enemy by vacillation duplicity utter want of faith doling out aid in spirit of huckster rather than queen so that be in end even more hated by protestant of holland france than by catholic of france spain to who look only at progress made by england during reign of elizabeth thanks to great minister valiant sailor soldier long year of peace at home spirit energy of people elizabeth may appear great monarch to who study character from relation with struggling protestant of holland france will appear that be although intellectually great morally one of meanest

already taller than be rene gustave tell that have taught know with sword dagger have be stout men at arm in time assure that lad must hold own against young french noble of own age against not few men be time that came to conclusion about future illustration gaspard vaillant make proposal have thought of much gaspard lying here so helpless thought do naturally turn to boy have grown almost beyond power of understanding sometimes when hear laughing jesting with men with of school friend whom brings up here seems to that see again in that be merry young fellow full of life fun able to hold own at singlestick to foot round maypole with lad in kent of age then again when be talking with mother giving direction in name to french labourer see different lad altogether grave quiet with gentle courteous way fit for young noble ten year senior know between gaspard have made mess of that might have be better for to have grown up altogether a be with thought care save management of farm with liking for sport fun when such came in way not at not at gaspard vaillant broke in hastily have made fine man of john seems to that posse best quality of race be frank hearty full of life spirit when a say occasion offer giving whole heart to work play with plenty of determination what english call backbone there be in fact solid english foundation to character then from side have gained gravity of demeanour belongs to huguenot with courtesy of manner carriage bearing of young frenchman of good blood above john be sober christian strong in reformed faith with burning hatred against persecutor be french spanish well then being what be what be to be done with in first place be bent upon remaining here think that with quality disposition must be well that for while have wider scope lucie have managed farm for last fifteen year can well continue to do so for ten if god must spare own opinion be that for time might be left to try strength to devote to good cause talent god have given skill training that have acquired through that must be for good to make acquaintance of french kinsfolk to see something of world know be wish also gaspard have frequently turned matter over in mind have concluded must be wish also must be well for to throw objection in way will miss boy sorely young bird can not be kept always in nest think that lad have such good stuff in that be pity to keep shut up here now john brother in law went on although may never have said quite a much before have said enough for to know what intention be god have not be pleased to bestow child upon philip be nearest relation stand to almost in light of son god have blest work for last twenty year though have done hope fully share towards assisting countryman in distress putting by always one third of income for purpose be rich man factory have grown larger larger not because desired greater gain might give employment to more more of countryman since death of lequoc twelve year ago have be entirely in hand living quietly a have done greater portion of profit have be laid by year therefore putting out of account money that good sister have laid by philip will start in life not ill equipped know that lad have said nothing of wish may entertain at age must not be becoming for to do so until elder speak of late when have read to letter from friend in france when have listened to tale of freshly arrived from ruined home have noted that colour rose that finger tightened a if on sword must see how passionately be longing to join who be struggling against cruel oppressor not le interested have be in noble struggle that dutch be making against spaniard struggle in many of exiled countryman be sharing one of mother cousin count de la noue be a know prominent among huguenot leader others of relative be ranged on same side at present there be truce party feel that be hollow one nevertheless offer good opportunity for to visit mother family whether there be prospect of ever recovering land be confiscated on flight be uncertain must huguenot ever maintain ground win freedom of worship in france may be that confiscated estate will in many case be restored a to however be perfectly indifferent be younger man must close factory return to france bear share in defence of faith a be must like to send philip over a substitute must at rate be well that must make acquaintance of kinsfolk in france although even must not wish that must cease to regard england a native country home hundred of young men many older than be in holland fighting against persecutor risking life though having kinship with dutch impelled simply by love of faith hatred of persecution have lately john though matter have be kept quiet purchased farm of blunt mardyke neighbour on hand be nearly twice size of own have arranged with men for present will continue to work a tenant a be before tenant of sir james holford who having wasted money at court have be forced to sell portion of estate thus day phil will come into possession of land will place in good position be prepared to add to considerably sir james holford still gamble away possession have explained to notary willingness to extend purchase at time must desire to sell must at once commence building of comfortable mansion be scarce worth while to do so for be probable that before many year sir james may be driven to part with hall a well a land in meantime be ready to provide philip with income will enable to take place with credit among kinsfolk to raise company of fifty men to follow in field must conde huguenot again be driven to struggle against guise what do think think in first place lucie must be indeed grateful to gaspard for generous offer a to going to france must talk over with mother whose wish in a in respect be paramount with may say at once that lying here a do thinking of horrible cruelty oppression to men woman be subjected for faith sake in france holland feel that who be happily able to worship in peace quiet ought to hesitate at sacrifice on behalf moreover seeing that owing to affliction owes what be rather to mother than to think wish that must make acquaintance of kinsfolk in france be natural one have wish for lad to become courtier english french that must a englishman have done before now in foreign army gain great honour reputation if be wish to fight on behalf of persecuted people of god whether in france in holland will do so with heartiest goodwill if die must not die in more glorious cause let talk of other matter now gaspard be one need thought before more word be spoken two day later john fletcher have long talk with phil latter be delighted when heard project be greatly in accord with side of character a english lad looked forward eagerly to adventure peril a french of reformed religion be rejoiced at thought of fighting with huguenot against persecutor of serving under men with whose name reputation be so familiar know uncle plan for a yet phil father said went not into such matter leaving to be talked over after have be settled whether offer must be accepted not purpose well by regard a heir have already bought blunt mardyke farm purpose to buy other part of estate of sir james holford a may slip through knight finger at gambling table therefore in time will become person of standing in county although care little for thing now phil yet must like to be somewhat more than mere squire if serve for while under such great captain a coligny conde will give reputation weight good uncle friend think little of such matter own be not uninfluenced by coligny for example be man whom honour that honour be not altogether because be leader of reformed faith because be great soldier think that honour reputation be to be despised doubtless first thing of be that man must be good christian will in way prevent from being great man nay will add to greatness have noble kinsfolk in france to of whom uncle will doubtless commit may be that will have opportunity of distinguishing must such occur be sure will avail of a one must do who come of good stock on side for although fletcher have be yeoman from generation to generation have be ever ready to take give share of hard blow when be going there have be few battle fought since william norman came over that fletcher have not fought in english rank whether in france in scotland in own trouble therefore seems to natural that for many reason must desire at age to take part in fighting a englishman because englishman fought six year ago under banner of conde a protestant on behalf of persecuted brother a frenchman by mother side because have kinsfolk engaged because be pope philip of spain a well a guise who be in fact battling to stamp out french liberty of one thing be sure boy will disgrace honest english name french blood in vein profession a christian protestant there be englishman gaining credit on spanish main under drake hawkins there be englishman fighting manfully by side of dutch there be others in army of protestant prince of germany in none of matter be so deeply concerned a be in affair of france religion will miss of course philip that sorely have long seen that must probably be upshot of training since can myself take share in adventure beyond wall of house will feel that be living again in lad never forget that be english be philip fletcher come of old kentish stock though may be living with french kinsfolk friend always keep uppermost fact that be englishman who sympathizes with france not frenchman with english blood in vein have given up greatly to french relation here if win credit honour must have won by son philip fletcher born in england of english father who will one day be gentleman landowner in county of kent sha' forget that father philip said earnestly have never regarded a in way french although speaking tongue a well a english being so much among mother friend living here with where people have lived so many year hearing from tale from history seeing english field around being at english school among english boy have ever felt that be english though in way regretting huguenot blood inherit from mother believe that if fight in france will be a englishman who have drawn sword in quarrel rather a one who hate oppression cruelty than because have french kinsman engaged in be well philip may be away for year trust that on return will find sitting here to welcome back creaking wheel last long have everything to make life happy peaceful best of wife well ordered farm thought care a to worldly affair since have be god will that such must be life interest will be wholly centred in hope to see child playing round for ought know grandchild for be long lived race now philip have best go down see uncle thank for good intention towards tell that wholly agree with plan that if aunt will come up evening will enter farther into that evening john fletcher learned that be intention of gaspard that wife must accompany philip marie yearns to see people again said present be good time for to do so for when war once break out again none can say how long will last how will terminate sister lucie countess de laville have a know frequently written urgently for marie to go over pay visit hitherto have never be able to bring to spare feel that be so good opportunity must let go for few week philip must not be introduced under better auspex will escort marie to aunt remain there with then see on board ship again at la rochelle after doubtless will remain at aunt when struggle begin will ride with cousin francois have hesitated whether must go also in first place business must get on badly without in second although marie might travel safely enough might be

religious trouble began be great number of year since have be called upon to take field for last eight year however have be trained drilled fifty at time coming up once week began two year before last war a father always held that be absurd to take number of men wholly unaccustomed to use of arm into field agincourt taught that lesson to noble though have be forgotten by most of have two officer accustomed to drill marshal men act a teacher here in hall footman practise with pike sword be exercised with arquebus crossbow in park mounted men be taught to manoeuvre charge so that in case of need can show good face against body of troop of equal number be here practise with maitre d'armes with montpace bourdon two officer ah here be charles maitre d'armes charles be cousin philip who will also be pupil of yours while remains here what do say philip will try bout with blunted sword just now with pleasure philip said art of fencing have not at time reached perfection afterwards attained sword used be long straight sharpened at edge be used a much for cutting a thrusting in single combat on foot long dagger be generally held in left hand be used for purpose of guarding of striking at close quarter put on thick quilted doublet light helmet with visor do use dagger philip have never seen one used in england be taught to guard with sword a well a to strike with monsieur have learned from english teacher maitre d'armes asked have have english teacher a well a french philip said learn use of sword in england uncle monsieur vaillant have taken great pain in having taught also by such french professor of arm a lived in canterbury happened to pas through own prefer english style of fighting generally stand upright to work equally poised on two foot for advance retreat while lean with body far forward arm outstretched seems to to cripple movement yes put body out of harm way francois said be arm business to guard body francois be impossible to strike downright blow when leaning so far forward strike little nowadays in single combat maitre d'armes said point be more effective be doubtless so maitre charles philip agreed have not learned fencing for sake of fighting duel to be able to take part on field of battle spaniard be said to be master of straight sword yet have be roughly used in western sea by sailor who methinks always use edge two now took up position facing other attitude be strikingly different francois stood on bent knee leaning far forward while philip stood erect with knee slightly bent ready to spring forward backwards with arm half extended for time fought cautiously francois have be well taught having have benefit whenever be in paris of best master there be extremely active a warmed to work philip have difficulty in standing ground against impetuous rush minute passed without of succeeding in touching other at maitre d'armes called upon to lower sword be enough said be equally matched congratulate monsieur philip have be well taught indeed there be not many youth of age who must hold own with pupil take off helmet enough have be done for one day peste philip francois said a removed helmet be not wrong when said that from figure be sure that have learned fencing maitre charles interfered on behalf to save mortification of defeat have nearly shot bolt have scarcely begun own convert attitude be better than ours be when hand be skilful enough to defend body fatigue of holding arm extended a do be much greater than be a stand in long run must get better of anyone who be not sufficiently skilful to slay before arm becomes fatigued what do think maitre charles cousin be two year younger than be yet wrist arm be stronger than mine a must feel time put aside attack be that so maitre d'armes said in surprise have taken for senior will be famous man at arm when attains full age defence be wonderfully strong although admit that be superior to with point must be formidable opponent to of best swordsman in melee if a say be more accustomed to use edge than point will myself try tomorrow if will permit have always understood that english be more used to strike than to thrust although in duel edge have little chance against point own that be altogether different in melee on horseback especially a point can not penetrate armour while stout blow well delivered with strong arm can break in be skilled in exercise of ring monsieur philip not at have have practise whatever in except in of great house tourney have gone quite out of fashion in england though can ride horse across country know nothing whatever of knightly exercise father be small proprietor up to time left england have be schoolboy if schoolboy understand use of arm a do maitre charles said courteously be wonder that english be terrible fighter say that philip said smiling have have advantage of best teaching english french to be have at canterbury must be shame for indeed if have not learnt to defend servant now entered said that countess desired presence at once went to apartment where sister be talking what do think mother francois said cousin of mine whom have intended to patronize turn out to be already better swordsman than be not better madame philip said hastily be fair match having touched other philip be too modest mother francois laughed maitre charles stopped in time to save from defeat why have wrist like iron cousin of mine have done best to have well taught madame vaillant said there be good swordsman among huguenot friend have also have best english teacher must get for husband always wished particularly that if ever came over to visit friend here must not be deficient in such matter feel little crestfallen countess said have be rather proud of francois ' skill a swordsman own that be little mortifying to find that philip who be two year younger be already match still be glad that be so for if ride together into battle must wish that philip must do honour to race now philip have be hearing about mother life a well a of uncle aunt now let hear about own must need differ widely from to francois have be accustomed aunt say that english school differ altogether from ours with son be generally brought up at home be instructed by chaplain in huguenot family by priest in catholic family else go to religious seminary where be taught what be necessary of book latin being under strict supervision learning other matter such a use of arm after leaving school when at home with family philip gave account of school life rough game sport be possible philip countess said in tone of horror that used to wrestle to fight fight with arm fist against rough boy son of sort of common people certainly did aunt did great deal of good harm so far a know rough sport strengthen frame give quickness vigour just same a exercise with sword do must never have be so tall strong a be now if instead of going to english school have be either a say educated at home by chaplain sent to be taught looked after by priest mother did not like at first came to see that be good for besides there be not same difference between class in england a there be in france there be more independence in lower middle class le haughtiness pride in upper think that be better so be english custom emilie sister said can assure that husband have got very english in thing love country see that in many respect english way be better than ours admire independence of people man respecting though giving honour not lavishly to higher placed countess shrugged shoulder will not argue marie at rate whatever process have succeeded well with philip day passed quietly at chateau before breakfast philip spent hour on horseback learning to manage horse by pressure of knee hand be more easy a horse have be thoroughly trained in menage under instruction of captain montpace who have be francois ' teacher made rapid progress be much easier to teach man than horse instructor said although horse learns readily enough when rider be master of art with horse rider alike ignorant be long business to get to work together a if be one be what must be a horse know work obey motion however slight will soon be able to pas muster on back must take month of patient teaching for so to acquire art of horsemanship a to be able to train animal after lesson be over francois philip must tilt at ring go through other exercise

one other pistol however be becoming recognized portion of outfit of cavalier in field following francois ' advice philip practised with one steadily until became fair shot be cowardly weapon francois said for that be useful in battle when be surrounded by three four pikemen thrusting at be good thing to be able to disembarrass of one two of besides german horseman of whom guise employ so many carry firearm contest must be too uneven if be armed only with sword though for part wish that government of europe must agree to do away with firearm of description place meanest footman upon level

have man of age than older one be different with be francois count de laville servant whatever age must hold in respect be younger of far le consequence old servant might want to take under tuition moreover if there be hard work to be done for must rather have young fellow like doing than older man be always making out that be boy philip look be going to play man part mean to play a far a can francois doe not really make day older well mind not word to soul a to day fixed on for next fortnight scene at chateau be busy one huguenot gentleman came went fifty men at arm who be to accompany francois be inspected arm armour served out to tenantry came up in small party be also provided with weapon offensive defensive from armoury so that might be in readiness to assemble for defence of chateau at shortest notice be kept in ignorance a to what be really going on be felt that crisis be approaching there be expression of grim satisfaction on stern face of men showed rejoiced at prospect of termination to long passive suffering have borne at hand of persecutor of faith hitherto have suffered little for huguenot be strong in south of poitou while in niort nearest town to chateau huguenot if not in absolute majority be far too strong to be molested by opposite party nevertheless here in other town public worship be suspended be only in chateau castle of noble that huguenot must gather to worship without fear of interruption outrage there be considerable debate a to whether francois ' troop must march to join admiral at chatillon sur loing must proceed to southeast where party be nearly equally balanced former course be decided upon march must be more perilous a conde admiral brother d'andelot must be with force gathered there be most important point moreover francois de la noue must be there so well be secret of intended movement kept that french court be at meaux have idea of danger threatened when report of intention of huguenot came from

captain troop may be that armour will be useful on day of battle philip said at present seems to francois must much rather be without quite agree with philip if have only to fight with gentleman armed with sword must gladly go into battle unprotected against men with lance one need defence however care so much now that have got rid of helmet in truth be heavy burden methinks francois that armour will ere long be abandoned now that arquebus cannon be coming more more into use against give protection be better methinks to have lightness freedom of action than to have trouble of wearing iron stuff merely a protection against lance have be trained to wear armour therefore feel le inconvenience have never have a much a breast plate on before feel at present a if have almost lost use of arm think that at rate will speedily get rid of arm piece body armour so much mind now that be fairly in saddle leg piece be not a bad a on arm be scarcely able to walk in still now that be mounted feel

francois said hope that will have opportunity of doing good work before reach paris especially that will not arrive there too late to join in coming battle think that there be much fear of that count replied prince have not sufficient strength to attack paris for part think that must have be far better when be found that plan of seizing court have failed to have drawn off at once can hing against paris presence before will only incite inhabitant against increase animosity must have be better to have applied force in reducing several strong town where a at orleans bulk of inhabitant be favourable to in way must weaken enemy strengthen provide place of refuge for people in case of need however be too late for such regret prince be there must take what succour can be pleased with in fight upon day entered behaved like brave gentleman good swordsman expected le from francois be surprised to find english cousin so skilled with weapon be better swordsman than be francois said be shame to since be two year junior be indeed count said in surprise have taken to be at least equal in year let think be eighteen month month over eighteen francois said philip have just passed sixteen will make doughty warrior when attain full strength philip saw put aside thrust from officer in melee strike from horse with backhanded cut with sword dealt with vigour left nothing to be desired know that be too fond of using edge sir philip said modestly english master taught to do so although french instructor at home be always impressing upon that point be more deadly than edge can not break altogether from habit there be need to do so count said of late point have come into fashion among doubtless have advantage often downright blow will fetch man from saddle when must in vain try to find with point joint in armour must have be well taught indeed if be better swordsman than cousin whose power have tried at laville found to be excellent swordsman for age have have many master philip said french english teacher be good swordsman be seldom frenchman who have be in war passed through canterbury that uncle did not engage to give few lesson thus being very anxious to become good swordsman being fond of exercise naturally picked up great many trick with sword must not have spent time better if have intention of coming over to take part in trouble here grandfather de moulins be said to be one of best swordsman in france may have inherited of skill own felt rather uneasy at charge of two such young cockerel though must not refuse when countess aunt begged to let ride with in future will feel easy about seeing that can both take own part stoutly well order men to be ready mounted in marketplace at half past five west gate will be opened for to ride forth at six philip have reason to be satisfied with conduct of new servant in town a at laville pierre behaved circumspectly quietly assuming grave countenance in accordance with surroundings keeping arm armour brightly polished waiting at table a orderly a if have be used to nothing else life be glad to hear sir pierre said when philip informed that must start on following morning love not town here where there be nought to do to polish armour stand behind chair at dinner time go mighty heavily will have cause to grumble on account pierre fancy for ride will be long one expect will often have roof over head better sir so long a ride finish before cold weather set in fond a be of sleeping with star over own that when snow be on ground prefer roof over head at six o'clock party started only two other gentleman rode with of whom be like count from brittany little group chatted gaily a rode along unless happened to encounter party of catholic going north to join royal army there be so far a knew chance of meeting body of enemy on westward ride town of vendome le man laval be strongly catholic devoted to guise must be skirted rennes in brittany must also be avoided for town be strongly garrisoned must turn out force far too strong for la noue to cope with upon march pierre be not only invaluable servant life of troop being full of fun frolic making even gravest soldier smile at sally when halted be indefatigable in seeing after philip comfort cut bough of tree best suited for purpose of making couch surprised master francois by ingenuity in turning out excellent dish from scantiest material must steal away in night to procure fowl egg from neighbouring farmhouse although philip order be that be to pay full price for everything required philip found when gave account fortnight later of how have spent money have given that there be mention of payment for article when rated pierre for latter replied did not pay for sir not in order to save money for sake of farmer family must have be worse than cruelty to have aroused from sleep loss of fowl two of dozen egg be nothing to if missed at must say that fox have be there must think more of if on other hand have waked up in middle of night to pay for trifle must have be scared out of life thinking when knocked that band of robber be at door in anger at being thus disturbed must have be capable of shooting be well nigh certain that at rate must have refused to sell chicken egg at time of night so see sir acted for best for party two chicken out of score be loss not worth thinking of while woman escaped panic terror that waking up must have caused when can pay will assuredly do so since be desire be sure will see that under such circumstance must be crime to wake people from sleep for sake of few sou philip laughed besides sir pierre went on people be either huguenot catholic if be huguenot must be right glad to minister to who be fighting on behalf if be catholic must rob murder without mercy therefore may think fortunate indeed to escape at so trifling cost from punishment deserve be very well pierre order be strict against plundering if admiral be to catch must get sound thrashing with stirrup leather have risked worse than sir many time in life if be caught will give leave to use strap will see monsieur philip that if war go on nicety will soon become out of fashion at present huguenot lord gentleman have money in pocket to pay for what want after time money will become scarce will see that army of king live on plunder a army generally do when cash run short will have to shut eye let men provide a best can hope war wo last long enough for pierre at rate have money in pocket at present can pay for what require though pretend that be serious matter to take hen out of coop especially when ca get otherwise without a say alarming whole family however remember order be that everything want be to be paid for understand sir will see that next time reckon up account item will be charged for so that there will be nothing on conscience philip laughed again will be content if be case pierre hope that conscience will be a clear a mine will be on third of november just month after leaving orleans de la noue with troop augmented to three hundred joined prince of conde before paris during interval have traversed west of france by route have marked out for have raised fifty more men among huguenot of brittany have be joined on route by many gentleman with party of retainer several body of catholic have be met dispersed two three small town where huguenot have be ill treated massacred be entered ringleader in persecution have be hung authority have be compelled to pay heavy fine under threat of whole town being committed to flame everywhere passed la noue have caused proclamation to be scattered far wide to effect that ill treatment of huguenot must be followed by return by heaviest punishment being inflicted upon who molested so having given great encouragement to huguenot scattered terror among persecutor having ridden great distance astonished people of western province by energy activity la noue joined prince of conde with three hundred men be heartily welcomed on arrival at huguenot camp at saint denis francois de laville philip fletcher have thoroughly enjoyed expedition have often be in saddle from early morning to late at night have felt benefit of having two horse a when party halted for day two be often sent out with troop to visit distant place to see friend to bring into camp magistrate others who have be foremost in stirring up people to attack huguenot to enter small town throw open prison carry off huguenot confined there occasionally to hang leader of local massacre in case be always accompanied by one other of older leader in command of party spare charger enabled to be on horseback day while troop rested in turn sometimes halt be made in small town village more often bivouacked in open country being thus count considered more watchful le apt to be surprised on return from expedition pierre always have meal prepared for in addition to ration of meat bread chicken egg often contrived to serve up other daintier food old poaching habit be not forgotten a soon a camp be formed must go out set snare for hare trap for bird lay line in nearest stream while fish game of sort be generally added to fare upon word count who sometimes rode with said one evening varlet of yours master philip be invaluable fellow conde can not be better served than be have mind to take away from to appoint provider in general to camp warrant never learned thus to provide table honestly must have trick of poacher at finger end fancy when be young have to shift good deal for sir philip replied thought so la noue laughed marked once twice behind chair at orleans methought then that looked too grave to be honest there be twinkle in eye that accorded badly with gravity of face sober attire well there can be doubt that in war man who have spice of rogue in make best of servant provided be faithful to master respect good if doe of one else rogue be necessarily man of resource one of kind will on campaign make master comfortable where one with over scrupulous varlet will well nigh starve have man when be with brissac in northern italy one day went out never returned whether provost marshal did ill service of hanging whether be shot by peasant never knew missed sorely often went fasting to bed when must have have good supper have be with be lucky for that have to depend upon grim visaged varlet of francois have doubt that countess thought be doing well by cousin when appointed to go with can believe that must give life for for that if have to depend upon for meal must fare badly indeed de la noue be much disappointed on joining prince at finding that latter force have not swollen to larger dimension have with after arrival of force count have brought from west two thousand horse of large proportion be gentleman attended only by few personal retainer fifth only be provided with lance large number have defensive armour of foot soldier have about same number a of horse of about half be armed with arquebus rest being pikemen force under command of constable de montmorency inside wall of paris be known to be enormously superior in strength huguenot be unable to understand why did not come out to give battle knew however that count aremberg be on way from netherlands with seventeen hundred horse sent by duke of alva to support of catholic supposed that montmorency be waiting for reinforcement on th of november news arrived that aremberg be approaching d'andelot with five hundred horse eight hundred of best trained arquebusiers be despatched to seize poissy so prevent aremberg entering paris next morning constable learning that conde have weakened army by detachment marched out from paris seldom have two european army met with greater disparity of number for while conde have fifteen hundred horse twelve hundred foot constable marched out with sixteen thousand infantry of whom six thousand be swiss three thousand horse have eighteen piece of artillery while conde be without single cannon a soon a force be seen pouring out from gate of paris huguenot trumpet blew to arm wore over coat armour white scarf distinguishing badge of huguenot horseman be divided into three body de la noue following formed part of under personal command of conde longed to be here in time for battle philip francois said think be rather more than bargained for must be nearly ten to one against there be one thing although swiss be good soldier rest of infantry be for most part parisian though gentry have proved very valiant in massacre of unarmed huguenot men woman child have belief in valour when have to meet men with sword in hand must however that d'andelot with five hundred horse eight hundred arquebusiers picked men be here with even if aremberg with seventeen hundred horse be ranged under constable a be can hardly believe that conde admiral will really lead against huge mass must think that can be going to manoeuvre so a to fall back in good order show firm face to enemy footman must then be of use to a think horse be more than twice strength might turn upon when get away from infantry beyond range of cannon a soon however a troop be fairly beyond gate of saint denis leader placed at head of three column with few inspiring word led forward coligny be on right la rochefoucauld genlis other leader on left column commanded by conde in centre conde with number of noble gentleman rode in front of line behind came men at arm with lance while armed only with sword pistol followed coligny on right be most advanced commenced battle by charging furiously down upon enemy left facing conde be great mass of catholic infantry without moment hesitation little band of five hundred horse charged right down upon fortunately for be parisian not swiss upon whom assault fell force impetus of rush be too much for parisian who broke at onset threw away arm fled in disorderly mob towards gate of paris never mind coward prince shouted there be nobler game followed by troop rode at constable who with thousand horse have taken post behind infantry before body of cavalry must advance to meet huguenot latter be among desperate hand to hand melee took place gradually huguenot won way into mass although old constable fighting a stoutly a youngest soldier be setting splendid example to troop robert stuart scotch gentleman in conde train fought way up to demanded surrender constable reply be blow with hilt of sword nearly struck stuart from horse knocking out three of teeth moment later constable be struck by pistol ball whether be fired by stuart one of gentleman by side be never known constable fell fight still raged royalist recovered from first shock be now pressing adversary conde horse be shot by musket ball in falling pinned to ground so that be unable to extricate de la noue followed by francois philip who be fighting by side other gentleman saw peril rushing forward drove back conde assailant two gentleman leaping from horse extricated prince from fallen steed after hard fighting placed on horse before one of troop repulsing attack made on fell slowly back to saint denis on right coligny have more than held own against enemy on left huguenot encountering marshal de montmorency eldest son of constable suffering heavily from arquebus artillery fire have be repulsed catholic here have gained considerable advantage flight of large portion of infantry disorder caused in cavalry by charge of conde coligny prevented marshal from following up advantage a huguenot fell back upon saint denis royalist retired into paris where wounded constable have already be carried victory be claimed by side belonged to party have lost about four hundred men matter of much greater consequence to huguenot than to catholic more so a large proportion of slain on side be gentleman of rank upon other hand loss of constable who died next day paralysed for time catholic force staunch even bigoted catholic opposed to term of toleration being granted to huguenot be opposed to ambition of guise be head of royalist party a distinguished from of lorraine catharine who be moving spirit of court hesitated to give power possessed a constable into hand might use against persuaded king to bestow supreme command of army upon brother henri duke of anjou division in court caused by death of constable question of successor prevented fresh movement of army enabled prince of conde after being rejoined by d'andelot force to retire unmolested three day after battle advanced guard of royalist having be driven back into paris by d'andelot on return when in disappointment at being absent from battle fell fiercely upon enemy pursued hotly to gate burning several windmill close under wall on evening of battle de la noue have presented cousin philip to prince speaking in high term of bravery displayed in battle have received conde thanks for part have taken in rescue from hand of catholic count have praised highly have gently chided francois for rashness have shown be well to be brave francois be not enough man who be brave without being prudent may with fortune escape a have done from battle without serious wound can not hope for such fortune many time life must be very short one several time today be length ahead of in melee once twice thought lost for be too closely pressed to render assistance be confusion alone saved life be valuable one be head of old family have right to throw life away nothing must have be more gallant than behaviour francois must learn to temper bravery by prudence cousin showed english blood breeding when charged be length behind at distance remained through fight except when be very hotly pressed when at once closed up beside more than once glanced round at be fighting with coolness of veteran be who called attention to conde fall in melee might have passed unnoticed by until be too late to save kept pistol in holster throughout fray be only when pressed so hotly a be carrying off prince that used a observed with effect doubt if there be pistol save undischarged at time be reserve that maintained for crisis of fight master philip trust that will have small opportunity for winning distinction in wretched struggle be to last heaven forbid must say that must make name for a assuredly will cousin francois if be to temper enthusiasm with coolness evening before huguenot retired from saint denis count sent for francois cousin a will have heard said retire tomorrow morning have done more than must have be expected from force have kept paris shut up for ten week have maintained position in face of force commanded by constable of france of well nigh tenfold strength be now going to march east to effect junction with force under duke casimir be to bring over six thousand horse three thousand foot four cannon march will be toilsome admiral skill will doubt not enable to elude force with enemy will try to bar way admiral be sending off sieur d'arblay whom know to south of france in order that may explain to friend there reason for movement to east for otherwise news that have broken up from before paris may cause great discouragement have proposed to that must both accompany have frequently ridden under order during expedition to west know quality have gladly consented to receive a companion will be pleasant for to have two gentleman with take with own following of eight men six of band fell in battle admiral be of opinion that be somewhat too small force for safety if take four men at arm who ride behind will double force two of yours fell in fight believe francois have taken two others from troop to fill place men came out of philip did not yes sir be wounded none of seriously be fit to ride will understand francois that in separating from be doing so for sake alone will be admiral policy to avoid fighting winter be close upon work will be hard toilsome doubtless ere effect junction with german very many will succumb to cold hardship be not a yet inured to work must rather not run risk of career ending from such cause if thought there be prospect of fighting must keep with being a be think better must accompany sieur d'arblay mission be dangerous one will demand activity energy courage of posse in south will have cold famine to contend with far greater opportunity maybe of gaining credit than must in army like where a have proved to enemy man be brave reason may own be that in case consider youth to be advantage must hardly have sent one gentleman on mission alone with two of equal rank age with eight follower difficulty dissension might have arisen while must both be content to accept order of sieur d'arblay without discussion to look up to a leader of party although must rather have remained with army lad at once thanked count stated willingness to accompany sieur d'arblay whom knew liked being like de la noue cheerful of good spirit not deeming necessary to maintain at time stern grave aspect ruggedness of manner a well a sombre garment de la noue at once took across to d'arblay tent cousin kinsman will gladly ride with place under order d'arblay can warmly commend to though be young can guarantee that will find if come to blow a useful a most men ten year senior on mission that may intrust to think that can rely upon discretion of will judge for when know somewhat more of will take with eight men at arm of whom will be stout fellow so that with own men can traverse country without fear of party be likely to fall in with will be glad to have cousin kinsman with d'arblay said courteously between de la noue must infinitely rather have two bright young fellow of spirit than one of tough old warrior who deem sinful to smile have got text handy for occasion be not very bright world for at present see not use of making sadder by always wearing gloomy countenance next morning party started rode south avoiding place held by catholic visited many of chateau of huguenot gentleman to whom d'arblay communicated instruction have received from admiral a to assemblage of troop necessity for raising such force a must compel royalist to keep considerable army in south so lessen number who must gather to oppose march eastward after stopping for short time in navarre communicating with of principal leader in little kingdom turned eastward be now passing through part of country where party spirit be extremely bitter be obliged to use caution a be charged to communicate with men who be secretly well affected to cause who living within reach of bigoted parliament of toulouse dared not openly avow faith toulouse have from time trouble first began distinguished for ferocity with have persecuted huguenot yielding obedience to various royal edict of toleration most reluctantly sometimes openly disobeying thus for many mile round city of reformed faith lived in continual dread conducting worship with extreme secrecy when pastor in disguise visited neighbourhood outwardly conforming to rite of catholic church many however only needed approach of huguenot army to throw off mask take up arm be with that d'arblay be specially charged to communicate great caution be needed in doing a visit of party of huguenot must if denounced have called down upon vengeance of parliament who be animated not only by hatred of huguenot by desire of enriching by confiscation of estate good of persecuted visit consequently be generally made after men at arm being left mile two away d'arblay found everywhere fierce desire to join in struggle restrained only by fear of consequence to wife family during absence send army capable of besieging capturing toulouse there be not one of who will not rise give blood for cause putting into field man can raise spending last crown unless force approach dare not move know that be strictly watched that on smallest pretext family must be dragged to prison tell admiral that heart prayer be with that nothing in world must please so much a to be fighting under banner until there be hope of capturing toulouse dare not move such be answer at castle chateau farmhouse where called many of huguenot contributed not only money have in house plate jewel for money be above thing needed to fulfil engagement admiral have made with german mercenary who be on march to join sometimes philip francois accompanied leader on visit

to ground therefore think a have undertaking mine can without fear return home of course leave to to decide gentleman be now free to return to home trust lesson that on part can strike if necessary will have effect in moderating zeal for persecution without word president companion walked away in body trooper began to jeer laugh philip held up hand for silence there need be extra scorn said gentleman have be sufficiently humiliated really fetched good gentleman from bed d'arblay said bursting into fit of laughter why be worth being taken prisoner be only for sake of seeing looked like number of old owl suddenly disturbed by daylight of round eyed with astonishment of hissing menacingly by faith philip will go hard with if ever fall into hand of worthy truce to joke owe life philip of there be not shadow of doubt though have more fear than of death in battle own have dread of being tortured burned be bold stroke thus to carry off men who have be leader of persecution against there be nothing in feat if can be called feat philip said of course directly heard that have be seized carried into toulouse cast about for best mean to save to attempt by force must have be simple madness other plan must have required time powerful friend knowledge of city even then must probably have failed to get out of prison being so be evident that best plan be to seize of citizen of importance who might serve a hostage there be difficulty in finding out from small cultivator who be principal men living outside wall capture be a easy business scarcely blow be struck life lost in capturing whole of of men be missing d'arblay said yes five of men be sorry to say on getting back to wood after dark sent a ordered to fetch from monsieur de merouville of course have be captured before fell into ambush be laid for be killed be bad business philip well monsieur de merouville will go with will trust in safeguard in first place have not given moment opportunity of thanking gentleman not only for having saved life of wife for forethought consideration with have in midst of anxiety for monsieur de laville shown for who be entire stranger to be assured monsieur fletcher that be deeply grateful hope that time in future must peace ever again be restored to france may be able to meet again express more warmly obligation feel towards madame de merouville added few word of gratitude then d'arblay broke in with de merouville must settle at once whether to go with stay on faith of safeguard have such protection if linger here will be having dozen troop of horse after may be sure will be sent off a soon a president friend reach city if be caught again must be in even worse plight than before do talk over with madame while be doing so francois will drink flask of wine eat anything can find here for forgot to give breakfast before sent off be likely will not have opportunity for hour what do think monsieur fletcher monsieur de merouville said after speaking for few minute with wife will respect pledge if not must go be past age when can take up life anew property must of course be confiscated must be penniless among stranger think will respect pledge philip replied assured so solemnly that breach of promise must be followed by prompt vengeance upon home that feel sure will not run risk two three among might possibly do so others must restrain believe that can safely return that for long time at rate will be unmolested still if might advise must say sell property a soon a can find purchaser at reasonable price then remove either to la rochelle cross sea to england may be sure that there will be deep bitter hatred against by whose humiliation have witnessed thank will follow advice monsieur fletcher hope may ere long have pleasure of seeing of worthily expressing deep sense of debt of gratitude owe five minute later troop mounted rode away while monsieur de merouville with wife behind started for home hope francois d'arblay said a galloped off from wood that next time ride on expedition kinsman may again be with for have wit resource render valuable companion indeed have great hope even when be in prison thing looked almost a bad a must be francois said that philip must do something to help have much faith in long headedness so have countess mother said to when started be older than philip francois will act wisely if in

of conde admiral have marched into lorraine eluding force barred march effected junction with german men at arm who have be brought to aid by duke casimir second son of elector palatine however german refused to march step farther unless received pay have be agreed upon before started conde treasury be empty have mean of satisfying demand in vain duke casimir tried to persuade soldier to defer claim to trust french co religionist to satisfy demand later on be unanimous in refusal to march step until obtained money admiral then addressed to officer soldier pointed out to at present moment everything depended upon obtaining assistance of german who be indeed only demanding right according to agreement have be made with implored to come to assistance of prince at crisis so great be influence among soldier that appeal be promptly generally acceded to officer men alike stripped of chain jewel money valuable of kind so made up sum required to satisfy german a soon a important affair have be settled united army turned face again westward with intention of giving battle anew under wall of paris be however terribly deficient in artillery powder store of kind military chest being empty soldier without pay be necessary on march to exact contribution from small catholic town village through army marched in spite of order of admiral certain amount of pillage be carried on by soldier having recruited strength of troop by short stay at orleans admiral moved towards paris since commencement of war negotiation have be going on fitfully when court thought that huguenot be formidable pushed on negotiation in earnest whenever upon contrary believed that royal force must be able to crush of admiral negotiation at once came to standstill during admiral long march to east must grant term must possibly be accepted a soon a junction be effected with duke casimir german huguenot army again turned face to paris court became eager to conclude peace when prince of conde army arrived before chartres negotiator met king professed readiness to grant so many concession that seemed a if object of huguenot must be attained without further fighting cardinal of chatillon huguenot

paris chartres admiral conde perceived that in absence of guarantee for observance of condition to other side bound treaty must be of little avail a must be broken a soon a army now menacing paris be scattered feeling among great portion of noble follower be however strongly in favour of condition being accepted noble be becoming beggared by continuance of war expense of have for most part to be paid from private mean follower indeed received pay have to be fed estate be lying untilled for want of hand men be eager to return to farm family so strong general be desire for peace that admiral conde bowed to agreed to term pending ratification raised siege of chartres already force be dwindling rapidly large number marched away to home without even asking for leave leader soon ceased to be in position to make demand for guarantee peace of lonjumeau be therefore signed provision gave very little more to huguenot than of preceding arrangement of same kind campaign left party in much same position a have occupied before huguenot took up arm chapter third huguenot war before treaty of lonjumeau have be signed many week huguenot be sensible of folly have committed in throwing away advantage have gained in war by laying down arm upon term of treaty made by perfidious woman weak unstable king with adviser bent upon destroying reformed religion have seen former edict of toleration first modified then revoked have reason even to hope that new treaty have be wrung from court by fear must be respected by huguenot be not surprised to find therefore that a soon a have sent back german auxiliary returned to home ink indeed be scarcely dry on paper upon treaty be written condition be virtually annulled from pulpit of catholic church in france treaty be denounced in most violent language be openly declared that there must be peace with huguenot a returned home be murdered in great number in many of city mob rose massacred defenceless protestant heavy a have be

by war fever hardship to one third of number have returned to chateau can not have have sens about when permitted to be cozened into laying down arm without receiving single guarantee that term of treaty must be observed far better never to have taken up arm at king have come to regard a enemy catholic hate more than ever for successful resistance instead of being in better position than be before will be in worse have given up town have captured thrown away advantage have gained when be again driven to take up arm will be in worse position than before for longer despise will in future be on guard there will be repeating surprise of last september be disappointed above in admiral d'andelot la rochefoucauld genlis conde have never trusted a one to be relied upon in extremity be royal prince have be brought up in court love gaiety ease although say not that be untrue to huguenot cause yet must gladly accommodate matter a see even in treaty great bulk of huguenot over country have be utterly deserted liberty of worship denied very life be at mercy of bigot what do think philip have have enough of fighting for party who wilfully throw away that have won by sacrifice be thinking of returning home will wait for while to see how matter go on will with permission wait philip said lament peace seems to to leave in worse position than before war agree with that can not last that ere long huguenot will be driven again to take up arm francois have become a brother until cause be lost won must fain remain be well philip will be glad to have with nephew la noue wrote to month since saying that son have borne yourselves very gallantly that be well pleased to have have with that thought that if war of religion continued might well do for long time a in germany holland a well a in france reformed religion be battling for freedom must both rise to eminence a soldier however now that peace be made must make best of must think will not be broken until after harvest vintage for until then will be employed catholic a well a huguenot must repair loss gather fund before can again take field with retainer therefore until then think that there will be peace summer passed quietly at tale of massacre outrage came from part of france filled with horror indignation in own neighbourhood be quiet rochelle have refused to open gate to royal troop a in district huguenot be too numerous to be interfered with by neighbour quiet be unbroken nevertheless be certain that hostility must not be long delayed catholic seeing advantage that perfect organization of huguenot have given at commencement of war have established league in almost province be organized by clergy party looked upon guise a leader by term of constitution be evidently determined to carry out extirpation of reformed religion with without royal authority be indeed bent upon forming third party in state looking to philip of spain rather than to king of france a leader so frequent daring be outrage in paris that conde soon found that life be not safe there retired to noyers small town in burgundy admiral coligny who have be saddened by loss of brave wife who have died from disease contracted in attending upon sick wounded soldier at orleans have abandoned chateau at chatillon sur loing where have kept up princely hospitality retired to castle of tanlay belonging to brother d'andelot situated within few mile of noyers d'andelot have gone to brittany after writing remonstrance to catharine de medici upon ruin desolation that breach of treaty persecution of section of population be bringing upon france chancellor l'hopital have in vain urged toleration adversary in royal council be too strong for cardinal of lorraine have regained old influence king appointed a preacher four of most violent advocate of persecution de montmorencys for time struggled successfully against influence of cardinal of lorraine who sought supreme power under cover of henry of anjou name three of marshal of france montmorency brother danville vielleville supported by cardinal bourbon demanded of council that d'anjou must no longer hold office of lieutenant general catharine at time aided guise at time montmorencys playing off one party against other chiefly inclining to guise who gradually obtained such ascendency that chancellor l'hopital in despair retired from council thus removed greatest obstacle to scheme ambition of cardinal of lorraine at commencement of august king despatched to part of dominion copy of oath be to be demanded from huguenot called upon to swear never to take up arm save by express command of king to assist with counsel money food who did so to join fellow citizen in defence of town against who disobeyed mandate huguenot unanimously declined to sign oath with

mile away on other side of france city be in hand of foe movement be encumbered with presence of woman young child there be one thing in favour enemy naturally supposed must attempt to escape must do so in direction of germany where must be warmly welcomed by protestant prince therefore be upon line that greatest vigilance must be displayed by enemy before starting coligny sent off very long eloquent protest to king defending for step that be about to take giving history of continuous breach of treaty of suffering have be inflicted upon huguenot denouncing cardinal of lorraine associate a guilty cause of misfortune have fallen upon france be on d of august that party set out from noyers march be prompt rapid contrary to expectation discovered unguarded ford across loire near town of laussonne ford be only passable when river be unusually low have therefore escaped vigilance of foe weather have be for time dry be enabled with much difficulty to effect crossing circumstance be regarded by huguenot a special act of providence more so a heavy rain fell moment have crossed river rose so rapidly that when few hour later cavalry of tavannes arrived in pursuit be unable to effect passage party have many other danger difficulty to encounter by extreme caution rapidity of movement succeeded in baffling foe in making way across france on evening of th of september watchman on

great victory over countess have offered to send son with fifty men at arm to swell gathering at la rochelle admiral declined offer niort be day march from chateau although population be of mixed religion catholic might under influence of present excitement march against laville thought must be better therefore that chateau must be maintained with fighting force a centre to huguenot of neighbourhood might rally think said that might for time sustain siege against force must be brought from niort if be attacked will at once send force from city to assistance have doubt that queen of

free to do what may seem best to warning only against undertaking desperate enterprise philip will of course ride with will ring alarm bell mother be better not to disturb tenantry unless on very grave occasion take fifty men at arm own men philip sixty will be ample for dispersing disorderly mob while hundred must be of use to against armed force of town garrison of two hundred men in quarter of hour troop started knew errand on be bent journey be performed at highest speed of horse be capable can have good long rest when get there francois said to philip hour earlier later may mean saving losing of fifty life mob will have be feasting exulting over slaying of so many huguenot until late last night will not be astir early morning probably too will before think of sallying out attend

with in hand impious youth bishop who be in full pontifical said must never dare to hang priest a gentleman of party have thought sin to put to death score of minister a found most holy person hounding on mob to massacre will certainly feel compunction whatever in executing order of leader to hang with other malefactor francois replied methinks that will benefit holy men more by advising with to agree to condition offer than by wasting breath in controversy with there be hasty conversation between on wall be not long before came to agreement de luc feared that must incur enmity of several powerful family if left relative for execution citizen be equally anxious to save fellow be moreover scared at threat of neighbourhood being laid waste town attacked by unknown force have appeared before have heard vague rumour of arrival of prince admiral with large force at la rochelle might well be that have turned aside on journey at news of occurrence at bishop be equally anxious

where must find safety welcome however who preferred to go to laville be assured that must be welcomed cared for there until opportunity arose for being sent under escort to la rochelle greater portion decided to make at once for huguenot city think philip have better take forty of men to act a rearguard to poor people till be within sight of la rochelle fellow whom have let free will tell on return to town that be small party be possible may send out party in pursuit think be likely townspeople have be too roughly handled to care about running risk have very large body of men at arm in town still if do pursue will be by road to la rochelle for be one will think that most of fugitive will take have not better divide troop equally francois think not will imagine will be going by road moreover of other gentleman of faith may be coming to meet with retainer twenty will be ample for do take rest two hour later philip saw cloud of dust rising from road in rear hurried on with fugitive

believe that brave gentleman must have done device of taking priest other leader a hostage boldness in summoning authority of niort under threat of hanging hostage capturing town be indeed most excellent commendable heard that number of fugitive from niort be nearly six hundred besides there be suppose from village about two hundred set out from village sir eight hundred soul hear that gentleman eight hundred soul have be rescued from torture death by bravery prudence of two young gentleman who be in year youth let be lesson to of what can be done by men engaged in good work placing trust in god there be not one of might have felt proud to have be mean of doing so great good work with so small force to have saved eight hundred life without loss of single one to say nothing of sharp lesson given to city mob that work of massacre may sometimes recoil upon who undertake good friend de la noue have more than once spoken very highly to prince respecting young count young

huguenot villager good to laville be own occurred to just a be about to start from first village entered success of military operation admiral said depends greatly upon detail be one thing to lay out general plan to think amid bustle excitement of action of detail upon success so largely depends thought of making men who be about to join in slaughter of fellow villager mean of conveying good chattel to place of safety be one show that head be cool able to think plan in moment when most men must be carried away by excitement of occasion be pleased with sir will feel that if have matter on hand demanding discretion prudence a well a bravery can in spite of year confidently intrust with be thinking of returning tomorrow to laville be intending to do so sir may be that people of niort may endeavour to revenge stroke that have dealt forty men with be necessary for defence of chateau think there be fear of attack from niort admiral said will know well enough that people be flocking here

try to make way to knew that prince must also come here if found personal safety menaced in burgundy foresaw that difficulty must be great requested that if arrived here must send word a to movement

enough to draw when number be nearly equal be fair fight will take part in slaughter of men when be twenty to one against three four men more le at nerac will make difference queen of navarre have fifty men in whenever order come to seize son may be done easily enough whether have fifty hundred with war be well enough raoul slaughtering of solitary men be not occupation that suit be good catholic hope abhor massacre of defenceless people only because want to worship in own way look to pope a head of religion on earth why must treat a mortal enemy man who doe not recognize pope authority be dangerous doctrine louis yes why must be be at colloquy at poissy saw that cardinal of lorraine bishop failed totally to answer argument of huguenot minister beza matter be utterly beyond have beza argued ten time a strongly a did must in way have shaken faith contend that if lorraine bishop must not show man to be wrong there can be nothing in people interpretation of scripture can be so terrible a to deserve death if become dangerous to state be ready to fight against a against other enemy of france can see nothing can excuse persecution massacre if men be enemy of france of a yet proof have be shown be because have be driven to by persecution louis cousin other said be dangerous indeed in day to form opinion must remember greatest statesman l'hopital have fallen into disgrace have be deprived of rank dignity because have be advocate of toleration know that raoul also know there be number of noble gentleman who although staunch catholic be sickened at seeing king acting a tool of philip of spain pope who shudder a do at beholding france stained with blood from end to end simply because people choose to worship god in own way must remember that people be not ignorant scum of town that among be large number of best wisest head will fight le staunchly when fighting have to be done because be convinced that be wrong if be in arm against king must be in arm for hope none le that when arm be laid down there will be cessation of persecution at rate cessation of massacre be bringing disgrace on in eye of europe trust that there may be league made among to withstand guise to insist that there will be in france repetition of atrocity by philip of spain duke of alva be trying to stamp out reformed religion in netherlands well hope at rate louis cousin said impatiently that will keep opinion to yourself for assuredly will bring into disgrace may even cost possession head if be uttered in presence of friend of guise chapter jeanne of navarre be lucky philip said to jacques a proceeded on way after troop have ridden on that did not think of asking if be huguenot be expecting sir jacques said be just turning over in conscience how must answer there must be one answer jacques though doubt must have cost life must not deny faith even to save life sir if question be put to 'be huguenot think that when four life be at stake be lawful to take opening there may be to get out of how must there have be opening jacques well sir see if have asked 'be huguenot ' think must have said 'no with clear conscience seeing that be englishman religion may be like ours be not huguenot although pierre doe not seem to to have quite made up mind a to what be assuredly must not call huguenot so see sir that a only two out of four be huguenot there must have be lie to saying ' to question if have said 'be catholic ' must have answered 'no seeing that none of go to mass be nice question philip said seeing that catholic never keep oath promise to what call heretic think that one must be justified not in telling lie for nothing can justify in availing one self of loophole such a one must scorn to use to others must be sorry to have question asked though seeing be not huguenot although be fighting with think must reply 'no especially a be not question of own life only one involving whole cause of huguenot if be in place know must do so a say that must do without conscience pricking certainly must not put pressure upon to say 'yes however hope may never be asked question that will meet with more interruption until get to nerac there can be little doubt that at present catholic have received order to seize queen son at although have order to prevent at cost from going forward to paris except under escort be keeping sharp lookout to prevent from being joined by party of huguenot who must render force formidable must hope that by time be past last of band met just now doubtless belonged to force gathered in bazas be in direction of north

ride with pierre asked hope to join again tonight be going through agen where hope to gather such news of movement of catholic troop a may be of use to agen be about fifteen mile distance from nerac a there be occasion for haste philip did not wish horse to have appearance of being ridden fast took three hour in traversing distance when neared town said to pierre will not take with if there must be trouble though see how can well come about four men must do more than one therefore pierre do follow nearer than be sufficient to keep in sight other two will follow at equal distance together

escape be beside single handed might get through trust to speed of horse if taken might plan mode of escape in case must hamper be there above be important that mission must be fulfilled therefore command on head be strict apprehend trouble in way if must occur will at once turn horse down first street come to so that may in way be connected with pierre will of course turn first will follow see where stable horse then go on to other cabaret having put up horse go back to place where have stopped wait till join outside then arrange for hour at be to meet again then go off in different direction to gather news of be in search take further thought about at give whole mind to safety of queen upon depends greatly issue of war be son to fall into hand of catholic must be fatal blow to cause so saying rode on again at head of party when within quarter of mile of town again called pierre up to pierre do take ring dagger must be taken will assuredly be searched to see whether be

to that danger here be a nothing to that have often run before yet must have sort of foreboding of evil if be not huguenot must vow score of pound of candle to be burnt at shrine of holy virgin if master get safe out of yonder town philip rode on across bridge entered gate without question up to time follower have kept close behind now in accordance with instruction dropped behind continued way to principal square rode up to inn entered courtyard gave horse to stableman give feed said put in stable will not require until afternoon then went into public room called for food wine sat down table be well nigh full for there be many stranger in town after first glance at newcomer none paid attention pierre two men have in accordance with instruction passed inn have seen enter put up at other place there be loud buzz of conversation philip listened attentively to between four gentleman who have just sat down at next table to three of have come in together fourth joined just a philip meal be brought to well have heard news at governor maignan one of asked last comer bad news conde admiral be not letting grass grow under foot have captured not only niort a heard yesterday parthenay peste be bad news indeed what blunder be to let slip through finger when might have seized with two three hundred men in burgundy seems to that be making just same mistake here put in a jeanne of navarre be well nigh a dangerous a admiral why seize cub carry to paris because hope that will go willingly of own accord saint amand la motte fenelon have be negotiating with for last fortnight on behalf of court be clearly far better that must go there of own will than must be taken there prisoner doing so must seem desertion of huguenot cause must be tremendous blow to on other hand if be taken there a prisoner must drive many huguenot to take up arm who be now content to rest quiet moreover protestant prince of germany elizabeth of england must protest for court may say of admiral can hardly affirm that jeanne of navarre be thinking of making war against charles for other reason than defence of faith besides can do harm at nerac can always lay hand on when like at rate there be fear of getting farther north river be too well guarded for know said after way in conde admiral though hampered with woman child made way across france must never be surprised at anything see there be not place where have not friend pestilent huguenot be everywhere will get warning of danger guide across country peasant who know byroad through field willow in river must be far better to make sure of son by seizing at nerac besides saint amand said there be report of movement of huguenot over guyenne heard rumour last night that seneschal of armagnac have got considerable gathering together huguenot seem to spring out of ground six week ago one believed that there be corner of france where must gather hundred men together now be everywhere in arm think maignan said that need not be uneasy about queen of navarre be not at liberty to say what have heard fancy that before many hour will be on way to paris willingly unwillingly a for seneschal others will be hunted down a soon a matter be settled day two sooner later will make difference there until queen be taken troop will have to stay in present station only fear be that seeing can have hope of making way north will slip away back to navarre again once there must not be taken without deal of trouble be to be done must be done promptly without direct order from court step can be taken in so important matter order may arrive hour think will see that there will be loss of time in executing nerac must not stand long siege even if be strongly garrisoned handful of men have got with must not defend wall for hour hope may not take alarm too soon for a say once back in navarre must be difficult indeed to take be joke hunting bear among mountain a people be devoted to must play hide seek among valley hill for week ay month before must be laid hold of be well for cause maignan that be not man must be a formidable foe a admiral huguenot a be one ca help respecting husband be poor creature beside be ready to swallow bait offered while even if must seat son on throne of france must not stir hand breadth from what think right philip finished meal then went out into square news be satisfactory order have yet arrived for seizure of queen though one be evidently looked for to arrive in course of few hour must then be too late to take step until at earliest by nine o'clock queen must have left nerac movement be intended at present against seneschal did idea that queen might attempt to join seem to be entertained be possible however that suspicion might have occurred to governor that troop might secretly be sent off later must try to learn something more confident that must not be suspected of being ought what appeared catholic gentleman for garment be of much brighter hue than affected by huguenot strolled quietly along pausing looking into shop when happened to pas near group of soldier gentleman talking together so spent two three hour word have reached ear indicating that of speaker be anticipating sudden call to horse saw that pierre be following keeping at distance away pausing whenever paused saw sign of other two men doubted not that be a have ordered spending time in wine shop frequented by soldier listening to talk feeling convinced that order have be given for assembly of body of troop sat down for time at small table in front of one of principal wine shop called for bottle of best wine thinking that fact that be alone must be le noticeable so than if continued to walk street presently party of four five gentleman sat down at table short distance off did not particularly notice at first presently glancing way saw one of looking hard at thrill of dismay ran through a recognized gentleman addressed a raoul leader of party have stopped near bazas have however presence of mind enough to look indifferently at then to continue sipping wine possibility that gentleman with troop must have come to agen have never entered mind though encounter be most unfortunate one trusted that complete change in appearance must be sufficient to prevent recognition although be evident by gaze fixed on that gentleman have idea that face be familiar to move now must heighten suspicion if existed therefore sat quiet watching people who passed in front of revolving in mind best course to be taken must raoul address latter have just spoken to cousin who be sitting next to do know that young gentleman louis asked seem to know face well yet doe not know for just now glanced at without recognizing know most of gentry in neighbourhood do know can not say that do raoul though too seem to have recollection of face be sort of face one remembers too must think family must belong to north for often see men of complexion about here look very young not above nineteen twenty there be look of earnestness resolution about face must point to being year older dismissing matter from mind raoul joined in conversation round presently grasped cousin arm know where saw face now louis be one of four fellow stopped two day since near bazas impossible raoul men be peasant though two of have served for time in army others stopped see louis one of others be dark active man other be lad tall well built young fellow with fair complexion gray eye thought of afterwards wondered where got that skin hair from put down that be trace of english blood of there be good deal still left in guyenne of other province held long ago certainly see likeness now mention raoul can hardly be same be gentleman be certainly that whoever may be how must gentleman be masquerading about a peasant be what be going to find out louis may have be huguenot making way down to join queen of navarre at nerac may be one of train there who have gone out in disguise to reconnoitre country see what force of ours be in neighbourhood where posted may be mission here time have chosen to come in proper attire can hardly be attire if be one of jeanne of navarre follower may have got suit for purpose assuredly colour be too gay for huguenot in train for part see nothing suspicious about appearance there be paying reckoning going be going after raoul said rising there be something strange about affair there may be plot do come with louis monsieur d'estanges have little matter of business on hand will come with chapter escape from prison glancing half round a turned away from wine shop philip saw raoul two of companion rising walked off in leisurely manner few pace farther turned down side street heard step following then voice said hold young sir must have word with philip turned with expression of angry surprise be addressing sir must have know be not accustomed to be spoken to in fashion that bear insult from one raoul laughed be equally particular sir when be going about in peasant clothes be not good at riddle sir philip said haughtily can only suppose that object be to pick quarrel with though be not conscious of having given offence however that matter little suppose be one of gallant who air bravery when think can do so with impunity on present occasion may perchance find that be mistaken be stranger here know of place where matter can be settled be provided with second be quite content to place in hand of one of gentleman if will act for be sure raoul there be mistake louis began putting hand on cousin shoulder other shook off angrily be of passionate overbearing temper philip coolness manner in have turned table upon challenged to duel inflamed to utmost hand off louis said do think that raoul de fontaine be to be crowed over by youth have challenged to fight fight will provoked louis said firmly gave provocation such a gentleman of honour must suffer be not for came out with because said that wished to unravel what may be plot will cut will be easier than unravelling raoul replied be shorter easier work to finish matter with sword thrust than to provide for being swung at end of rope have best waste time in empty braggadocio philip said coldly proceed at once to quiet spot where matter can be settled undisturbed think young gentleman be right monsieur d'estanges gentleman of court said gravely matter have gone too far for anything else now be bound to say that adversary of whose name be ignorant have borne in manner to merit esteem that a cousin will of course act for will be happy to place service at disposal let get beyond gate raoul said abruptly turning on heel retracing step up lane to main street thank sir for offering to stand by one of whose very name be ignorant philip said a accompanied by monsieur d'estanges followed others be however right that must know be philip fletcher on father side be english on mother be of noble french blood being cousin to francois de laville whose mother mine be daughter of count de moulins two distinguished family of poitou monsieur d'estanges said courteously needed not that to tell that be of good blood regret much that encounter be going to take place monsieur raoul de fontaine be in wrong in so rudely hailing can not blame for taking up sharply although seeing age that be good swordsman might have be more prudent to have overlooked manner unless indeed smiled monsieur raoul be right that be engaged on weighty matter here preferred to run risk of getting killed rather than have inquired into countess of laville son be staunch huguenot may well be on business here that must not care to have investigated have not asked name sir be charles d'estanges be cousin of duc de guise be naturally of court party can esteem brave enemy regret to see one engaged in encounter in must need be overmatched be fair swordsman sir philip said though arm may lack somewhat of strength will have few year later have be otherwise must have still taken course have say conjecture be correct one at rate must prefer most unequal fight to being seized questioned one can be killed once be better that must be by thrust in open air than long imprisonment ending perhaps with death at stake monsieur d'estanges said more in spite of relationship with guise like many other french catholic noble disapproved of persecution of huguenot especially of massacre perpetrated by lower order in town men for whom have profoundest contempt felt sorry for companion whose youth fearless demeanour moved in favour who doubted not have come to agen to confer with of huguenot who be to be found in town issuing from gate went for quarter of mile along road then raoul led way into small wood here without word being spoken raoul philip threw aside cloak doublet gentleman monsieur d'estanges said surely quarrel might be arranged without fighting monsieur de fontaine addressed principal doubtless under misapprehension with roughness be not unnaturally resented if monsieur de fontaine will express regret certainly must do without loss of dignity for manner in spoke principal must be sure gladly accept apology be opinion also louis de fontaine said have already expressed to cousin have already said that will hing of sort raoul said be fighting not only in own quarrel in of king being well assured in mind that young man whether be a now appears gentleman of birth whether a saw last peasant boy be engaged in plot hostile to majesty then there be nothing more to be said monsieur d'estanges said gravely before begin may tell monsieur de fontaine that gentleman belongs to family no le noble than own have confided to name position think a well not to divulge now louis may a well stand aside have done best to stop quarrel to prevent what can not consider most unequal contest from taking place last word be galling in extreme to raoul de fontaine monsieur d'estanges stood high at court be gentleman of unblemished reputation often appealed to on question of honour declaration that considered combat to be unequal one be more irritating since be conscious of fact however must not recoil now with angry expression of face drew sword stood on guard philip be le ready easy attitude assumed with weight for most part on left leg differed so widely from forward attitude then in fashion among french duellist monsieur d'estanges convinced that knew nothing of swordplay shrugged shoulder pityingly moment however that sword grated against other philip put aside with sharp turn of wrist lunge with opponent intended at once to finish combat expression of face changed lad did not speak boastfully when said be fair swordsman muttered to doe not fight in fashion at least know what be about for minute fight continued raoul temper rising higher higher a found attack baffled by foe have despised who refused to fall back even inch however hotly pressed have at first intended either to wound disarm soon fought to kill at last there be fierce rally ending by philip parrying home thrust returning with lightning swiftness running raoul de fontaine through body with such force that hilt of sword struck against chest sank lifeless to ground by lady young gentleman monsieur d'estanges exclaimed have done well said that be fair swordsman truly be of highest class raoul temper have led into many duel have always wounded killed man who must have thought that must receive death blow at hand of youth whom have here peste be awkward a spoke count darbois governor of agen with body of trooper rode up have ridden to within mile two of nerac questioning person from town learned that everything be quiet there that fresh body of huguenot have arrived be on way back when hearing clash of sword have ridden into wood to inquire into meaning what be exclaimed why what be monsieur de fontaine cousin count raoul dead louis who be leaning over cousin looked up ala fear that be so monsieur le comte poor cousin have fallen in duel what misfortune at moment be not scandalous that at time like when gentleman sword be needed in defence of king faith must indulge in private quarrel be monsieur d'estanges who have done majesty bad service for by time philip have resumed doublet cloak no only stood a second to opponent who have behaved fairly honourably in matter a be sure count louis will testify word be quite sufficient monsieur d'estanges who be gentleman who have thus slain one who have mean reputation a swordsman young gentleman passing through agen quarrel arose through rencontre in street count raoul be a be nature hasty put in wrong gentleman resented language meeting be at once arranged count louis be with raoul a opponent be alone be not desirable to draw others into matter offered to act a second accepted at once came here count louis made final effort to persuade raoul to apologize for language refused to do so fought see consequence who be stranger governor asked again count raoul did not feel necessary to ask count think a waived point affair be now terminated must be well that opponent must be permitted to withdraw without question be very well for monsieur d'estanges a party in private quarrel a governor of agen be duty to satisfy a to who stranger who have killed officer of king may be turned horse for first time obtained view of philip who seeing impossibility of escape have be standing quietly by why be youth exclaimed say slew count raoul in fair fight monsieur d'estanges in a fair fight a ever saw monsieur le comte who be sir governor asked philip be stranger travelling through agen on private business philip said quietly what be name family sir be english philip replied name be philip fletcher huguenot will be bound governor said angrily not at count be of religion of nation protestant be same thing governor said be clear that for purpose may be in agen be here for good be serious matter monsieur d'estanges a have said know nothing of gentleman count saw for first time little over hour ago on account wish have not seen have killed friend raoul deprived majesty of staunch adherent have got into trouble for be assured by conduct bearing in business that be honourable gentleman intreat a personal favour count that allow to go free must do much to oblige monsieur d'estanges be englishman protestant by own confession therefore can only be here to aid men who have risen in rebellion to conspire with king enemy will be placed in close charge when present pressing affair have be put out of hand doubt not will find mean of learning good deal more about mysterious person who claim to be english who yet speaks language like frenchman a to that matter can satisfy at once philip said mother be french lady daughter of count de moulins of poitou huguenot family if mistake not governor said coldly well have other thing to think of now captain carton place two trooper one on side of person authorize to cut down if try to escape let four others dismount carry body of count de fontaine into city will of course take command of troop count louis seeing that if mistake not be nearest relative heir to possession a philip be led through street caught sight of pierre who made sign of recognition a passed be taken to castle confined in room in turret looking down upon river window be closely barred otherwise room though small be not uncomfortable contained chair table couch illustration philip in prison when door be barred bolted behind philip walked to window stood looking out at river prospect seemed dark governor be unfavourably disposed towards now when news came on morrow that queen of navarre have slipped through finger exasperation must doubt be vented on what be now mere suspicion must then become almost certainty must a matter of course be assumed that be there on matter connected with flight that be protestant be alone sufficient to condemn to death connection with queen flight must beyond question seal fate pierre felt sure must do that must for must amount to almost nothing even if have mean of filing through removing bar must need long stout rope to enable to descend to water edge hundred foot below that must obtain possession of file rope seemed to a absolutely impossible nevertheless said to will let pierre know where be confined see that can do good be fellow of resource have great faith in though can see possible plan of escape being without may try something have doubt that first endeavour will be to find out where be confined warrant will know cap if see have eye like hawk if see anything outside one of window will suspect at once that be signal when once look closely at will make out orange tint three long cock feather so saying thrust one of arm through bar with cap allowed to hang down against wall below there stood for two hour closely examining boat came along at last saw one rowed by two men with third sitting in stern have difficulty in making out a came closer that be pierre who be gazing at castle presently saw suddenly clap hand speak to rower did not look up continued to row on in same leisurely way a before did pierre again glance at castle satisfied that signal have be observed philip withdrew continued to watch boat went mile higher up then turned floated quietly down stream again when have seen pas bridge threw down on couch there be nothing more for to do said matter be in pierre hand now listened for time to tramp of sentry backwards forward outside door then fell off to sleep from did not awake until heard bar withdrawn key turned in lock then man accompanied by two soldier entered placed chicken bottle of wine loaf of bread on table monsieur d'estanges sends with compliment said then philip be again left alone two hour after became dark thought heard confused sound a of trampling of number of horseman in courtyard of castle went to door placing ear against be convinced that be not mistaken that look a if expedition be about to start somewhere said if be bound for nerac will arrive there too late for queen will by time be setting out can not intend to scale wall tonight gate will have be shut long ago be probably going into ambush somewhere near so a to ride in in morning wish must be certain be bound in direction there be certainly idea of expedition morning be possible that messenger with order for arrest of queen prince may have arrived afternoon governor be losing time trust be so not news have come from spy at nerac that will leave place tonight if be so party may be setting out to strengthen guard on river to occupy road by must travel be purpose to join seneschal trust pierre others be on alert not wasting time in thinking about that if troop make along river will ride to warn queen in time hearing nothing will assume that road be clear that can go on fearlessly be enough to drive one mad being cooped up here when whole success of cause be at stake character of sentry walk have changed have be relieved four hour before walk at time ceased a if be leaning against wall to rest while at time gave impatient stamp with foot expect have forgotten to relieve philip said to if strong body have gone out that might very well be half hour passed then heard step ascending stone staircase sentry exclaimed angrily sapristie comrade began to think be going to be kept night at post that everyone have ridden out with party started hour ago now then order be 'permit one to approach refuse even to allow officer to visit prisoner without special order of governor be now be off for tankard of spiced wine think have earned well for be good hour after time of relief then philip heard footstep descending stair while man who have relieved walked briskly up down in front of door in minute two stopped then philip turned with start from window at be standing a heard through keyhole loud whisper monsieur philip be asleep be why pierre exclaimed running to door putting mouth to keyhole how did come here will tell that later master thing be now to get out bolt here be easy enough to draw lock puzzle have brought up two thin saw auger thought to cut round there be plate of iron outside there be one inside too pierre how about hinge pierre there be doing anything with master ironwork go right across door there be nothing for to cut right round iron plate wo take very long if saw be good pierre philip heard rasping sound in short time auger passed through woodwork two other hole adjoining first be soon made then end of saw be pushed through if can make hole large enough at bottom of plate pierre pas other saw through can work way to meet must take too long to make sir have plenty of oil wo take long to saw round plate only brought second saw in case first must break oak be pretty nearly a hard a iron took over hour work before cut be complete when be nearly finished pierre said be ready to seize piece be cut out a soon a be through with master otherwise may fall down a door open make clatter will be heard over castle a last piece be sawn through philip pressed door a opened seized portion cut out drew backward laid gently on stone floor then rose grasped pierre hand brave pierre have accomplished what thought be impossibility now what be next thing to be done next thing be to unwind rope from body be lucky be so lean that did not make look bulky be not very thick be new strong there be knot two foot roger be waiting for below in boat where be jacques jacques have ridden off learned before sunset that order have be issued for troop to assemble

battlement lowered other down will go first master be lightest will steady rope for from below in two three minute philip felt that rope be no longer tight at once swung over lowered down water washed foot of wall stepped directly into boat roger be keeping in place with pole while pierre held rope exclamation of thankfulness broke from two men a foot touched gunwale of boat then without word roger began to pole boat along against tide keeping close to foot of wall once fairly beyond castle pole be laid in two men took oar boat shot across river then rowed up under opposite bank until voice from above said be well be monsieur philip with be well jacques philip exclaimed delighted for fact that follower be there showed that troop have gone in direction did not threaten safety of queen leapt ashore pushed boat off to allow to float down with stream be mile to spot where horse have be left on way philip heard how escape have be effected saw go out from town monsieur must not for life of make out what be going to happen did not know gentleman be walking with recognized two in front of a officer of troop have questioned near bazas one of be talking angrily to other a seemed to that be going willingly not a prisoner especially a be going out of town thought that be business to wait until returned saw hour later horseman coming up street someone said that be governor who have be out with party gave bad turn when saw walking a prisoner in middle of saw glance at of course made sign followed until entered castle when be walking away saw crowd pushing forward found be surrounding four soldier who be carrying body on shoulder made out at once be officer who have be talking so angrily to companion then understood what have puzzled before what have gone outside wall for rest be easy to guess governor have come along have be questioned have be arrested a huguenot be evident that time be to be lost that if be to be got out must be done quickly hurried away to cabaret where jacques roger be drinking talked matter over agreed that first thing be to get four horse out of town so went to inn where have put up said be servant paid reckoning took away horse then got own joined other two who be mounted ready took horse rode off settling to leave at farmhouse short distance away explaining there that town be so full must find room for directly have started set off to

do understand rightly monsieur fletcher that have slain raoul de fontaine in duel be case philip replied monsieur d'estanges a have said acted a second count louis de fontaine acted for cousin will

unwilling to give battle unless in position afforded advantage for movement of cavalry in be greatly superior in strength to huguenot admiral be equally determined not to throw away advantage possessed in large force of infantry after being in sight of other for time several skirmish having taken place army fell back into winter quarter severity of weather being too great to keep soldier without tent other shelter in field during operation philip cousin have again ridden with francois de la noue who have rejoined army after most perilous march in small body of troop have brought from brittany have succeeded in making way through hostile country in crossing ford of intervening river after hard fighting considerable loss a soon a intense cold have driven army to shelter of town

francois now that portion of anjou army be lying at poitier may must weather break make raid into country a laville be nearest point to poitier held for might well make dash at countess welcomed back

field for month after month men be longing to be back to farm family will have to keep keen lookout through winter fortunately harvest here be good one granary be full so that will be able to keep men at arm on through winter without much expense feel more anxious about tenant than about yes mother there be doubt there be considerable risk of enemy trying to beat up must arrange for signal so that people may have time to fall back here philip will think over ought to be able to contrive scheme between do so francois feel safe against surprise here never retire to rest without wondering whether night will pas without tenant farm stack being set ablaze family slaughtered on own hearth stone suppose francois philip said to a stood at lookout next morning there be not much doubt way must cross hill coming from poitier must be almost sure to come by road that travelled by when went to chatillon come down over hill two mile to west there be see just catch sight of a cross that shoulder land doe not go a far a doe no only extends mile in direction four mile in other five mile out into plain be there many huguenot on other side of hill yes there be a know strength be in other direction

must of course be kept night day must advise tenant to send up a much of corn hay a possible at once that cattle must be driven up close to chateau at night think must be very good plan philip be sure that among men at arm must be who have acquaintance friend on other side of hill will be best that must make arrangement for firing of signal beacon might even station one of in village there under pretence that have be knocked up with cold hardship be desirous of staying quietly with friend must watch at night must sleep by day a friend must waken at once if troop passed along same afternoon

harness on night day have cart in readiness close to house then when signal be given woman will only have to bundle good child into cart while men get arm prepare to drive in cattle catholic will show mercy to of faith may find while a to chateau can make stout resistance may be sure that will not be long before help arrives from niort la rochelle arrangement be also made with huguenot gentry in

be driven off by boy men to arm mount of course countess said at council where arrangement be made must be guided by number sent against if by uniting band together think can raise siege will sally out a soon a attack join attack unless think that united force can defeat if must defeat must save chateau farm from fire ruin if find be too strong to attack might harass party sent out to plunder so save house while despatch men to ask for help from admiral if however be so strong in cavalry that must not keep field against must say be best that must ride away join party advancing to assistance

of hill so that flame must not be seen from other side have be at philip suggestion if be put where can see said will feel sure that be in answer to fire behind will ride at full speed so a to get here before news spread if see answering fire may suppose that first be accident may even halt at village send off men to see what have caused fire if ride straight through will be at little distance before simon have got to fire lighted may not care to waste time sending back at rate be better that must see flame up here have often talked matter over have agreed that even if column be composed only of cavalry must be from hour half to two hour before arrived at chateau a must doubtless have performed long journey while if there be infantry with must take double time directly alarm have be

through gate man have be placed there to mark off name of who entered from list have be furnished philip took saw that cross have be placed against name therefore went up to top of wall tenant be in francois very well then will have drawbridge raised gate closed be glad indeed that have have time given for to enter mother must have be very grieved if harm have come to of have everything in readiness here have posted men at window loophole where house rise from side of moat rest be on wall will take command here by gate along wall do take charge of defence of house however may a well stay here with until have have first talk with pas word along wall for perfect silence in half hour heard dull sound presently became louder must distinguish above trampling of horse clash of steel came nearer nearer until within two three hundred yard of chateau then ceased presently figure must be made out creeping quietly forward until reached edge of moat paused moment then retired have be sent to find out whether drawbridge be down francois whispered to philip will see what will do now there be pause for ten minute then heavy mass of men must be seen approaching doubtless will have plank with to push across moat philip said will let come within twenty yard francois replied then think will astonish believing that in chateau be asleep that even precaution of keeping watchman on wall have be neglected assailant advanced eagerly suddenly silence on wall be broken by voice shouting give fire then from along whole face of battlement deadly fire from arquebus be poured into moment later dozen fireball be flung into column rain of crossbow bolt followed shout of astonishment rage pain broke from mass breaking up recoiled in confusion while shout of officer urging forward must be heard heavy fire from wall be however too much for men who have expected no resistance have moved forward believing that have to sack plunder in two three minute from first shot being fired who be able to do so have retired though number of dark figure dotting ground showed how deadly have be fire of besieged will hing more tonight fancy one of huguenot gentleman standing by two friend remarked expected to take entirely by surprise now that have failed in doing so will wait until morning to reconnoitre decide on best point of attack besides doubt have marched far be in need of rest before renewing assault well gentleman francois said must be needle for to remain here when once begin in earnest there will be slight opportunity of rest until relief reach therefore beg to go below will find table laid in hall two chamber roughly prepared for can get few hour sleep with own men will keep watch must muster for attack horn will summon again to wall philip will go down see that gentleman have that require can dismiss save own men from guard on other side of house tenant men will sleep in hall philip went down presided at long table gentleman be seated near while below tenant other follower took place there be enough cold meat game pie for when have finished defender of wall came down half at time for meal when gentleman have retired to apartment farmer men have thrown down upon rush strewn on side of hall philip went up to join francois sign of francois none at expect be thoroughly tired out be lying down just a halted there be fear that will hear more of tonight chapter assault on chateau night passed quietly just a sun rose trumpet sounded calling for truce two knight in armour rode forward followed by esquire carrying white flag halted thirty forty yard from gate countess herself came up on to wall when knight raised vizor countess amelie de laville summon in name of majesty king to surrender have with ample force to overcome resistance gracious majesty in clemency have empowered to offer to within wall life save only that son will accompany to paris there to be dealt with according to law under accusation of having taken up arm against most sacred majesty methinks sir countess said in loud clear voice that must have be better have delayed until morning instead of attempting like band of midnight thief to break into chateau fancy must have heard little of majesty clemency have succeeded in attempt be in arm not against king against evil counsellor men who persuade to break pledged word to treat unoffending subject a if be worst of malefactor assuredly royal highness prince of conde navarre have thought of opposing majesty desire above thing that must be able to act without pressure from lorraine guise from pope king of spain when lay down arm will be glad to do so did know that king of own mind have sent here to summons must willingly accompany to paris to clear from charge brought against a base attempt without summons demand to break into chateau last night show that can have authority from majesty to enter here refuse to open gate will defend place until last against who may attack knight rode away have after rough reception on arrival perceived that countess be determined to defend chateau have only summoned to surrender a matter of form must have never entered upon expedition de brissac told that house be poorly fortified thought must assuredly carry last night by surprise that by taking obstinate dame prisoner burning chateau sweeping country round must give much needed lesson to huguenot of district one must not have expected to find place crowded with men everyone ready with lighted match drawn crossbow to receive believe now that fire saw two three mile in rear a came along be signal even if be one must not have given credit for gathering so promptly to withstand a for place be a heard of great strength 't be modern house inclosed on three side with wall twenty foot high surrounded by moat of same width with force must carry in hour know that garrison consists of only fifty men besides score so of groom servant so heard be mistaken if there be not more than double that number engaged on wall still a say there will be no great difficulty in carrying place ladder will be ready in couple of hour de beauvoir will bring in from farmhouse plenty of plank beam for throwing bridge across moat be two hour since set out with horseman so a to catch huguenot farmer asleep a returned to spot where men be engaged in cooking breakfast while be occupied in constructing ladder from young tree have be felled for purpose gentleman rode in what be news de villette news be bad de beauvoir asked to ride in to tell that find farmhouse completely deserted whole of cattle horse have disappeared a well a inhabitant save for pig poultry have not seen living thing sapristie huguenot dog must have slept with one eye open heard firing last night at once made off must have learned be coming must have gathered in chateau measure must have be indeed well planned carried out for to have got alarm in time to gather here before arrival hope be what have done for reckoned upon carrying off at least thousand head of cattle for use of army be for a much a to capture countess strike blow at hive of huguenot that expedition be arranged however if be in there will save trouble of driving in in case though de brissac fifty men will have be reinforced by a many more at least ay maybe by hundred fifty with farmer hand be hundred fifty rustic fifty men at arm against force de brissac have guessed pretty accurately number of fighting men must be mustered among tenant of countess training that have undergone have however made more formidable opponent than supposed man be animated by hatred of persecutor stern determination to fight until last in defence of life freedom of worship have be mustered at first dawn of day in courtyard arm inspected deficiency made up from armoury fifty men be placed under philip order for defence of portion of house rose directly from edge of moat lower window be small strongly barred there be little fear of entrance being forced postern gate here have during night be strengthened with stone article of heavy furniture piled against few men be placed at lower window main body on first floor where casement be large rest distributed at upper window to vex enemy by fire a approached philip appointed eustace to take command of men at lower window roger of on upper floor with jacques posting on first floor against enemy must attempt to fix ladder great fire be lighted in room cauldron of water placed over boy with pail stood by in readiness to bring boiling water to window when required wall round courtyard garden be not of sufficient thickness for fire to be lighted along narrow path on defender be posted fire be lighted in courtyard boiling water prepared there in readiness to carry up when assault began huguenot gentleman be placed in command at various point along wall most likely to be assailed have besieger be provided with cannon defence must not have lasted long for wall must not have resisted battering by shot cannon in time be rare be too clumsy heavy to accompany expedition requiring to move with speed for time men at arm alone garrisoned wall farmer men being occupied in pumping water from well carrying to cattle of eight hundred have be driven in granary be opened plentiful supply of food placed in large trough at ten o'clock trumpet called defender to post enemy be drawn up in order moved towards house in six column two taking way towards rear to attack house on side while others advanced toward different point on wall ladder long plank be carried at head of column a approached assailant halted arquebusiers came forward took post in line to cover by fire advance of storming party a soon a advanced heavy fire be opened by besieged with crossbow arquebus parapet be high while exposed only head to fire be altogether sheltered while loading assailant be completely exposed order be given that defender must entirely disregard fire of matchlock men must direct aim upon storming party suffered heavily urged forward by officer gained edge of moat pushed plank across placed ladder a fast a be put into position be hurled down again by defender who with long forked stick thrust out from wall hurled backwards sometimes allowing to remain until line of men have climbed up then pouring pail of boiling water over wall upon farmer vied with men at arm in steadiness of defence being furious at sight of column of smoke rose in many direction showing that cavalry of besieger be occupied in destroying homestead sometimes when four five ladder be planted together assailant managed to climb up to level of parapet only to be thrust backward with pike cut down with sword ax for two hour assault continued then de brissac seeing how heavy be loss how vain effort to scale wall at point ordered trumpeter to sound retreat when besieger drew off galled by fire of defender until be out of range attempt of two column have attacked house be attended with greater success than of fellow effort to gain footing in of room on first floor having be defeated with heavy loss leader of assailant held consultation after troop have drawn off be of use de brissac said to repeat attack on wall be too stoutly defended be out of question for to think of returning to poitier undertook to capture place to harry farm to destroy huguenot to return driving in cattle for use of army of have only so far burned farmhouse have lost something like couple of hundred men time must try by fire men must gather bundle of firewood must attack in three column principal against great gate others against two postern one at back of house other nearest angle where wall join if have time to construct machine for battering wall must be easy business be out of question in couple of day at latest will have coming out like swarm of hornet from la rochelle be not likely when have measure so well prepared that omitted to send off word at once to coligny by tomorrow at noon may have conde admiral upon therefore must make end of by have better plan to suggest gentleman there be reply several of present have be wounded more le severely terribly bruised by being hurled back from ladder a led troop to assault five six of young noble who have joined what regarded a expedition likely to meet with slight resistance have be killed regretted that have embarked upon affair must bring small credit while be unprovided with necessary mean for attacking place so stoutly defended de brissac at once issued order strong party of soldier scattered proceeded to cut down fence bush to form large faggot movement be observed by men placed on summit of tower doubt be entertained of intention of enemy what do think have better do philip francois asked a stood together at top of tower watching catholic at work may shoot number of if be determined will certainly be able to lay faggot in case will be open to attack at three point likely enough will at same time renew attack on wall be most dangerous part of philip said ought to have difficulty in holding three entrance postern be narrow forty men at must be able to keep back host must leave hundred twenty to hold main gate if have to man wall too matter must be serious if have time might pull down one of outbuilding build thick wall behind gate in hour will be attacking again stood thinking for minute two then exclaimed have francois let at once kill number of cattle pile carcass up two deep against gate may burn down if like then can hing against pile of flesh weight of carcass will keep in solid mass at rate might do at two postern great gate be perhaps too wide lofty if formed barricade inside of say three body high hundred men ought to be able to defend will leave hundred for wall house be capital idea philip will not lose moment in carrying out two of principal tenant be called up told to see to slaughtering instantly of sufficient cattle to pile two deep against postern calling number of men together at once set about business will see to other barricade ourselves philip be where fighting will be entrance behind gateway be twenty five foot in width a much in depth before entered courtyard bullock be brought up to spot slaughtered there first line be about to be dragged into place when philip suggested that must be skinned what on earth do want to skin for philip francois asked when be arranged in row must throw skin over again inside out weight of next row will keep skin in place will be impossible for anyone to obtain footing on slippery surface especially if pour blood over francois at once saw point of suggestion excellent philip wish brain be a full of idea a yours be same course be pursued with other two tier of carcass hide of upper row being firmly pegged into flesh to prevent being pulled off breastwork be about five foot high be absolutely unclimbable must not be better francois said solid work must not be half so difficult to get over twenty men here must keep host at bay tier of unskinned carcass be laid down behind breastwork for defender to stand on earth be piled over to afford footing have just completed preparation when trumpet from above sounded signal that enemy be approaching took post that have before occupied enemy approached a have expected in three body preceded by detachment carried in front of great faggot served a protection against missile of besieged among be men carrying sack what can have there philip asked one of huguenot gentleman must say be earth replied earth philip repeated puzzled what can want that for must think be to cover plank thickly before lay down faggot otherwise plank must burn perhaps fall bodily in water before fire have done work on door doubt be philip agreed did not think of before a soon a head of column approached within hundred yard men with arquebus opened fire with crossbow speedily followed suit four hundred men with arquebus at once ran forward until within short distance of moat opened so heavy fire against defender of wall house that be compelled to stoop down under shelter of must have still gone on firing from window philip ordered to draw back be of use throwing away life said can not hope to prevent planting faggot firing went up into small turret partly overhanging wall through loophole watched men at work content of sack be emptied out upon plank latter having be first soaked with water drawn from moat by pail one of men carried earth be levelled foot deep then score of bucket of water emptied over then faggot be piled against door torch be applied to a soon a be done assailant fell back defender plying with shot cross bolt a soon a did so philip now paid hasty visit to wall here assailant have suffered heavily before have planted faggot defender being better able to return fire than be at window in case however have succeeded in laying firing faggot although much hindered at work by pail of boiling water emptied upon ten of defender have be shot through head a

stupidity to put up with tiresome people never to have one own way in anything however suppose turn will come at present must rather be hunting wild goat in navarre than pretending to be general in chief of army when everyone know that be not even a free to go own way a common soldier will look to see again chevalier philip will expect to have more good story to tell having handed despatch

over by emigre of bravery of young englishman who be held in marked consideration by admiral coligny have won name for even among noble gentleman who rode with dashing officer de la noue whose fame be second only to of admiral walsingham english ambassador at paris have heard of from la noue when be prisoner there mentioned in one of despatch saying that be gentleman who have be chosen by coligny

make acquaintance of with whom will naturally associate when take up residence on estate uncle have bought for have mother grievance against might be different have none fletcher have be yeoman here for many generation in own rank esteem a good a best never thought of pushing out of own station in ordinary course of thing must have lived died a father have done change have come about first through marrying french wife of noble blood though with small share of world good secondly through sister husband making large fortune in trade adopting a heir thirdly through going out to mother relation distinguishing in war thus stand in altogether different position to held be man with estate be noble on mother side be knight have gained approval of great captain prince therefore be only meet right that must take place among gentry must be not only churlish to refuse to accept civility now altogether in opposition to course uncle planned for philip therefore accepted civility offered to be invited to entertainment at many of great house in part of county where indeed be made good deal of fine figure ease courtesy of bearing reputation have gained for bravery rendering general favourite at end of six month received letter from cousin urging to return spring have now begun philip at present thing be going on quietly king seems determined that peace will be kept constable montmorency be still very high in favour guise be sulking on estate huguenot noble be well received at court where go in number to pay respect to king to assure of devotion have be there with mother king be mightily civil congratulated on having be knighted by coligny be present at majesty marriage with daughter of emperor of germany show be very fine one everything pleasant there be report that in order to put end to further trouble to bind party in friendship king have proposed marriage between sister marguerite henry of navarre trust that will take place for will indeed be grand thing for of reformed faith be rumoured that queen jeanne be by mean eager for match fearing henry once at paris will abandon simple custom in have be brought up may even be led away by influence of marguerite court to abandon faith first fear think be likely enough to be realized for seems to that have be brought up somewhat too strictly being be sure naturally fond of pleasure be likely enough to share in gaiety of court of paris a to other fear can not think there be foundation for henry be certainly ambitious very politic have talked often freely with when have be alone together have spoken once twice of chance of succeeding to throne of france be not great seeing that three life stand between now that king have married be more remote than before still there be chance once said to 'one thing seems to to be certain francois supposing charles of valois two brother died without leaving heir france must not accept huguenot king there must be guise priest papacy spain thrown in scale against ' 'that be likely enough prince ' said 'and methinks lot must be preferable a king of navarre to of king of france however happily there be reason for supposing that king two brother will die without heir did not speak for time sat there thinking know way have methinks philip that when come to man estate be king of navarre guise will find in very different opponent to deal with than leader of huguenot have be so far admiral be so honest loyal truthful that be ill fitted to match subtlety of queen mother deceit falsehood of guise queen of navarre be heroine saint although wise woman be match for intriguer conde be gallant soldier hated politics henry of navarre will be opponent of sort when first knew thought frankest simplest of young prince be what most think still be sure be much more than having be about person for month being youngest of companion most of whom be stern earnest huguenot noble be great deal with talked with a did not with others seems to that have two character one what seems to be light hearted merry straightforward outspoken other thoughtful astute ambitious politic studying men closely adapting to mood pretend to understand at be altogether beyond be sure will be great leader day think must understand better than must know think so too of course have own duty through campaign saw little of more than once said ' wish have english cousin with like much laville cousin be more like must learn much of be brave merry good tempered so be have longer head than have ' know be quite true 'you must be quite content to spend life at court francois where must make good figure must take thing a come must not if did not like thing must intrigue must look below surface must join party must be capable of waiting biding time be only seventeen francois be of thing most important for prince to learn to read men to study character be getting on 'your cousin be not ambitious must never conspire for own advantage must be invaluable minister adviser to prince in difficulty admiral meant well be wrong in refusing to let have philip fletcher when be own master will have if can catch suppose that will because of very fault of not being ambitious have made own plan be bent a told on returning to england nothing can offer will be sure alter determination be pity great pity by see philip that who think prince of navarre merely merry careless young fellow who be likely to rule little kingdom in patriarchal fashion to trouble with nothing outside so long a subject be contented allowed to worship in own way be likely to find sorely mistaken however if come over soon will be able to judge for queen of navarre saw great deal of countess mother when be at la rochelle together have invited to pay visit at bearn prince have requested to accompany of course if come over will go with will be sure of hearty welcome from henry will have good hunting there be court grandeur certainly no more state than have at chateau in fact good mother be much more important personage there than be jeanne of navarre at bearn letter hastened philip departure prospect of hunting in mountain of navarre be pleasant one liked young prince have in short time have be companion perceived that there be much more in than appeared on surface that beside frank bonhomie manner there be fund of shrewdness common sense moreover without being ambitious be pleasant for young man to know that one who may day be great prince have conceived good opinion of took francois ' letter down to uncle gaspard read portion of to gaspard sat thoughtful for time after have finished be new to said at last believed general report that henry of navarre be frank careless young fellow fond of chase like mother averse to court ceremony likely enough to make good soldier without ambition without marked talent if what francois say be true seems that be inclined to agree with may make great difference in future of france misfortune of huguenot hitherto have be that have be ready to fall into trap that court of france might set for on strength of few hollow promise to throw away advantage have gained by effort courage in spite of experience that promise be always broken a soon a laid down arm in such unequal contest must always be worsted honest straightforward be match for men who have truth conscience if have leader a politic astute a queen mother guise might possibly gain end if henry of navarre turn out wise politic prince ready to match foe with own weapon may win for huguenot what will never gain with own sword mind will hardly thank for wife mother must be horrified be to say that a catholic henry of navarre must be able to do vastly more to heal long open sore to secure freedom of worship for huguenot than ever must do a huguenot indeed quite agree with what say that a huguenot can never hold throne of france philip uttered exclamation of indignation can not think uncle that will ever change religion know nothing about beyond what cousin say philip there be huguenot huguenot there be men who must die at stake rather than give up one iota of faith there be men who think that reformed faith be better purer than catholic who nevertheless must be willing to make considerable concession in interest of peace must remember that when prince princess marry generally embrace faith of husband when lately queen elizabeth be talking of marrying prince of anjou made one of condition that must turn protestant demand be not considered to be insurmountable may be that time will come when henry of navarre may consider throne of france freedom of worship general peace cheaply purchased at cost of attending mass if doe so doubtless huguenot must be grieved indignant so far a be concerned must be best thing of course be only talking now of what might do must nought religion stand between throne of france a king of navarre simply interest must be other way must doubtless remain staunch huguenot of course philip be speaking without knowing young prince be simply arguing a to what astute politic man in position not over earnest a to matter of faith must be likely to do three day later philip rode to london with pierre embarked for la rochelle uncle have amply supplied with fund father insisted upon taking handsome sum from although did not require much money before philip gaspard told that did not draw from agent at la rochelle third of sum have placed for in hand will be different now have expense before save pay of men cost of food own in time of peace there be many expense must not that

here who can say how long will last one thing be certain must war break out again will centre round la rochelle might be once more forced to leave chateau at mercy of royalist must then be folly to spend crown upon doing more than be sufficient for necessity only keep such retainer a be absolutely necessary for service there be eight horse in stable rest be out on farm must trouble recommence

be many engagement never becomes marriage guessed how must be that night after have saved mademoiselle claire life thought so still more when be staying at valecourt then thought ran too fast pierre mademoiselle de valecourt be great heiress count must of course give in marriage to one of own rank pierre shrugged shoulder almost imperceptibly honour be doubtless right said humbly therefore seeing that have father monsieur de pascal to protect need not trouble more about article of attire stowed away on roof above will be able to concern solely with own safety put much better complexion on affair whole matter be ridiculous pierre philip said angrily be fool to have listened to there go see about breakfast will lose patience with altogether there be several consultation during day between leading huguenot there be apparent ground for suspicion that attack upon admiral have be part of general plot be believed that be outcome of animosity of guise queen mother against man who have long withstood who be now higher than in king confidence who have persuaded to undertake enterprise must range france on side of protestant power balance of evidence be in favour of truth of supposition to effect that be only upon failure of scheme against admiral that conspirator determined upon general massacre of huguenot worked upon weak king mind until persuaded that coligny be at head of plot against that nothing short of death of follower must procure peace quiet for france at last in sudden access of fury charles not only ranged on side astonished catharine anjou companion by going even farther than have done declaring that huguenot must be killed sudden change subsequent conduct during few month remained to of life seem to point to fact that fresh access of trouble shattered weak brain that be not fairly responsible for event followed guilt of rest wholly upon catharine de medici henry of anjou leader of party of guise philip spent considerable portion of day at louvre with henry of navarre francois de laville few of young king closest follower there be shadow of disquiet in mind of of doctor reported that admiral state be favourable although must have be glad to be on way south regarded detention of few day a matter of little importance listening to talk about court entertainment pleasure philip quite shook off uneasiness be angry with for having listened to pierre prognostication of evil huguenot lord know france parisian better than do said to thought of danger occurs to be not even thought necessary that few of must take up abode at admiral have faith in king protestation pledge for safety philip dined at louvre be ten o'clock before returned to lodging be in excellent spirit saluted pierre with laughing inquiry well bird of ill omen what fresh plottings have discovered believe master when tell pierre said gravely oh then there be something new philip said seating on couch let hear about pierre will try not to laugh will descend with to door monsieur philip assuredly will if will please though what be going to show there can not imagine pierre led way downstairs out through door do see that sir yes see that pierre what do take to be sir well be not too dark to see what be pierre be small white cross that urchin have chalked on door will please to walk little farther sir there be cross on door there be none here neither on next here see then door without one now sir doe not that strike a curious well know pierre boy might very well chalk door a went along leave others untouched yes sir there be one very remarkable

there be huguenot be strange certainly pierre philip said struck alike by fact by earnestness with pierre expressed be quite sure of what say be quite sure sir returned here at nine o'clock saw mark on door did not pay much heed to went upstairs then a thought over said to myself 'be freak of passerby be sort of signal ' then thought must see whether house alone be marked whether there be cross on other door went to house of several gentleman of party on of door be white cross then looked farther found that other house be unmarked at of knocked asked for one other of friend in case heard be mistaken for huguenot be lodging there illustration that cross be placed there by design be evident sir that be not thing of chance that cross be placed there by design philip went down street satisfied that pierre have spoken correctly then returned to lodging pausing however before house of count de valecourt erasing cross upon entered own door without touching mark pierre who followed in rubbed sleeve of doublet across unnoticed by master then followed upstairs philip seated thoughtfully like not mark pierre there may be nothing of importance in fanatic may have taken trouble to place cross upon door cursing a did so at same time can not deny that may have be placed there for set purpose of be ignorant hitherto there have be nothing to give foundation to fancy here be at least something tangible whatever may mean what be own idea own idea be sir that intend to arrest admiral follower that king while speaking fair be really guided by catharine have consented to plan for capture of huguenot lord who have come into trap can not believe that act of black treachery can be contemplated pierre europe must cry out against king who inviting number of noble to marriage of sister seized that occasion for imprisoning may not be done by sir may be work of guise agent among mob of paris that intend to massacre a did at rouen score of other place a have done here in paris more than once be a hard to believe a other pierre own supposition be by far most probable that be work of fanatic at rate will be on watch tonight be too late to do anything else be to go round to friend must mock at for paying attention to trifle a chalk mark on door own think serious because have come in spite of reason to believe somewhat in foreboding one else seems to entertain such fear

paused be gone must not be right for to go with will take to louvre where will crave protection of king queen of navarre think ungrateful for what have done for twice now have saved life understand philip do said honour scruple one of object in sending pierre down into town again be to learn what have taken place at louvre may be that fiendish massacre have extended there that even king of navarre huguenot gentleman with have shared fate of others must not be so must be best in way that what suggest must be carried out a for sieur de pascal may be that blow have bereft of good father may well have fallen upon also many will surely escape a have done can not be that friend who rode in with prince can have be murdered have doubtless escaped fear that massacre will be almost universal for have evidently be carefully planned once begun will extend not only to follower of navarre to protestant within wall of paris do know aught concerning sieur de pascal claire asked looking up something in tone of voice struck saw fall mademoiselle have made for door of house doubtless with intention of joining father in defending to last murderer be already there be attacked on doorstep be surrounded well nigh spent when saw tried to reach through crowd before must do so fell then seeing that must be throwing away life destroying chance of saving yours hurried away to carry out plan have before formed of making way along roof so entering house monsieur de pascal fell mademoiselle a brave soldier fighting against host of foe in defence of father be unfortunate though noble impulse led there for have rubbed out mark upon door served a guide for soldier count might have escaped over roof before attack be made have not presence aroused suspicion claire have hidden face in hand a began to speak have kept on talking in order to give time to collect feeling a be now cry unrestrainedly went quietly out of hut left to herself glad that tear have come to relief for first time hour later door opened behind claire called in be better now said have be able to cry seemed that heart be frozen be like one in terrible nightmare now know that be true that dear father be dead a for monsieur de pascal be sorry that brave soldier have be killed be know received a affianced husband simply in obedience to father command that heart have part in god have broken tie for even in time of sorrow can not feel relief at moment there be knock at door then latch be lifted pierre entered what be news pierre be bad king have in truth put at head of massacre even in louvre several

be sent to part of france to exterminate huguenot philip made sign to pierre to leave hut be terrible news said to claire be now clear that louvre will afford protection in day no more mercy be shown to woman than to men at best at worst must save life by renouncing faith have already decided said quietly must not go to louvre death of monsieur de pascal have altered everything a affianced wife with consent of father king must hardly have interfered to have forced into marriage being now free must treat a ward of crown must hand estate to one of favourite anything must be better than now of course be out of question estate have none for with extermination of people estate will be granted to others a to mademoiselle have be trying to massacre huguenot for year though doubtless in town many may fall will not be taken so readily in country may even yet rally make head again still that doe not alter present circumstance see other plan have first formed for to accompany servant in disguise girl stood hesitating twining finger over other restlessly be so strange so unmaidenly murmured then claire philip said taking hand in must give right to protect be strange to speak of love at time a know that love a rich heiress altogether above station even have be free might never have spoken now standing a do surrounded by danger such distinction be levelled love with heart seems to that god have brought together be surely so philip said looking up into face have not god sent twice to save day will tell of heart not now dear not now be alone in world save be sure that father if now see must approve therefore philip henceforth be affianced wife be ready to follow to end of world philip stooped down kissed gently then dropped hand stood back little apart from be best called

wife be a must be master pierre said then stepping up to claire who held out hand to reverently pressed with lip mademoiselle said life will henceforth be at disposal a at that of master may have danger to face if anyone can get through can thank pierre girl said be well indeed that must have with one so faithful attached a in hour passed before philip related to claire how pierre warning have excited uneasiness how discovery of chalk mark on door have confirmed in conviction that evil be intended explained step have taken for providing for escape from city have be wondering vaguely philip said when have told story how be that must have appeared so suddenly must have disguise in readiness for how must have guessed must be ready to go with for first time slight tinge of colour came into cheek be scarcely guess claire be rather despairing hope seemed to that amid terror confusion might in way be able to rescue made only preparation that seemed possible knew that be aware that loved when told of engagement felt that be saying farewell to when thought of saving be for not for for knew that must never oppose father wish did not dream of general calamity a have be thought only of rising of mob of paris that perhaps hour two in disguise might be sufficient until king troop restored order be very wonderful claire said earnestly seems beyond doubt that be god who have thus given to will not doubt great a danger may seem to be before will lead safely through will make for la rochelle yes once there will be safe may be sure that there at least cruel order of king will be wholly disregarded a may hope will be in many other town in huguenot be numerous at la rochelle certainly be rest of france in flame people must remain steadfast believe that power of huguenot will be broken may be that in northern town order of king will be carried out from thence have obtained aid in former struggle strength in south will still remain though loss of so many leader noble here in paris will be heavy blow hope that cause of faith will speedily rally from make head again just a did when seemed lost after battle of moncontour so talked until night fell with pierre sitting discreetly in
