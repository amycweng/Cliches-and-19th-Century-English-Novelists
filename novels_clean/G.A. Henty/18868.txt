so gregory hartley wife went out to alexandria established in three bright room in upper part of house commanded view of port sea beyond outlay required for furniture be small indeed matting for floor few cushion for divan ran round room bed few simple cooking utensil small stock of crockery sufficed mr ferguson manager of branch have at first read letter gregory have brought with doubt in mind a to wisdom of principal in sending out man who be evidently gentleman feeling however soon wore away found perfectly ready to undertake work to be set there be indeed nothing absolutely unpleasant about be at office early saw that native swept dusted office rest of day be either in warehouse carried message generally did such odd job a be required fortnight after arrival one of clerk be kept away by sharp attack of fever a work be pressing agent asked gregory to take place will do best sir know nothing of mercantile account work will be in way difficult mr hardman will take mr parrot

something better mind work bit said to wife if only for sake of boy son have be born few month after arrival must try to raise in scale bit have nothing to complain about at office far from from what manager said to other day if vacancy occurred in office must have offer of berth of course must be step for know from book that hardman get two hundred year be forty more than do must like to get something else gregory trouble to think that time be spent packing up good in warehouse work of sort even if got le must much rather even if have to stint ourselves that work be more suitable to past such that must associate again with gentleman on even term doe not trouble dear except wish have society among lady however for sake boy own must like will certainly keep on lookout for better position have often regretted now did not go in for commission in army did want to father must not hear of by time with luck might have got company though pay must not have be more than get here must with quarter so on have be a much must be in very different social position however be of use talking about now indeed be difficult to make plan at thing be in such unsettled condition here that there be saying what will happen see arabi military party be practically master here tewfik have be obliged to make concession after concession to to dismiss minister at order to submit to series of humiliation at moment arabi must dethrone a have whole army at back certainly larger portion of population revolution must be completed without trouble bloodshed see be complicated by fact that tewfik have support of english french government there can be little doubt that populace regard movement a national one directed a much against foreign control interference a against tewfik against whom have ground of complaint on part of army general trouble have arisen solely on account of favouritism shown to circassian officer once revolution have commenced be certain to widen out peasantry be everywhere fanatically hostile to foreigner attack have be made upon in various country district must arabi be triumphant position of christian will become very precarious matter be evidently seen in light in england for heard today at office that british french squadron be expected here in day two if there must be row position here will be very unpleasant must hardly think that arabi must venture to try strength against of fleet fancy that trouble will in first place begin in cairo a being capital of country beyond reach of armed interference by power arabi natural course must be to consolidate power throughout whole of egypt leaving alexandria severely alone until have obtained absolute authority elsewhere anyhow will be satisfaction to have fleet up a at first rumour of outbreak can get baby on board one of ship lying in harbour a simple measure of precaution must suggest that must go out with evening buy one of costume worn by native woman be only long blue robe enveloping from head to foot one of hideous white cotton veil falling from below eye will get bottle of iodine will then only have to darken forehead eyelid must pas unsuspected through crowd what be going to do gregory will get native dress too must remember that though if possible will come to may not be able to do so in case hear of tumult going on must take baby go down at once to port know enough of language now to be able to tell boatman to take off to one of steamer in port a soon a get away will go round port will find without difficulty still anticipate trouble arising without having sufficient warning to allow to come see settled on board ship can then keep on in office until close when can join again of course be very remote trust that occasion will never arise still there be doubt that situation be critical there be harm in making preparation for worst at rate dear beg that will not go out alone till matter have settled down will do shopping together when come back from office there be one thing have reason to be grateful for even if worst come to worst christian have to leave country object for came out here have be attained have not heard cough for month have laid by fifty pound have written forty story long short if go back have fair hope of making way for be sure that write better than used to do a good many of story be laid in local colouring will give distinctive character be more likely to be accepted than wrote before editor of magazine like succession of tale of kind for present there be doubt that arrival of fleet will render position here more comfortable than be at present mere mob of town must hesitate to attack european when know three four thousand sailor must land in hour on other hand arabi general might see that alexandria be after most important position that be here foreign interference must be arrested must not be surprised if on arrival of ship tewfik arabi leader of movement come here at once tewfik will come to get support of fleet arabi will come to oppose landing of troop war in beginning of century be decided at alexandria may be so again if be sure that must come to harm think chance of be very small own that must be immensely interesting break to monotony of one life here one thing be fairly certain if there be anything like regular row commercial work will come to end until matter be settled in case even if office be not altogether closed whole staff recalled to england must be glad enough to allow to leave instead of keeping to two year agreement that signed before starting must hardly think that there must be tumult here gregory native seem very gentle peaceable army be composed of same sort of men have be kept down for century annie there be deep fanatical feeling in mussulman nature at rate great proportion of officer of army be mussulmans a for kopts there must be no danger of trouble from cry of 'death to christian must excite mahomedan in land almost to madness unfortunately too there be general belief whether truly founded not that although french representative here be apparently acting in concert with ours french official be secretly encouraging arabi will take active step in case be doubtful whether england must act alone jealousy between two people here be intense for year french have be thwarting at turn may very well think that however matter might finally go interference must make so unpopular in egypt that influence must become completely paramount supremacy in egypt have always be dream of french have not be for command of sea must have obtained possession of country in napoleon time intrigue here have for year be incessant newspaper in egypt have continually maligned believe that time have come when will be real if not nominal ruler of egypt making of suez canal be quite a much political a commercial move have certainly added largely to influence here though in respect check be given to by purchase of khedive share in canal by lord beaconsfield stroke however greatly increased enmity of french here heightened effort to excite animosity of people against well hope that come of question a to whose influence be to be paramount in egypt will be finally settled even french domination must be better than constant intrigue trouble keep land in state of agitation however fancy that will be other way if english fleet come here there be trouble think will back down if begin in earnest be sure to win in long run france must see that if refuse to act at last moment can only be because arabi have in power to produce document showing that be all along acting in accordance with secret advice week later on th of may squadron of england france anchored off alexandria british fleet consisted of eight ironclad five gunboat carrying three thousand five hundred thirty nine men one hundred two gun commanded by sir frederick seymour two day before approach of fleet be known at cairo french english consul proposed that khedive must issue decree declaring general amnesty that president of council minister of war three military pasha must quit country for year request be complied with ministry resigned in body on day fleet arrived on ground that khedive acquiesced in foreign interference great meeting be held of chief personage of state officer representative of army at once told khedive that refused to obey order only recognized authority of porte at alexandria trade ceased at once when became known that troop be busy strengthening fort mounting cannon preparing for resistance that be done by order of arabi who be now practically dictator there must be question native population became more more excited being firmly of belief that vessel must resist fire of heavy gun that attempt on part of men of war to reduce place must end in being sunk a soon a fighting began office store be still kept open gregory duty be almost nominal mr parrot who be also married be told by manager that must spend greater portion of time at home part of gregory duty consisted in going off to vessel came into port with good for firm seeing to being brought on shore have difficulty in making arrangement with captain of one of ship for wife child to go on board at once must there be trouble in town if hear sound of tumult annie must disguise at once go down to wharf have arranged with boatman allen whom know well a have often gone out with for sail in evening that if hears of outbreak will bring boat to step at end of street take off to simoon of course will come if can house be one of have be marked off a being most suitable for defence men from dozen other establishment be to gather there a belonging to house must aid in defence of course if get sufficient warning will slip on disguise hurry here see down to boat then make way back to place wait for if come here find that have gone will know that have taken alarm in time will return at once to office of course if outbreak commences near here find that way down to water be blocked will simply put on disguise stain face wait till come to till see that way to water be clear attempt to go out into mob there be not likely to be woman among however anticipate serious riot may attack european in street with fourteen fifteen men of war in port be not likely to make organized assault arabi agent will hardly precipitate matter in way hard a may work will take month to get defence into proper order rising will be merely spasmodic outbreak of fanaticism think danger be likely to be pressing until finding that remonstrance be vain admiral begin to bombard port will do exactly a tell gregory if be alone must not bring to leave without must think of child quite so dear be first consideration certainly if come to fight must be much more comfortable with knowledge that baby be in safety egyptian soldier be quartered for most part outside town for day there be danger that must enter attack european inhabitant arabi order be strict that until gave command be to remain quiet british admiral sent message to tewfik insisting that work upon fortification must cease latter again issued order to effect be wholly disobeyed have indeed shadow of authority remaining work continued night day be however a much a possible concealed from observation search light being suddenly turned upon fort at night showed to be swarming with men thing went on with comparative quiet till th of june although attitude of native be so threatening that european left house except on urgent business on day sudden uproar be heard pistol be fired merchant closed store barricaded door gregory be in harbour at time jumping into boat rowed to stair hurried home found that wife have already disguised be in readiness to leave street be full of excited people slipped on own disguise darkened face then seizing moment when crowd have rushed up street at sound of firearm at other end hurried down to boat rowed off to simoon must return now dear said can get in at back gate have key a store be brought in through way think that need feel uneasiness row be evidently still going on only few gun be being fired now certainly rascal can not be attacking store must hear steady musketry fire by sound riot be principally in foreign quarter where maltese greek italian congregate doubt police will soon put down police however made attempt to do so permitted work of massacre to take place under eye nearly two hundred european be killed majority of dwelt in foreign quarter several merchant others be set upon while making way to office seaman from fleet be also among victim british consul be dragged out of carriage severely injured consulate be attacked several frenchman be killed in street khedive hurried from cairo on hearing news arabi be now sending of best regiment to alexandria while pretending to be preparing for raid upon suez canal be receiving assistance of dervish pasha sultan representative have be recognized by sultan who conferred upon highest order of medjidie in meantime conference have be held by power be decided that sultan must be entrusted with work of putting down insurrection being nominally lord paramount of egypt condition be laid down a to army leaving country afterwards sultan sent evasive reply khedive be too overwhelmed at situation to take decisive course france hesitated england determined that with without ally must take matter in hand chapter rising in harbour be full of merchant ship a there be at present mean of getting cargo unloaded native boatman have for most part struck work have be willing to man boat must have remained idle a in view of situation merchant felt that good be much safer on board ship than must be in magazine be settled therefore that for present annie child must remain on board simoon while gregory must take up residence at office fleet in harbour be now imposing one not only be english french squadron there italian ship of war have arrived united state cruiser on th of july sir beauchamp seymour sent in decisive message that must commence bombardment of fort unless strengthening of fortification be at once abandoned heed be taken of intimation three day later sent ultimatum demanding cessation of work immediate surrender of fort nearest to entrance to harbour stating that if term be not complied with in twenty four hour bombardment must commence already greater part of european inhabitant have left town taken up quarter in merchant ship have be engaged for purpose few however of banker merchant determined to remain gathered in bank in mr ferguson house to most valuable good in other establishment be removed have ample supply of firearm believed that must hold out for considerable time be convinced that egyptian troop must not for hour resist fire must be opened upon must speedily evacuate town that therefore there must only be mob to be encountered for short time a sailor must land a soon a egyptian troop fled egyptian on other hand believed absolutely in ability to destroy fleet party be wrong european greatly undervalued fighting power of egyptian animated a be by confidence in strength of defence by number by fanaticism while egyptian similarly undervalued tremendous power of ship that evening next morning port presented animated appearance boat be putting off with inhabitant who have waited on hoping that egyptian must at last moment give in many of merchantman have already cleared out others be getting up sail smoke be rising from funnel of men of war express boat have brought from france order that french fleet be to take part in proceeding be to proceed at once to port said order excited bitterest feeling of anger humiliation among french officer sailor who have relied confidently in taking part in bombardment silently ship one by one left port italian american vessel remained for time a british ship followed in stately order crew manned rigging vociferously cheered sailor who replied a heartily save british men of war took up station well out at sea in direction where must be out of fire of egyptian battery be not until nine o'clock in evening that two last british ship invincible monarch steamed out of port at past four in morning ship got under weigh again moved to position marked out for fort mex battery on sand hill be faced by penelope monarch invincible alexandra superb sultan faced harbour fort ada pharos ra el teen temeraire inflexible prepared to aid invincible in attack on fort mex to support three battleship engaged off port a might be required five gunboat moved away towards fort marabout lay distance to west of town at seven o'clock alexandra began engagement by firing single gun then whole fleet opened egyptian artilleryman replying with great steadiness resolution there be scarcely breath of wind ship be in few instant shrouded in own smoke be frequently obliged to cease firing until drifted slowly away to enable to aim gun rattle of machine gun added to din midshipman be sent aloft signalled down to deck result of shot so that gunner be enabled to direct fire even when must not see ten yard beyond muzzle of gun in short time fort battery showed how terrible be effect of great shell embrasure be torn widened there be great gap in masonry of building hail of missile from machine gun swept spot near egyptian gun yet arabi soldier did not flinch in spite of number fell worked gun a fast a ever have be accustomed to huge krupp gun in battery combat must have be more equal although end must have be same ship must have suffered terribly fortunately egyptian artilleryman have little experience in working of heavy piece shot in almost case flew high sometimes above mast sometimes between in only few instance striking hull with smaller gun made good practice though shot from piece frequently struck dropped harmlessly from iron side only that entered through porthole effected damage condor under lord charles beresford be first to engage fort marabout for time little gunboat be mark of gun of fort other four gunboat speedily came to assistance effectually diverted fire of fort from ship be engaging fort mex at eight o'clock monarch having silenced fort opposite to dismounted gun joined inflexible penelope in duel with fort mex by nine o'clock gun be silenced except four two of be heavy rifled gun well sheltered in spite of heavy fire from three great ship egyptian soldier maintained fire officer frequently exposing to bullet of machine gun by leaping upon parapet to ascertain effect of own shot harbour fort be by time crumbling under shot of four warship opposed to pharos suffered most heavily gun be absolutely silenced while fire from other two fort slackened considerably at half past ten be seen that ra el teen palace lay behind fort be on fire hour later fire from fort fort ada almost died out british admiral now gave signal to cease firing a smoke cleared away effect of five hour bombardment be visible fort battery be mere heap of ruin gun must be made out lying dismounted standing with muzzle pointing upwards ship have not come out scatheless injury be for most part immaterial although rigging have be cut away bulwark smashed side dinted one gun of penelope have be disabled two of alexandra only five men have be killed altogether twenty seven wounded sign be made of surrender occasional fire be kept up on fort to prevent egyptian from repairing damage at one o'clock twelve volunteer from invincible started to destroy gun of fort mex fire have ceased men be to be seen in fort might have be lying in wait to attack landing party on nearing shore surf be found to be too heavy for boat to pas through major tulloch six men swam ashore entered fort be found to be deserted gun two ten inch piece dismounted charge of gun cotton that swimmer brought ashore with be placed in cannon muzzle blown off after performing very gallant service little party swam back to boat british admiral position be now difficult one there be sign of surrender for aught must tell fifteen thousand egyptian troop might be lying round ruined fort in town hard by in readiness to oppose landing that troop be not to be despised be evident by gallantry with have fought gun force must be aided by mass of population must be hazardous indeed to risk loss of fifteen hundred men reversal of success already gained at same time be painful to think that european on shore might be massacred whole city destroyed by exasperated troop fanatical population be known that number of englishman there be not large two three hundred at most there be much larger number of lower class of european port labourer fisherman petty shopkeeper others who have preferred taking chance to certainty of losing little possession if left anxiously glass of on board ship be directed towards shore in hope of seeing white flag hoisted boat come out with flying there be sign of intention of defender fleet prepared to resume action in morning fort marabout several of battery on shore be still unsilenced two heavy gun mounted on moncrieff system by gun rose to level of parapet fired instantly sank again have continued to fire day in spite of effort of fleet to silence next morning however there be long heavy swell ironclad be rolling too heavily for anything like accuracy of aim a party of men must be seen at work in moncrieff battery fire be opened upon speedily evacuated night palace of ra el teen burned fiercely great fire be raging in heart of town anxiety for on shore for time overpowered feeling of exultation at victory have be gained at half past ten white flag be hoisted at pharos battery on board watched with deep anxiety what be to follow lieutenant lambton at once steamed into fort in bittern to enquire if government be ready to surrender be three o'clock before steamed out again with news that mission be fruitless that white flag have only be hoisted by officer in command of fort to enable men to get away unmolested lieutenant lambton have obtained interview with military governor on behalf of government told that be not at war with egypt have simply destroyed fort because threatened fleet that have condition to impose upon government be ready to discus proposal that troop must be allowed to evacuate fort with honour of war be most unfortunate that fleet have not brought with two three thousand troop have done so must have landed at once saved great portion of town from destruction a have soldier admiral must not land portion of sailor a large egyptian force in town be still protected by number of land battery might fall upon at five o'clock helicon be sent in to say that white flag must not be noticed unless hoisted by authority if be again shown british admiral must consider sign of general surrender be long time before helicon returned with news that communication have be received from enemy that barrack arsenal seemed to be deserted a far a must be seen whole town be evacuated a evening wore on fresh fire broke out in part of town steam pinnace be sent ashore to ascertain if possible state of affair mr ross contractor for supply of meat to fleet volunteered to accompany harbour be dark deserted not light be to be seen in house near water crackling of flame must be heard with occasional crash of falling wall roof on nearing landing place pinnace paused for two three minute for on board to listen a be quiet steamed alongside mr ross jumped ashore boat backed off few yard quarter of hour later returned that quarter of town be entirely deserted have pushed on until arrested by barrier of flame great square be on fire from end to end european quarter generally be in flame must see by litter strewed street that house have be plundered before being fired when daylight broke number of european must be seen at edge of water in harbour boat be at once lowered crew armed to teeth rowed ashore here found about hundred european many of wounded when rioting have broken out have a arranged assembled at anglo egyptian bank be taken off to merchant steamer lying behind fleet information confirmed worst foreboding of fugitive there when first gun of bombardment be fired gregory have gone up with other employee to top of house where commanded view over whole scene of action after first few minute firing must see little for battery ship be alike shrouded in smoke at first there have be feeling of insecurity doubt whether shot too highly aimed might not come into town order to abstain carefully from injuring city have be well observed except to palace few house close to water edge damage be done towards evening who have resolved to remain behind gathered at anglo egyptian bank at mr ferguson consultation be held later be agreed that next morning must go to bank be far more massive building with fewer entrance greater facility for defence when town be quiet therefore be employed in transferring valuable good there house be then locked up left to fate against mere rising of rabble latter might have be successfully defended there be little doubt that before leaving town troop must join fanatic in case house not built with special eye for defence must hardly hope to hold out against persistent attack bank however might hope to make stout defence be built of massive stone lower window be barred strong barricade be built against massive door hundred twenty resolute men well armed must hold against even persistent attack if unsupported by artillery early in afternoon felt that critical moment have approached throughout night fire have raged from opposite side of great square where several deserted house have be broken into plundered by mob soldier stationed in square have prevented further disorder now however party of troop from fort began to pour in be already known that loss have be very heavy many of fort have be destroyed soon broke up joining mob commenced work of pillage door be blown in shutter torn off with wild yell shout native population poured in work of destruction have begun garrison of bank saw many european hurrying too late to reach that shelter murdered before eye in levantine quarter cracking of pistol shout of men showed that work of massacre be proceeding there soon door of house in great square be forced in ere long great number of men loaded with spoil of kind staggered out so far bank have be left alone be now turn mob poured down upon a came up sharp fire broke out from window answered by discharge of musket pistol from crowd here men fell fast have be worked up to pitch of excitement fanaticism that gap be more than filled by fresh comer afternoon evening fight continued in vain mob endeavoured to break down massive iron bar of window batter in door although many of defender be wounded several killed by fire from window of neighbouring house from road steady fire at point most hotly attacked drove assailant back again again at twelve o'clock assault slackened soldier have long left so far a must be seen from roof of house have entirely evacuated town a fact became known to mob thought of consequence of action cooled fury for knew that probably troop must land from british ship next day man have plunder to secure gradually crowd melted away by two o'clock be quiet although occasionally fresh fire burst out in various quarter of town there must be little doubt that great bulk of population have followed example of army have left city then besieged gathered in great office on ground floor a be agreed that there must be probably renewal of attack quietly left house locking door after made way down to shore believed that be only survivor when reached end of town found that building of credit lyonnais have also be successfully defended though ottoman bank have be overpowered within upwards of hundred in number killed gregory have done full share in defence received musket ball in shoulder wife have passed terrible time while conflagration be raging be evident that populace have risen be undoubtedly murdering a well a burning plundering delight be indeed great when saw husband with others approaching in man of war boat fact that one arm be in sling be scarcely noticed in joy at return alive thank god be safe said a came up gangway have be awful time have almost given up hope of ever seeing alive again told dear that felt confident must beat off scum of town of course be sharp fight there be never real danger of breaking in only lost about dozen out of nearly hundred twenty twenty of be wounded injury be not at serious will soon be all right again be only broken collarbone however have be terrible time great square almost european quarter have be entirely destroyed destruction of property be something frightful most of merchant will be absolutely ruined fortunately firm be insured pretty well up to full value thought that must not break in there moved out evening before to anglo egyptian bank town be full of troop doubted whether must hold place a bank be much stronger agreed that be better to join two garrison fight out there be very glad did so for doubt whether must have defended place successfully mr ferguson clerk have come off with gregory to simoon on board there be plenty of accommodation for a be not one of ship have be taken up for accommodation of fugitive among party who came on board be doctor who have taken part in defence of bank have attended to wounded a fight went on did so again that evening told gregory that in month must if took care of be able to use arm again next morning there be consultation in cabin mr ferguson have gone on shore late previous afternoon a five hundred sailor have be landed have returned in evening be certain said that nothing can be done until place be rebuilt sailor be busy at work fighting fire there be continued fresh outbreak bulk of native have left arabi before marching out opened prison released convict scum of town be still there continue destruction whenever get chance score two have be caught red handed shot down number of others have be flogged batch of sailor will land morning order will soon be restored unless arabi who be encamped with ten thousand men two mile outside town make effort to recover place think be likely to do so for now that european house have be destroyed there must be no longer reluctance to bombard town even if arabi did recover must very soon be shelled out by way larger number of people have be saved than be imagined several of street in poor european quarter have escaped people barricaded end fought so desperately that assailant drew off finding easier to plunder better quarter even if mob have overcome resistance of defender of lane must have found little worth taking there so five hundred european have escaped will be very useful charley beresford have charge of police arrangement on shore have gang of at work fighting fire native be forced to assist wire will be restored in day two when will of course telegraph for instruction have doubt that mr partridge will send out order to rebuild a soon a order be completely restored imagine that most of will be recalled home until be done even if place be intact business must be done a good must be of little use to navy army for doubt army will be sent arabi be a powerful a ever now that have taken matter in hand must be carried through at rate there will be clerk work to be done here plan for new building will naturally be prepared at home foreman of work sent out be bad job for a be must not complain for have escaped with life hope that in six month may open again however can form plan until receive instruction from home gregory did not go ashore for next week by time order have be completely restored fire extinguished street made at least passable sailor have be aided by battalion of marine have be telegraphed for from malta by admiral before bombardment began khedive have returned to

naval officer in command landed one hundred twenty five men to assist blue jacket two day later th regiment battalion of th rifle arrived shop in street escaped destruction gradually reopened country people began to bring in supply many of refugee on board ship sailed for home while who found house still standing although everything in be smashed destroyed set to work to make habitable soon temporary shed be erected such portion of cargo on board merchantman a must be likely to find sale be landed before end of week mr ferguson have received answer to telegram three day previously have received wire have written fully letter came via marseille after congratulation at escape of staff mr partridge wrote a say that house warehouse be entirely destroyed with content there can be nothing for clerk to do have best return at once to england will make best arrangement can for a have plan of ground have already instructed architect to prepare sketch for rebuilding on larger scale than before insurance company be sending out agent to verify claim looking at last report seems to that loss of good a well a of building will be fully covered must of staff determine to remain in alexandria to take chance of finding something to do be authorized to pay three month salary to promise to reinstate a soon a reopen anticipate further disturbance strong force be being sent out there can be doubt that arabi will be crushed a soon a be ready to take field other direction followed be only amplification of mentioned what do think annie gregory said when ferguson have read to staff portion of letter concerned will take three month pay remain here will go back to england what do think there be two light in to look at annie first must be best for secondly will like best of course first be more difficult point to decide see partridge doe say that will be kept on only say that will do best for think that there be chance of keeping on at full pay if intended to do so must have be cheaper for to give pay here in case must save passage back to england out again think must not reckon on getting anything like full pay while be in england know have lost faith in literary power think have improved certainly must not like after last experience to trust to for keeping in question be what must do here there will be plenty of opening for men who can speak native language a labour overseer contractor for food for army will want men of sort a know several of through work in port being in partridge house have doubt must get employment way carry on very well till trade be open again obtain then good deal better berth than must offer doubt one must get employment in transport commissariat of army when come out will be thing to think seriously of objection to be personal one in first place must lead to nothing when affair be over in second place must be certain to meet men knew at harrow at university since then own must shrink from a gregory hilliard mind carrying parcel helping to load dray must not like a gregory hartley to be known to be doing sort of thing personally feel not smallest humiliation in doing so think must be fair to geoffrey must not like if be earl for fellow who knew to be able to say that brother be knocking about in egypt a interpreter mule driver something of sort that certainly have to be taken into consideration be not likely must get sort of berth that officer must be appointed to for officer in army whose regiment be not coming out here will be rushing to war office to apply for sort of appointment must enable to come out to war again be almost certain that when business be over suppose will last long after get army out here fresh egyptian force will be raised may be sure that greater portion of troop will be hurried back a soon a be over that a present egyptian army will be altogether smashed up will be absolutely necessary that there must be force of kind other can put stop to mahdi fellow doings have overrun soudan inflicted serious defeat on egyptian troop there have captured considerable portion of kordofan of course be owing to insurrection that row have occurred down at red sea where men have be fighting be likely enough that may appoint british officer to new force might get fair position on will want interpreter there promotion will be sure to be rapid might have opportunity of distinguishing get appointment where must without discrediting take own name again be only among thing might be at worst be certain to get sort of post at alexandria must enable to live without trenching upon three month pay be offered then if must see nothing better must return to partridge employment when reopen here have doubt that must improve position think that parrott be likely to come back again climate did not suit be always having attack of fever ferguson have know for told so reported very favourably about work to headquarters a have be wounded in defence of house have additional claim others will of course be moved up must get junior clerkship advance in way of remuneration great improvement in position so think have better accept three month pay take chance at rate there will be fear of disturbance at mob have have lesson here that be not likely to forget must fancy that although may withdraw army two three regiment will be left here at cairo for long time to come must be fool indeed if threw away money that business will cost before be over let egypt slip altogether out of finger again france have forfeited right to have anything to say in matter in hand will be very valuable possession certainly stay here must be of inestimable advantage to native a must govern egypt a govern india do away with tyranny oppression extortion of native official mr hilliard quite agreed with husband accordingly next day gregory informed mr ferguson that must accept three month pay discharge must at rate for time remain in alexandria think be right hilliard there will be lot of opportunity here for man who know language a do if like will speak to mr ross saw yesterday in town said that two of assistant have be killed have already obtained fresh contract very heavy one for supply of meat for troop a arrive have doubt must be very glad to engage on good term though engagement must only be made during stay of army here thank sir will be much obliged to if will do so must rather that engagement must be temporary one on side so must be free to leave at few day notice contractor after chat with gregory hilliard be glad to secure service saw advantage that must be to have gentleman to represent with army instead of agent of very different kind other men must do to purchase animal from arab to receive at port when be brought over from spain italy required variety of quality difficult to obtain in same person to act a agent with army gregory be exactly man required be soon on excellent term with officer of quartermaster department contractor who brought in cargo of cattle a soon a bulk of army sailed from alexandria to ismailia made latter town headquarters by power of work tact good temper smoothed away difficulty so often arise between contractor army official won goodwill of with whom came in contact when army removed to cairo after defeat dispersal of arabi force at tel el kebir gregory established there be joined by wife child a soon a matter settled down considerable portion of troop have left egypt mr ross said to of course operation in future will be comparatively small mr hilliard must reduce staff quite understand that gregory replied knew must have to look out for something else will be very sorry to lose service have indeed be invaluable be sure have be appreciated by army men a much a by certainly must not think of leaving until get berth be only because see opening if like to take might lead to something better in future than anything can offer know that colonel hick arrived here fortnight since be to take command of egyptian army to have rank of pasha several officer have received appointment on staff will shortly be going up to khartoum be speaking to yesterday a be doing so two of officer of wolseley staff came in question of supply came up mentioned name said that thought that be very man for that be master of arabic excellent organizer very important matter where there be so few english officer together gentleman one of officer who knew work that have done at once confirmed what have said declared that wolseley quartermaster general must speak a warmly in favour hick told that until got up to khartoum must not say what arrangement must be made for supply that must at rate be very glad to have with in capacity of first class interpreter for general service with staff with temporary rank of captain with special view of service in organizing supply train when moved forward said must speak to ascertain view be very much obliged to indeed must take twenty four hour to think over of course will be guided to extent by question whether appointment must be likely to be permanent one have doubt indeed hick said a much asked question replied ' can hardly make permanent appointment now a be not quite in saddle have doubt from what say that mr hilliard will make valuable officer after first campaign will without difficulty be able to obtain permanent appointment in egyptian army thank most heartily mr ross seems to grand opening there be doubt that a troop leave egyptian army will be thoroughly reorganized there will be many opening for man who know language be ready to work hard doubt regiment will be largely officered by englishman that evening gregory have long talk with wife like thought of leaving even for time doubt when mahdi be settled with will be able to join at khartoum believe be by mean unpleasant place to live in of course will come down take up be splendid chance will really be reinstatement once holding commission in egyptian army must resume own name have future to look forward to entering service a army be being reorganized must have great pull must be sure to get on be able to write to father brother without appearing that wanted help of kind there be tear in mr hilliard eye said bravely quite agree with gregory of course will be sorry that must leave even for time seems to too that be grand opportunity know what pain be to time that be at alexandria that must be working in such subordinate position now there be opening by will be in position ere long more worthy of birth education have doubt will get on very well here believe that hick pasha have brought wife out with here of officer will doubt be married men also a wife of one of officer will of course get to know must be selfish indeed to say word to keep back will be delighted to think of associating with other english gentleman a one of so be settled next day gregory called on hick pasha latter have made more enquiry respecting be well pleased with appearance have already gentleman named a staff interpreter mr hilliard can appoint at once interpreter to quartermaster department attached to personal staff for present can tell that egyptian army will be largely increased will be able after time to procure better appointment when have once defeated mahdi restored order there will be many appointment open for reorganization of soudan there be good many preparation to be made before leave expect to do in course of three four week will be glad of assistance a soon a can join will be glad to do so at once mr ross have kindly told that be at liberty to resign post under a soon a like very well then may consider appointed today intention be to go first to suakim thence up to berber so by water to khartoum next three week passed rapidly gregory be on following day introduced to various officer of hick pasha staff on learning that be married general asked wife to dinner to make acquaintance of lady hick wife of three of fellow officer at last time came for parting annie bore up well although when alone have many cry be always cheerful went with husband saw off at station of railway for ismailia without breaking down badly chapter terrible disaster be anxious time for wife after gregory started with have left with feeling of confidence that insurrection must speedily be put down garrison of khartoum have inflicted several severe defeat upon mahdi have also suffered revers however be only to be expected when troop under be scarcely more disciplined than of dervish who have always be greatly superior in number inspired with fanatical belief in prophet with british officer to command british officer to drill discipline troop there must be fear of recurrence of disaster before started mr hilliard have become intimate with wife of hick pasha of other married officer have paid visit with to harem of high turkish official visit be frequently exchanged what with care of boy time be constantly occupied received letter from gregory a frequently a possible after arrival at omdurman until set out with main body under general on way to el obeid before starting said hoped that in two month campaign must be over el obeid recovered mahdi smashed up that a soon a returned to khartoum hick pasha must send for wife daughter other married officer for wife of course must accompany can not say much for omdurman wrote khartoum be nice place many of house there have shady garden hick have promised to recommend for majority in one of turkish regiment in interval of own work have got up drill will of course tell then what real name be so that can be gazetted in be likely enough even after defeat mahdi war may go on for time before be stamped out in year may be full blown colonel if only egyptian one a pay of english officer be good will be able to have very comfortable home for need not repeat instruction darling a to what must do in event improbable a be of disaster when absolutely assured of death not until then will go back to england with boy see father be not man to change mind unless be to humble before think must do right thing for if will not there be letter for geoffrey have settled income at present when come into title will feel quite certain make allowance know that must for shrink from doing for boy sake will not hesitate to carry out instruction must say have better write to father for interview might be unpleasant one if have to appeal to geoffrey have better call upon show letter feel sure that will do what can gregory month later messenger came up from suakim with despatch dated october rd force be then within few day march of el obeid news be not altogether cheering horde of enemy hovered about rear communication be already difficult have to depend upon store carried cut off altogether from base brought private letter from officer among one for mr hilliard be short written in pencil in few day dear decisive battle will take place although will be tough fight none of have fear of result in very improbable event of defeat will if have time slip on arab dress have with may hope to escape however have little fear that will come to god bless protect boy gregory month passed away news came from hick pasha of officer then there be rumour current in bazaar of disaster one morning when annie called upon lady hick found several of lady there with pale anxious face paused at door be alarmed mr hilliard lady hick said nizim pasha have be here morning thought that might have heard rumour be current in bazaar that there have be disaster say there be confirmation whatever of report doe not deny however that have caused anxiety among authority for sometimes rumour whose origin one know do turn out to be correct said that enquiry have be made foundation for story can be got at questioned closely say that can only account for on ground that if victory have be won official account from government must have be here before that be solely on account that rumour have got about said there be reason for supposing that silence meant disaster complete victory might have be won yet messenger with despatch might have be captured killed by party of tribesman hanging behind army wandering about country between army khartoum still of course be making very anxious party soon broke up none having reassuring suggestion to offer annie returned to lodging to weep over boy pray for safety of father day week passed still word came to cairo at khartoum there be ferment among native population secret be made of fact that tribesman who came went declared that hick pasha army be utterly destroyed at length egyptian government announced to wife of officer that pension must be given to according to rank of husband a captain interpreter gregory wife have small one be sufficient for to live upon one by one other lady gave up hope returned to england annie stayed on misfortune might have befallen army gregory might have escaped in disguise have like other lady put on mourning for for have declared belief that might still be alive must not have applied for pension be necessary for child sake of one thing be determined must not go with a beggar to father who have cast gregory off until a have said received absolute news of death be not in want a pension be small one felt that must be well for to be employed asked lady hick before left to mention at house of egyptian lady to whom went to say goodbye mr hilliard must be glad to give lesson in english french music idea pleased obtained several pupil of be lady lesson generally consisted in sitting for hour with two three time week talking to conversation being in short sentence of gave english translation repeated over over again until knew by heart caused great amusement be accompanied by much laughter on part of lady attendant several of pupil however be young boy girl teaching here be of more serious kind lesson to boy be given first thing in morning pupil be brought to house by attendant at eleven o'clock taught girl returned at one have two hour more teaching in afternoon must have obtained more pupil have wished to pay received added to income enabled to live very comfortably to save up money have negro servant who be very fond of boy must leave in charge with perfect confidence while be teaching in latter part of ventured to hope that news might yet come to for british expedition have started for relief of general gordon who have gone up early in year to khartoum where be hoped that influence have gained among native at time be in command of egyptian force in soudan must enable to make head against insurrection arrival have be hailed by population be soon evident to that unless aided by england with something more than word khartoum must finally fall request for aid be slighted have asked that two regiment must be sent from suakim to keep open route to berber mr gladstone government refused even slight assistance to man have sent out be not until may that public indignation at base desertion of one of noblest spirit britain ever produced caused preparation for rescue to be made be december before leading regiment arrived at korti far up nile after fighting two hard battle force have marched across loop of nile came down upon above metemmeh party started up river at once in two steamer gordon have sent down to meet only arrived near town to hear that be too late that khartoum have fallen that gordon have be murdered army be at once hurried back to coast leaving to mahdist more triumphant than ever to occupy dongola to push down possibly a be confident must do to capture egypt news of failure be terrible blow to mr hilliard have hoped that when khartoum be relieved information at least might be obtained from prisoner a to fate of british officer at el obeid that most of have be killed be certain still clung to hope that husband might have escaped from general massacre thanks to knowledge of language disguise have with even that if captured later on might be prisoner that might have escaped detection altogether be still living among friendly tribesman be heavy blow to therefore when heard that troop be being hurried down to coast that mahdi must be uncontested master of egypt a far a assouan did however receive news when force returned to cairo although depressing did not extinguish hope lieutenant colonel colborne by good luck have ascertained that native boy in service of general buller claimed to have be at el obeid upon questioning closely found out that have unquestionably be there for described accurately position colonel colborne who have started with hick pasha have be forced by illness to return have occupied in one of engagement boy be then slave of egyptian officer of expedition army have suffered much from want of water have

be necessary to get to water be misled by guide at noon arab burst down upon square in force be marching be broken terrible slaughter took place then hick pasha with officer seeing that be lost gathered together kept enemy at bay with revolver till ammunition be exhausted after fought with sword till be killed hick pasha being last to fall lad hid among dead be not discovered until next morning when be made slave by man who found be terrible there be still hope if boy have concealed among dead husband might have done same not being combatant officer might not have be near others when affair took place moreover lad have said that black regiment in rear of square have kept together marched away believed have be afterwards killed did not know if gregory have be there when square be broken might well have kept with at slipped on disguise made escape be at least possible must not give up hope so year went on thing be quiet in egypt native army have be raised there under command of

year afterwards have be given freedom being now past fifty have taken service with gregory hilliard wife vocabulary be large one be acquainted with most of dialect of soudan tribe from time when husband be first missing mr hilliard cherished idea that day child might grow up search for father perhaps ascertain fate beyond doubt be very conscientious woman be resolved that at pain to herself must when once certain of husband death go to england obtain recognition of boy by family be pleasant to think that day be far distant when must give up hope saw too that if soudan be ever reconquered knowledge of tribal language must be of immense benefit to son therefore insisted from first that woman must always talk to in one other of language that knew thus gregory almost unconsciously acquired several of dialect used in soudan arabic formed basis of except negro tongue at first mixed up a grew mr hilliard insisted that nurse must speak one for month then use so that by time be twelve year old boy must speak in negro tongue dozen dialect with equal facility mother have year before engaged teacher of arabic for learned readily a be root of egyptian other language have picked

developing figure for giving good carriage a well a activity alertness arranged with frenchman who have served in army have gained prize a swordsman in regiment to give boy lesson two morning in week thus at fifteen gregory be well grown athletic have much of bearing appearance of english public school boy mother have be very particular in seeing that manner be of englishman hope time will come when will associate with english gentleman must wish in respect to be like belong to good family must by chance day go home must do credit to dear father boy have for year be acquainted with family story except that did not know name bore be father christian name not that of family grandfather must have be very bad man mother to have quarreled with father for marrying well boy hardly understand extent of exclusiveness of englishman of course be not always so to people idea of son daughter marrying into family of le rank than appears to be almost terrible thing a have told although daughter of clergyman be when became orphan obliged to go out a governess there be harm in mother harm dear certain loss of position have father be alive have be living with in country rectory grandfather might not have be pleased at father falling in love with because must probably have considered being a know by photograph fine tall handsome man having best education money must give might have married very much better be to say heiress of property into family of influence through might have be pushed on must not have thought of opposing marriage on ground of family governess be different thing be in many case lady in respect position be doubtful one in family be treated a one of in others position be very little different from of upper servant grandfather be passionate man very proud man father elder brother be well provided for there be two sister father hoped must make good marriage lived in very good style uncle be extravagant grandfather be over indulgent crippled good deal in paying debt that incurred be natural therefore that must have objected to father engagement to what called penniless governess be only what be to be expected if have stated objection to marriage calmly there need have be quarrel father must assuredly have married in case grandfather might have refused to assist if did so there need have be breakup in family such a took place however a be father resented tone have be merely difference of opinion became serious quarrel never saw other afterwards be great grief to be owing to being unable to earn living in england that father brought out here believe must have done well at home though must have be hard struggle at time be very delicate be ordered by doctor to go to warm climate therefore father accepted position of kind at least enabled to live obtained for benefit of warm climate then chance came of going up to soudan there be certainty if expedition succeeded a everyone believed must must have obtained permanent rank in egyptian army so recovered position in life that have voluntarily given up for sake be illness have be affection of lung dear be constant cough threatened to turn to consumption be one of most fatal disease have in england have cured mother for often hear coughing at night yes cough have be little troublesome of late gregory indeed from time of disaster to expedition of hick pasha annie hilliard have lost ground be conscious of except for sake of boy have not troubled over have not altogether given up hope hope grew fainter fainter a year went on have not be for promise to husband not to mention real name to make application to father unless absolutely assured of death must for gregory sake have written to mr hartley asked for help must have enabled to take boy home to england have properly educated there have implicit faith in binding of promise so made a long a be not driven by absolute want to apply to mr hartley be determined to keep to year after conversation gregory be sixteen now tall strong have for time past be anxious to obtain employment must enable mother to give up teaching of indeed have be obliged to relinquish during past few month cheek have become hollow cough be now frequent by day a well a by night have consulted english doctor who saw by paper be staying at shepherd hotel have hesitated before giving direct opinion on imploring to tell exact state of health said gently be afraid madam can give hope of recovery one lung have already gone other be very seriously diseased be living in england must say that life might be prolonged by taking to warm climate a be change must be made for better thank doctor wanted to know exact truth be able to make arrangement accordingly be quite convinced that condition be hopeless thought right to consult physician to know how much time must reckon on can tell that be always difficult mr hilliard may be three month hence might be more speedily vessel might give way in lung suddenly on other hand might live six month of course can not say how rapid progress of disease have be may not be week doctor be not at afraid of hearing sentence indeed can see in eye may be within week doctor bowed head gravely may be at time thank said quietly be sure must not be long have be teaching three week ago have to give up last pupil breath be so short that slightest exertion brings on fit of coughing on return home said to gregory dear boy must have seen can not have helped seeing that time be not long here have seen english doctor today say end may come at moment oh mother mother lad cried throwing on knee burying face in lap say so news indeed did not come a surprise to have for month noticed steady change in how face have fallen away how hand seemed nerveless flesh transparent eye grew larger larger many time have walked far up among hill when beyond reach of human eye thrown down cried unrestrainedly until strength seemed utterly exhausted yet verdict now given seemed to come a sudden blow must not break down dear said quietly for month have felt that be so for sake did not care to live thank god have be spared to see growing up must wish though must have liked to see fairly started in life feel that may now make way unaided now want before be too late to give instruction in desk will find sealed envelope contains copy of register of marriage of birth will prove that father married have son can get plenty of witness who can prove that be child mentioned promised father must not mention real name to anyone until be necessary for to write to grandfather have kept that promise name be gregory hilliard so have not taken false name be christian name third name family name will find when open that envelope have be thinking for month past what have best do be advice look upon a order be old enough to think for know that sir herbert kitchener sirdar be pushing way up nile have doubt that with knowledge of arabic of language used by black race in soudan will be able to obtain sort of post in army perhaps a interpreter to one of officer commanding brigade same position in fact a father have except that army be now virtually british whereas that went with be egyptian have two reason for desiring wish to go home until be in position to dispense with aid from family have done without trust that will be able to do same must like to be able to go home at one twenty to say to grandfather ' have not come home to ask for money assistance of kind be earning living honourably only ask recognition by family a father son ' be probable that expedition will last fully two year must be gradual advance even then if khalifa be beaten must be considerable time before matter be thoroughly settled there will be many civil post open to who like be well acquainted with language of country if can obtain one of may well remain there until come of age can then obtain few month leave of absence go to england second reason be that although hope that father be still alive have almost died out be just possible that be like neufeld others prisoner in khalifa hand possibly living a arab cultivator near el obeid many prisoner will be taken from of may learn such detail of battle a may clear of darkness hang over father fate when do go home gregory have best go first to father brother address be on paper in envelope be heir to peerage have perhaps now come into have reason for supposing that sided with father against yours brother be not bad friend although saw little of other for father after left oxford be for most part away from england until year before marriage at time uncle be in america having gone out with two three others on hunting expedition among rocky mountain there be therefore reason for supposing that will receive otherwise than kindly when once be sure that be nephew may indeed for aught know have made effort to discover father after returned from abroad must rather leave alone altogether mother gregory said passionately that can not do boy father be anxious that must be at least recognized afterwards bear proper name will not be going a beggar there will be nothing humiliating a to grandfather may not even be alive be seldom that see english newspaper even have death be advertised in one of paper must hardly have noticed a never did more than just glance at principal item of news in desk will also see bank book be in name have thought better that must stand so a will save great deal of trouble must anything happen to happily have never have reason to draw upon there be now about five hundred fifty pound standing to credit of late have generally paid in money be personally known to manager must there be difficulty have made will leaving everything to that sum will keep if can not obtain employment speak of until come of age will at rate facilitate getting employment with army a will not be obliged to demand much pay can take anything that offer reason for going to england be that grandfather may if be dead have relented at last towards father may have left share in fortune although might well refuse to accept help from if be alive can have hesitation in taking that must be yours by right think sometimes now boy have be wrong in not accepting fact of father death a proved taking home to england will believe that acted for best shrank from thought of going home a beggar

dust in tightly fitting handbag have ample supply of food for three day along opening of have pasted strip of paper will do very well for first meal hilliard will be of good afterwards have prepared for gregory said have bought gum bottle a have newspaper in pocket can seal up after meal by jove be good idea one never thought of gum will be quite sufficient for up to assouan have two more bottle in box must be sufficient to last for long time when be in desert a wo take minute to put fresh paper on after meal will have satisfaction of eating food without being mixed with dust there be general chorus of approval declared that must search shop in assouan endeavour to find gum paste will do a well ewart said a can always get flour will be able to defy dust fiend a far a food go certainly did not expect that old campaigner must learn lesson from hilliard a soon a started be just idea occurred to gregory said gum bottle be handed round although nothing must be done for who have brought provision in hamper three of who have like gregory put food in bag be able to seal up tightly be now may heat be becoming intolerable especially a window be closed to keep out dust in spite of however found way in settled everywhere clothes hair became white with worked way down neck where perspiration changed into mud covered face a if with cake of flour at first gregory attempted to brush off clothes a settled upon soon found that there be advantage in so sat quietly in corner like rest looked like dirty white statue there be occasional stop when got out shook took few mouthful of fresh air gregory plan for keeping out dust from food turned out great success meal be eaten in open air during stoppage on arriving at assouan went to transport department to get pass for journey up nile a far a wady halfa next step be to go down to river for swim by dint of shaking beating to get rid of accumulated dust assouan be not pleasant place to linger in a soon a have completed purchase captain

number of other officer newcomer from england others men who have be down to cairo to recruit belonged to branch of service included dozen of medical staff three of transport corp gunner engineer cavalry infantry barge be deep in water with cargo of store of kind rail sleeper for railway steamer be also deeply loaded passage be delightful one to gregory everything be new to cheery talk joke of officer graver discussion of work before calculation a to time distance story told of what have taken place during previous campaign by who shared in be so different from anything have ever before experienced that hour passed almost unnoticed be glorious to think that in humble capacity be yet one of band who be on way up to meet horde of khalifa to rescue soudan from tyranny under have groaned to avenge gordon hick gallant men who have died with occasionally captain ewart came up talked to be well content to sit on one of bale listen to conversation without joining in in couple of year too must have have experience must be able to take part at present preferred to be listener distance to wady halfa be three hundred mile current be strong steamer must not tow boat more than five mile hour against be sixty hour from start before arrived gregory be astonished at stir life in place great number of native labourer be at work unloading barge native craft line of railway ran down to wharf where work of loading truck went on briskly smoke pouring out from many chimney clang of hammer told that railway engineering work be in full swing vast pile of box case bale be accumulated on wharf showed that there must be loss of time in pushing forward supply to abu hamed a soon a railway be completed to point wady halfa have be starting point of railway commenced year before few mile have be constructed several building erected for functionary military civil gordon when governor of soudan have refused to allow province to be saddled with expense of construction to undertake responsibility of carrying out in there be renewal of work have gordon be rescued khartoum permanently occupied line must no doubt have be carried on with retirement of british troop work ceased great store of material have be gathered there remained for year half covered with sand in other climate must have be destructive in dry air of upper egypt remained almost uninjured proved very useful when work be again taken up be wonderful undertaking for along two hundred thirty four mile of desert food water necessary have to be carried together with material for construction not only have army of workman to be fed body of troop to guard for abu hamed at other end of line for be making be occupied by large body of dervish who might at moment swoop down across plain have sirdar have resource of england at back work must have be easier for must have ordered from home new engine plant of description be egyptian work have to be done in cheapest possible way old engine have to be patched up makeshift of kind employed fortunately have in chief engineer of line man whose energy determination resource be equal to own major girouard be young officer of royal engineer like white officer in egyptian service held rank of major be canadian by birth proved in respect equal to onerous responsible work to be appointed however labour be cheap railway battalion be raised among egyptian peasant pay being same a of soldier strong hearty accustomed to labour scanty diet men must have be more fitted for work preferred to soldiering for although a have already shown be still further to prove egyptian can fight fight bravely be by nature peaceable prefers work however hard in addition to battalion native of country of soudan fugitive from ruined village desolated plain be largely employed line have now be carried three quarter of distance to abu hamed be still in hand of dervish have be constructed with extraordinary rapidity for ground be so level that only occasional cutting be needed organization of labour be perfect men be divided into gang under head man having own special work to do there be men who unloaded truck labourer who did earth work more skilled hand who levelled a fast a truck be emptied gang of men carried sleeper forward laid down roughly in position others followed corrected distance between rail be then brought along laid down with fish plate in proper place men put on boy screwed up nut then plate layer followed lined rail accurately when be done sand be thrown in packed down between sleeper by division of labour line be pushed on from one to two mile day camp moving forward with line six tank truck brought up water for use of labourer daily everything worked with a much regularity a in great factory at home troop of friendly tribesman in pay scoured country watched well along road farther to east so a to prevent band of dervish from dashing suddenly down upon worker at wady halfa captain ewart two three other officer left steamer to proceed up line gregory be very sorry to lose can not tell captain ewart said how deeply grateful feel to for immense kindness have shown know what must have done have be left without advice assistance in getting outfit making arrangement to come up here dear lad latter said say anything more in case must naturally be glad to do what must for son of man who died fighting in same cause a be now engaged in in case have be pleasure for be sure will do credit to to mother who have taken such pain in preparing for work be going to do in fitting for position that now occupy a officer who have come up with in train from cairo be going on have be told by ewart something of gregory story have aided that officer in making gregory feel at home in new circumstance in two day have be on board boat have made acquaintance of several others river railway have now be carried from wady halfa to kerma above third cataract heavy store be towed up by steamer native craft most of engine truck have be transferred to desert line few be still retained to carry up troop if necessary aid craft in accumulating store one of train started few hour after arrival of steamer at wady halfa gregory with officer going up occupied two horse box several of have be engaged in last campaign pointed out place of interest at sarras thirty mile up road there have be fight on th of april when dervish host advancing strong in belief that must carry before down to sea be defeated by egyptian force under sirdar general chermside next stop of train be at akasheh have be very important station before last advance a store have be accumulated here when army advanced here have be strongly entrenched camp for dervish be in force fifteen mile away at ferket be busy time have here said one of officer who have taken part in expedition fortnight before have idea that early move be contemplated indeed be only on th of march that excitement began that day kitchener received telegram ordering immediate advance on dongola have expected must take place soon there be doubt that sudden order be result of arrangement on part of government with italy that must relieve from pressure of dervish round kassala by effecting diversion obliging enemy to send large force down to dongola to resist advance be busy time sirdar came up to wady halfa egyptian troop be divided between place sarras akasheh th soudanese be marched up from suakim did distance to nile one hundred twenty mile in four day be something like marching well saw wady halfa for month place be quite a busy now glory be gone two three hut for railway men shelter for company of egyptian represent whole camp a neared ferket officer said there be sharp fight out there on desert large body of dervish advanced from ferket be seen to leave by cavalry patrol a soon a patrol reached camp available horse two hundred forty in number started under major murdoch four mile out came in sight of three hundred mounted dervish with thousand spearmen on foot ground be rough unfavourable for cavalry charge so cavalry retired to valley between two hill in order to get better ground while be doing so however dervish charged down upon murdoch rode at at once there be hand to hand fight lasted for twenty minute then enemy turned galloped off to shelter of spearmen trooper dismounted opened fire on regiment of soudanese coming up enemy drew off eighteen of dervish be killed eighty wounded loss be very slight fight be most satisfactory one for showed that egyptian cavalry have now sufficient confidence in to face baggara headquarters came up to akasheh on st of june spy have kept intelligence department well informed a to state of thing at ferket be known that three thousand troop be there led by fifty seven emir ground be carefully reconnoitred preparation made for attack be certain that dervish also have spy among camel driver camp follower sirdar kept intention secret on evening of june th be not known to save three four of principal officer that intended to attack on following morning be because be anxious to effect complete surprise that did not even bring up north staffordshires there be two road to ferket one by river other through desert river column be strongest consisted of infantry division with two field battery two maxim total strength of desert column consisting of cavalry brigade camel corp regiment of infantry battery of horse artillery two maxim in two thousand one hundred men be to make detour come down upon nile to south of ferket thereby cutting off retreat of enemy carrying two day ration troop started late in afternoon of th halted at nine in evening three mile from ferket at half past two moved forward again marching quietly silently at half past four deployed into line close to enemy position few minute later alarm be given dervish leaping to arm discovered formidable force in front of at same time found that retreat be cut off by large body of troop in rear while on opposite bank of river be force of arab ally though must have seen that position be hopeless dervish showed sign of fear fought with desperation of rat in trap egyptian advanced with steady volley baggara horseman attacked furiously be repulsed with heavy loss there be hand to hand fighting among hut second brigade carried with bayonet rough hill that see over there be over by seven o'clock loss be only twenty killed eighty wounded about one thousand of dervish be killed including chief emir forty of others while five hundred be taken prisoner be great victory very important one can hardly be said that be glorious a outnumbered by three to one still be heavy blow to dervish fact that khalifa be obliged to send troop down to nile to check advance have proved so formidable must have greatly relieved pressure on italian at kassala there be pause here be certain that must have to meet much stronger force before got to dongola well a egyptian troop have fought be thought advisable to give stronger backing heat be now tremendous cholera have broken out moved to koshyeh there encamped only change have be terrific storm almost washed away in middle of august managed to get gunboat up through cataract be in hope of advancing when storm carried away twenty mile of railway by time have come up a far a cataract at ginnis twenty mile from ferket passed ground where on st of december on retirement of general wolseley expedition general grenfel stevenson with force of egyptian troop three british regiment encountered dervish army khalifa have despatched under emir nejumi defeated be notable a being first battle in newly raised egyptian army met mahdist showed that trained disciplined by british officer egyptian fellah be capable of standing against dervish of desert from point railway left nile for thirty mile crossed desert twenty mile reached fareeg be here officer said that north staffordshires came up joined egyptian dervish have fallen back before advanced after halt at sadeah sha' see a railway cut across to abu fetmeh bivouacked five mile from camp turned out at three next morning order be passed by mouth got off a silently a army of ghost will never forget disgust when small cavalry force sent on ahead to reconnoitre reported that dervish have abandoned place during night have crossed river in native boat be very clever move at rate on part of fellow who did not want to fight there be facing with whole infantry cavalry useless have nothing available to damage enemy except artillery gunboat opened fire dervish replied heavily have earthwork boat kept on pluckily till got to narrow point in stream when couple of gun have hitherto be hidden opened upon at close range while strong force of dervish infantry poured in such hot fire that boat have to fall back after field gun have peppered enemy for bit gunboat tried again fire be too hot for leading boat have to retire thing did not look very bright till nine o'clock when found that at one point river be fordable to small island opposite enemy line four battery maxim at once moved over with two company of soudanese opened fire distance across be six hundred yard fire be tremendous shell shrapnel rocket while soudanese fired volley maxim maintained shower of bullet seemed that nothing must stand against dervish stuck to gun with great pluck however fire be so far kept down that three gunboat succeeded in forcing way up passing dervish work sank steamer number of native boat dervish now began to give way gunboat steamed up river making for dongola dervish a soon a have gone reopened fire duel continued day great mass of enemy soon left also made way towards dongola be awfully annoying being obliged to remain inactive on side be especially hard for cavalry who if must have got over must have be able to cut up disperse enemy next morning dervish be gone be practically end of fighting gunboat went up shelled dongola when got there two day later dervish have have enough of of course there be little fighting be effort of party of fanatic rather than of enemy who considered resistance possible be greeted with enthusiasm by unfortunate inhabitant who have be subject to dervish tyranny a whole however have not be badly treated here have be allowed to continue to cultivate land subject only to about same taxation a have paid to egypt of course from what have done elsewhere comparative mildness of conduct of dervish be not due to feeling of mercy to policy a most advanced position with exception of scattered temporary post lower down river be necessary that there must be food for considerable body of tribesman encamped at dongola especially a army invading egypt must provide there with store for journey be therefore good policy to encourage cultivator of land to stay there thank very much gregory said when officer have concluded sketch of previous campaign of course heard that have beaten khalifa men have taken dongola paper at cairo gave detail staffordshire regiment went down directly place be taken did not yes have suffered heavily from cholera a there be now fear that egyptian soudanese must prove unequal to withstanding dervish rush there be necessity for keeping here at abu fetmeh left train embarked in steamer of party have left assouan only four five remained rest have be dropped at other station on road boat stopped few hour at dongola have for time be headquarters of advanced force great change have be made since place be captured from dervish at time population have be reduced to handful native who remained tilled enough ground for own necessity for knew that at time dervish force might come along sweep everything clear with advent of british fugitive who have scattered among village along river soon poured in number of greek trader arrived with camel good town assumed aspect of life business general established court of justice appointed authority for proper regulation of affair by time

in met death be so sir be always mother wish must when be old enough come up to soudan to make enquiry a father be good arabic scholar mother always entertained faint hope that might have escaped especially a know that good many of egyptian soldier be not killed be taken prisoner made to serve in mahdi army yes there be several of among khalifa artilleryman be very much afraid that none of officer be spared see kept together in body died fighting to last have hardly hope sir still a father be interpreter might not have be with others in other part of square be attacked that be possible

making choice selected young fellow who although evidently exerting to utmost be clearly incapable of doing share in carrying heavy bale box be easily handled by older men have pleasant face looked more intelligent than most of others to what tribe do belong gregory asked jaalin come from near metemmeh want servant seem to be strong enough for work if will be faithful do what tell will try young fellow face lit up will be faithful bey must be kind of to take be not at full strength yet although try hardest can not do a much a strong men then be abused will be very faithful if find willing to

today followed by young tribesman went to headquarters camp near empty hut be assigned to chapter gregory volunteer hut of gregory took possession be constructed of dry mud roof be of pole on be thickly laid bough palm leaf on layer of clay foot thick opening in wall eighteen inch square served a window near door floor be littered with rubbish of kind what be name zaki well zaki first thing be to clear out rubbish sweep floor a clean a can be going down to river to get baggage up can borrow shovel something of sort from one of native here if will sell buy one will pay when return will always come in useful if can not get shovel hoe will do ah have better give dollar man might not trust then walked down to river found black corporal sitting tranquilly by side of baggage man stood up saluted on gregory saying that have now house at once told off two soldier to carry thing arriving at hut found zaki hard at work shovelling rubbish through doorway just a came up boy brought down tool with crash upon little brown creature be scuttling away what be zaki be scorpion bey have killed four of be not at pleasant gregory said there may be plenty of up among bough overhead zaki nodded plenty of creature said snake then will smoke out before go in when have got rubbish out make fire in middle wet leaf thing put on will hang blanket over window shut door will moisten powder scatter among leaf sulphur will help smoke to bring down be done door closed a did not fit at tightly crack be filled with damp earth from watercourse what did pay for shovel zaki dollar bey here be other half well have better go buy thing for tomorrow will make other arrangement get fire going out here there be sauce pan kettle so can boil rice fry meat gregory then went again to officer who be acting a quartermaster have be speaking to general latter said will mess with staff dinner hour be seven o'clock be sure will soon feel at home gregory now strolled through camp troop be in little mud hut of own construction a in heat of day be much cooler than tent sun be getting low soudanese troop be occupied in cooking mending clothes sweeping street between row of hut other light duty seemed to gregory a full of fun life a party of schoolboy laughing joking playing practical trick on other physique of of regiment be splendid men averaging over six foot in height being splendidly built other regiment recruited among different tribe be not so tall sturdy figure showed to be capable of effort might be called upon to make one of officer came out of tent a passed be new arrival think sir said have so few white officer here that one spot fresh face at once yes only arrived two three hour ago name be hilliard be not attached to regiment a speak language well general hunter be going so said to make generally useful only received commission few day before leaving cairo well come in have soda whisky heat out here be frightful can tell last news from cairo when be going to move will be happy to come in have chat gregory said drink anything have be brought up in cairo be accustomed to heat find that drinking only make one more thirsty believe doe other said especially when liquid be almost a hot a one be one self will sit down on box chair be luxury that indulge in here well have heard anything about move nothing officer have spoken to seem to think that will soon begin good many came up with to wady halfa station on river heard that who have sufficiently recovered be under order to rejoin very shortly yes suppose wo be long of course know nothing here expect will till order come for to start be not time of year when one expects to be on move if do go be pretty certain that be because kitchener have made up mind for dash forward see if take abu hamed drive dervish away can at once push railway on to place a soon a be done troop can be brought up advance made to berber if not farther during cool season if can ever call cool season here be there great force at abu hamed nothing must stand against for moment chief force outside omdurman be at metemmeh under mahmud khalifa favourite son see jaalin made fool of instead of waiting until must lend hand revolted a soon a took dongola result be that mahmud came down pretty well wiped out defended stoutly at metemmeh have chance against host a brought with town be taken defender between two three thousand fighting men be massacred together with most of woman child by account brought down to by men who got away must have be even more horrible business than usual dervish be past master in art of massacre however think that course be nearly up of late good many fugitive from kordofan have arrived here say that there will be general revolt there when hear that have given dervish heavy thrashing where do think great fight be likely to take place gregory asked not side of metemmeh except at abu hamed hear of other strong dervish force between omdurman if mahmud think strong enough doubt will fight if khalifa know business will fall back with force at omdurman fight one big battle two army together will from what hear amount to sixty seventy thousand there be doubt whatever that with fault beggar can fight will be tough affair believe will have british troop here to help before final advance can depend now on soudanese egyptian to fight hard there be not enough of odds must be too heavy sirdar be not man to risk failure with couple of brigade of british infantry there can be doubt what result will be fancy that if beat in one big fight will be up with mahdism be only because poor beggar of tribesman regard dervish a invincible that have put up so long with tyranny rising of jaalin news get from kordofan show that moment hear dervish be beaten khartoum be in hand there will be general rising dervish will be pretty well exterminated hope that mahmud wo fight for if doe beat khalifa lot may lose heart retire before get to omdurman once away tremendous business of trying to follow will confront here have got river railway have land carriage for army might keep on falling back to great lake for anything that must do to overtake so hope that mahmud will retire to omdurman without fighting with such host a khalifa must then have must be certain to give battle before abandoning capital be fine looking fellow black gregory said be splendid fellow love fighting for fighting sake be in opinion only worthy occupation for man have shown worthy to fight by side of men have perfect confidence in must believe go anywhere led say be never afraid just like english there seem to be good many woman about camp yes woman follow wherever go cook for generally look after be a warlike a husband encourage when go out to battle with applause curious quavering cry men get very little pay a be provided with ration draw certain amount for woman cost next to nothing fancy having wife with pay well believe must rather be killed than come back face reproach must not wish to have more cheery better fellow with never grumble be always merry really seem to be tireless practically give trouble whatever be good to see how brighten up when there be chance of fight hope will see at before long gregory said now must be going for have to change put on mess uniform before dinner be rather nervous about for be not accustomed to dine with general will find very pleasant other said hunter be splendid fellow be adored by men staff be comparatively young men with none of stiffness of british staff officer about be young there be scarcely man with rank of captain in british army out here be major colonel in egyptian army most of be subaltern in own regiment be good training for at home subaltern be merely machine to carry out order be told to do doe for to think for must be heinous offence be altogether without responsibility without initiative by time becomes field officer be hidebound have never thought for ca be expected to begin to do so after working for twenty year like machine will see if ever have big war will be weak point if be for war like little war in india where men do learn to think take responsibility know where general officer must get training well must be going goodbye will often meet there be so few of here that be always running against other wo ask to dine with for few day doubt must like to get accustomed to headquarters mess first of course hunter brigade staff dine together while have little regimental mess among prefer when there be only three four of one can sit down in one shirt sleeve whereas at brigade mess one must of course turn up in uniform in climate be stifling meal be more pleasant one than gregory have anticipated on board steamer have of course dined with other officer found little difference here ten sat down including principal medical officer captain head of station intelligence department major wingate being at present at wady halfa except for roughness of surroundings be like regimental mess presence of general commanding in way acted a damper to conversation general hunter have before sitting down introduced to member with few pleasant word have put at ease gregory have on way up learned good deal a to officer who be down at cairo for health be able to say who be convalescent who have sailed be on point of sailing for england table be formed of two long bench have be constructed by engineer be laid under large tent of wall have be removed to give free passage of air although scarcely up to standard of mess dinner at home be by mean bad one consisting of soup fish from river joint of beef at one end of mutton at other curried kidney sweet omelette cheese whisky with water soda to drink at dinner after meal four bottle of claret be placed on table cigar pipe hour later four of party sat down to whist rest going outside tent sat threw down on sand smoked chatted till be time to turn in gregory first step next morning be to buy horse purchased from fugitive who have come down from kordofan be good animal though in poor condition must soon pick up flesh when well attended fed to accustom to riding gregory went out on for couple of hour morning getting up before daybreak so a to take exercise before work of day began also followed example of officer of egyptian regiment purchased camel for conveyance of own baggage will find great advantage one of said to of course time may arrive when will have to leave behind a rule there be trouble about at hire native driver who cost practically nothing keep with baggage one asks question when halt for day two have comfort of course with british regiment be cut down to last ounce with be altogether different there being only three four white officer to regiment few extra camel in train make appreciable difference besides black fellow consider quite natural proper that white officer must fare in very different way from whereas british tommy must be inclined to grumble if saw officer enjoying luxury while have to rough a horse only cost three pound camel only five gregory store of money be not seriously affected by purchase for animal although in poor condition from journey from kordofan fortnight rest good feeding did wonder zaki have not much to do gregory be well satisfied with selection have made looked after groomed horse saw that native with camel took care of went down regularly to river to water evening while did same with horse always have jug of cold tea ready for gregory whenever came in floor of tent be kept scrupulously clean zaki only regret be that must not do more for master be consoled by being told that time must soon come when must be more actively engaged from first day of arrival gregory be kept fully employed sometimes assisted officer of intelligence department in interviewing fugitive who have arrived from berber other point on river from kordofan from village on white nile sometimes carried message from general to officer in command of two egyptian brigade have to listen to dispute between native returning to home from have be driven by dervish found in possession of land took note of argument on side submitted to general for decision work must have be trifling in other climate be exhausting in sweltering heat of day be not sorry when sun sank must take off khaki tunic go down to river for swim one evening a be sitting after dinner general hunter said be very annoying that while native making way down country be able to tell good deal of what be taking place on nile from omdurman down to metemmeh while also get news of state of thing at berber abu hamed know nothing whatever of mahmud intention indeed anything of what be doing at metemmeh since be captured by dervish a heard whole population destroyed of course mahmud have choice of three course can stay where be can march whole force to berber can advance against here suppose that have idea of progress railway be making from wady halfa may have heard doubt have heard that be making road of sort across desert in direction of abu hamed of capability of railway can form idea may well believe that march of army across what be practically waterless desert be matter of impossibility on other hand know that be gathering considerable force here with limited knowledge doubtless supposes that be going to cross bayuda desert to metemmeh a gordon relief column did that if be not coming way intend to follow river bank up to berber unquestionably best course if considers a may be sure doe that force under command be strong enough to crush here must be to push across desert fall upon before reinforcement arrive be reported believe truly that khalifa father have positively refused to let do so still son have disobeyed father before now there be be true difficulty of water be not so serious in case of dervish force a be with in first place can march twice a far a can in second place be accustomed to go long time without water be little affected by heat lastly have nothing to carry except weapon few handful of date water gourd still know that force have one after arrived here have be greatly weakened by journey however mahmud may attempt for must know from spy here that have at present such land transport a must be required be intending to advance across desert may therefore move at least portion of force to berber trusting to fact that even did make advance south from here with intention of cutting off retreat to khartoum must be able to reach metemmeh before must get there undoubtedly british general if commanding force constituted a mahmud be must make dash across desert fall upon unless indeed felt certain that after difficulty encountered last time attempted to take desert route must be certain to advance by river step by step continuing policy that have followed since began to push forward from assouan mahmud be in very difficult position be controlled by father at khartoum among with be many important emir men of almost equal rank with must hardly hope that decision might personally arrive at must be generally accepted by who opposed must do so with more force a must declare that in making movement be acting in opposition to father order however total ignorance a to mahmud plan intention be most unfortunate can hardly be helped for naturally native coming down from kordofan give metemmeh very wide berth a to sending up of native here to find out what be going on be out of question for must be detected at once a language be so different from of baggara later on general retired to quarter gregory went there can speak to for few minute sir asked certainly mr hilliard what can do for have be thinking over what be saying regarding information a to mahmud intention with permission be ready to undertake to go into camp to find out what general opinion be a to plan impossible mr hilliard admire courage in making offer must be going to certain death think so sir talk baggara better than negro dialect pass here be among baggara be likely to learn something of father fate a old nurse from whom learnt language have be for long time among tribe devoted at mother request more time to teaching arab dialect than other be convinced that must pas unsuspected among a far a language be concerned there be great difference between arab feature european think that when be stained brown have head partly shaved according to fashion there will be little fear of being detected a to costume be easy enough have not seen of dervish yet native who have come in from el obeid other neighbourhood where be master must give account of dress way in wear patch on clothes be distinguishing mark of mahdist must tell that so must of officer dress differs very little from ordinary arab costume nearly wear loose white trouser coming down to ankle in case be usual baggy eastern article in others leg be separate almost wear white garment coming down to knee with of course sash round waist sleeve reaching down to elbow inch two below wear turban majority simply skullcap must get dress made up in three four hour risk be altogether too great think must be justified in allowing to undertake really think that there will be great danger sir if there be great object to be gained must be different in view of great importance a said evening of learning mahmud intention risk of one life being lost even be great be nothing a say sirdar plan might be greatly affected by course mahmud adopts in such case life of subaltern like be matter scarcely to be considered from childhood have be preparing to go among dervish be what propose doing a soon a khartoum be recaptured therefore sir if by anticipating work by few month possibly year can render service to army must gladly undertake if will give permission to do so general be for minute two silent well hilliard said at last on thinking over a put know must be justified in refusing offer be very gallant one may possibly meet with success thank sir will be really glad to enter upon work have looked forward to although may have direct bearing upon discovery of father fate will be start in direction do think that have better go mounted on foot must say certainly on horseback there be occasion for hasty determination step must be carefully considered must a far a possible foresee provide for emergency may arise think over well time tomorrow will discus again with gregory went straight back to hut come in zaki want to speak to light lamp shut door now sit down there do know country between metemmeh yes master travelled there with father six year ago be difficult to find way be not difficult there be many sign of passage of caravan there be skeleton of camel of english expedition there be very many of must not be difficult even for one who have never passed to find way there be well there be well at howeyat abu halfa at gakdul abu klea also at gubat be to say water will be found nearly day quite day to one on horseback longest distance be from gakdul to abu klea must not be too long for mounted men must even be done by native on foot in long day march do know whether mahmud army be in metemmeh outside town from what have heard most of dervish force be on hill behind town say metemmeh be full of dead that even dervish care to live there baggara be mostly mounted be not most of be so though there be on foot leader of tribesman who fight for khalifa be on horseback most of army be on foot speak baggara language suppose zaki shook head know little arabic not much suppose most of arab tribe in soudan speak dialect very much like baggara yes be everywhere arabic there be little difference can understand other talk together may servant ask why put question yes zaki must not mention what tell to soul zaki will be a silent a grave well be going up dressed a mahdist can speak baggara tongue well be going to try find out what be going to do whether will march to berber come here remain at metemmeh zaki stared at master in speechless amazement gregory must not help smiling at expression of face there doe not seem much difficulty in said can speak with in dialect of dongola baggara language be much easier to because have be accustomed to speak arabic since be child of course skin will be dyed will wear dervish dress there be difficulty in matter must cut in piece lord if found out that be white doubt must there be reason why must find that out must be much more dangerous for to go into camp than must be for in first place can scarcely speak arabic in second must see by feature that be one of jaalin whereas feature when stained must be much more like of arab than yours must where must be most likely to meet dervish first think of be much side of metemmeh at present sometimes party ride down to gakdul have even passed on till be within sight of camp when have found out that well be still unoccupied army here quiet go back again if go on horseback zaki will want someone with who will act a guide who will look after horse mine at place near river where can find hiding place while be away in dervish camp must take lord zaki said quickly must much rather take than anyone else if be willing to go zaki surely will go with lord native said one have ever be so good to a have if lord be killed be ready to die with may count on to do anything that requires even to go with into dervish camp might go a slave lord must not do zaki wish to travel a person who must ride attended by slave people might say 'who be man where doe come from how be that one know man who ride with slave great object will be to enter camp quietly a one who have left hour before when have once entered ask whence came must tell likely story have made up a for example have come from el obeid that be officer of governor there that finding must not get away yielded to request that might come help to drive infidel into sea zaki nodded must be good tale lord for men who have escaped from el obeid have come here have said that khalifa troop there have not be called to join at omdurman for be necessary to keep strong force there a many of tribe of province must rise in rebellion if have chance therefore must not be likely to meet anyone from el obeid in mahmud camp how be zaki that when so many in soudan have suffered at hand of dervish not only remain quiet supply largest part of khalifa army because lord none of can trust others be madness for one tribe to rise a jaalin did at metemmeh dervish wiped out from face of earth many follow because see allah have always given victory to mahdist therefore mahdi must be prophet others join army because village have be destroyed field wasted see other way of saving from starvation there be many who fight because be fond of fighting see how gladly take service with fight against own countryman although be christian suppose be to conquer khalifa tomorrow army must enlist in service if must take man who must be contented to till field if must do so in peace quiet fear that may see produce eaten by others house set on fire must rather leave home fight care not against whom mahdist army be badly fed badly paid can scarce keep life together in egyptian army men be well taken care of have ration pay say that if be wounded lose limb be more able to fight receive pension be wonderful that must come to be faithful well zaki wo talk longer now be agreed then that if go on expedition will accompany certainly master wherever go be ready to go happens to will hope happen to on following afternoon gregory be sent for have given matter good deal of thought mr hilliard general said have decided to accept offer suppose that have be thinking matter over do decide to go on foot mounted on horseback sir boy be perfectly willing to go with know way position of well on road plan be that when get near metemmeh will remain with horse somewhere near river will enter camp on foot be le likely to be noticed way if questioned story will be that father be at el obeid that governor there be by khalifa order holding force in hand to put down outbreak there may be in province that wishing to fight against infidel have come on own account if be asked why have not come on horseback will say that have ridden to within last two three mile that horse have then died expect to be questioned at a one man on foot be a nothing in army of twenty thirty thousand gathered from over soudan quite understand mr hilliard that be taking life in hand that there be possibility whatever of doing anything for if get into trouble quite sir if be detected will probably be killed at once think that there be more risk in than in going into battle a have told have so far a know relative in world there will be one to grieve if never come back again a to clothes can easily buy from one of native here many of be dressed in garment of dervish who be killed when came up here except of course that patch be taken off will get man to buy suit for one for must be better than having new clothes made for even if be dirtied must not look old when have bought clothes can give good washing then get piece of stuff to sew on a patch be afraid sir that there will be little chance of being able to obtain absolute news of mahmud intention only to glean general opinion in camp be not likely that news of intended departure must be kept secret up till last moment among dervish a must be here quite so general agreed may take a certain that matter must be one of common talk of course mahmud principal adviser might change mind at moment still think that be intended to make move against to berber must be generally known may tell that intend to cross bayuda desert will go up river be secret will be kept till last moment before start will do in power to spread belief that be going to advance to metemmeh know that be well informed by spy here of movement will send strong force to make reconnaissance a far a gakdul will appear to be preliminary step to advance must keep mahmud inactive till too late will not dare advance to berber because will be afraid of cutting off from omdurman be satisfied with horse be advisable that must have good one yet not so good a to attract attention yes must not want better horse general be not handsome have ridden great deal be certainly fast being desert bred have doubt have plenty of endurance will of course get one for boy there be plenty in transport yard have be bought up from fugitive who have come in here will write order to select one choose if see one think better than own can take also hand yours over to transport to keep until return must take martini henri with will give order for one on one of native regiment be a know armed with have of course few case of spare rifle good many have fallen into hand of dervish at one time so that carrying such weapon will not excite remark must not do to take revolver doubt will be able to buy pistol have be brought down by fugitive will certainly be able to get at of greek shop buy up that kind of thing of course will carry one of dervish long knife be there anything else that can think of nothing sir when will be ready do suppose by day after tomorrow sir will start after dark so that one will notice going with permission will come round before set off so that can see whether disguise be good enough to pas chapter to metemmeh zaki at once set to work to collect article needed for journey gregory obtained from transport horse two native saddle be well satisfied with own animal even have found in transport yard better horse must still have preferred own a be accustomed to other bought pistol for zaki matchlock for latter everything be ready by time gregory went to mess to lunch on day fixed for departure nothing have be said a to leaving a be possible that of native servant who waited upon might have picked up sufficient english to gather that something important be about to take place when however meal be over said carelessly will not be at mess evening saw by expression of officer face that be aware of reason for absence one after shook hand with gave quiet pat on shoulder with word take care of lad safe journey speedy return other kind wish going to hut be shaved by zaki at back of neck up to ear so that white closely fitting cap must completely cover hair outside tent sauce pan be boiling with herb berry lad have procured from old woman who be considered to have great knowledge of simple at four in afternoon gregory be stained from head to foot two coat of dye being applied used small quantity of liquor rest be poured into gourd for future use dress be ready with exception of mahdi patch be to be sewn on at first halting place before be dark gregory went across to general quarter black sentry stopped general want to speak to gregory said in arabic man called up native sergeant from guard tent who asked what wanted be here by order of general sergeant looked doubtful went in returned in minute motioned to gregory to follow in general looked at from head to foot suppose be hilliard said certainly must not have recognized with yellowish brown skin must pas anywhere a soudan arab will colour last be assured that will last for day be taking enough with to renew four five time well unless unexpected obstacle occurs think be safe from detection mind avoid men from el obeid if fall in with must be safe of course when have sewn on patch disguise will be complete suppose have idea how long will be away will take five day to go there five day to come back must think that if be three day in camp ought to get information required in fortnight must be here though of course may be longer if be not back within few day of time will know that be because have stayed there in hope of getting more certain news if return in three week will be because something have gone wrong hope will not be so lad a regard appearance language have fear of being detected must always bear in mind that there be other point have have advantage of seeing camp of native regiment when men be out of uniform how walk laugh uproariously play trick with other generally behave be native of soudan small proportion of have be follower of mahdi have fought against so may be taken a typical of men be going among be in little matter that will have to be careful now will not detain longer suppose horse be on board have be arranged that gregory must be taken down to korti in native craft be carrying store required at camp yes sir boy put on board two hour ago here be pas by can enter leave british line at time boat will be there before daylight landing of store will not of course take place until later show pas to first officer who come down contains order for to be allowed to start on journey at once other pas be for return have better at first halt sew under one of patch be a see written on piece of linen so however closely may be examined there will be stiffness crackling a must be case with paper now goodbye hilliard be satisfaction to that have undertaken journey on own initiative on own request believe that have fair chance of carrying through more so than men with wider shoulder bigger limb must have if come to grief will blame for having accepted offer will at least know thought over seriously that seeing importance of object in view did not feel justified in refusing with cordial shake of hand said goodbye to gregory latter went off to hut did not leave until dusk then went down to boat where zaki have remained with horse a soon a started lay down alongside bale on deck of native craft be soon asleep did not wake until slight bump told be alongside wharf at korti day be just breaking so no move be made until hour later officer came down with fatigue party to unload store that have brought down when horse be ashore gregory handed pas to officer who be standing on bank looked at with surprise going to do scouting muttered then called to native officer pas two men beyond outpost have order from general hunter will be away long asked gregory in arabic week more lord latter replied ah suppose be going to gakdul a far a have heard there be dervish there well must keep sharp lookout may be in hiding anywhere about there head wo be worth much if lay hand on intend to do so sir then mounting rode on native officer walking beside know country suppose said dervish be bad must rather fall into hand than lose way in desert one be musket ball quick chop with knife other agony for two three day have be along road before zaki said there be fear of losing way even if did so must travel by star wish be moving native said be dull work staying here month after month a soon a be beyond line thanked officer went off at pace native horse be capable of keeping up for hour korti be much pleasanter camp to stay in than merawi gregory said really look delightful place be quite evident that mahdist have never made raid here camp stood on high bank above river there be spreading grove of tree broad avenue have be constructed when gordon relief expedition be encamped there must still be seen beyond be stretch of land have be partly cultivated sevas grass grew plentifully acacia mimosa shrub in patch rode to well of hambok distance of five thirty mile covered in five hour there halted watered horse after giving good feed turned out to munch shrub graze on grass a chose then have meal from food have brought with made shelter of bush for heat be intense afterwards sewed mahdi patch upon clothes when sun went

lay down to sleep moon rose between twelve one after giving horse drink mounted rode to gakdul reached soon after daybreak have stopped mile away zaki went forward on foot hiding a much a possible from observation on return reported that one be at well therefore rode on taking precaution against surprise character of scenery have completely changed have for mile be winding along at foot of jebel el jilif hill be steep precipitous with spur intermediate valley well differed entirely from at hambok be merely hole dug in sand water being brought up in one of skin bag have brought with poured into willow cistern made in surface at well be large pool in rock at foot of one of spur of hill two mile from line of caravan route here water be beautifully clear abundant enough for want of large force be lucky have with zaki for must certainly have gone straight on past well without knowing where be a there be others side of abu klea must have have rather bad day three fort guard have built when came on in advance of general stewart column be still standing a well a number of smaller one have be afterwards added be rather bad place for being caught zaki for ground be so broken rocky that dervish might creep up without being seen yes sir be bad place zaki agreed be glad that none of dervish be here for must not have seen until be quite close zaki have on road cut large faggot of dried stick fire be soon lighted must give horse good allowance of grain gregory said for will be able to pick up nothing here be long ride to abu klea will have to be very careful there lord be not so very far from metemmeh be very likely to find baggaras at well be there met english force went through to metemmeh think must be better for to halt early evening camp at foot of jebel sergain english halted there before advancing to abu klea can take plenty of water in two skin to give horse drink leave enough for tomorrow there be grass in abundance there when moon rise can make way round to avoid abu klea halt in middle of day for hour must then ride on a soon a sun be low halt when becomes too dark to ride then start again when moon rise in way will reach river before be light think must be very good plan zaki must find very difficult to explain who be if met dervish at abu klea will have look at sketch map have found very good accurate so far with compass general gave before starting ought to have difficulty in striking river a direction be only little to east of south opened tin of preserved meat of have four with placed to warm near fire must have have to throw other tin away if have gone on to abu klea said must never have done for to be found upon if be searched when meat be hot ate using biscuit a plate afterwards feasted on melon have brought with be glad to hear horse munching leaf of shrub near when moon rose started be slow work at first a have difficulty in passing rough country lying behind hill once past came upon level plain rode fast for hour at ten o'clock halted lay down under shelter of shrub mounting again at four riding for three hour how far do think be from river now by map must think can not be much more than twenty mile from know lord have never be along here before certainly ought not to be farther than that have ridden nine hour travelled slowly for first four five have come fast since then must give horse good rest so will not move on till moon rise will be about quarter to two doe not give great deal of light now will have to make way through scrub at rate ought to be close to river before morning when sun be low again lit fire have good meal giving greater portion of stock of biscuit to horse good drink of water must use up can eat before tomorrow zaki betake ourselves to diet of dried date there be enough water left to give horse drink before start then will start a genuine dervish found that calculation have made a to distance be correct before daybreak arrived on bank of nile at once encamped in grove in morning must see house of metemmeh rising from line of sandy soil five mile away there seems to be plenty of bush cover along bank zaki will stay here till evening then move three mile farther down so that may be handy if have to leave dervish in hurry must not go into camp lord must be much better in respect if must see speak arabic master must say be carried off a slave when be boy see do speak little arabic must understand simple order just a slave boy must if have be eight ten year among arab must certainly be great advantage to have horse handy however at first will go in join dervish see how encamp be doubt good deal scattered if must find quiet spot where few mounted men have taken up station must join before did that must be necessary to find out whether came from kordofan from of village on white nile must never do to stumble into party from el obeid remained quiet day wood extended hundred fifty yard back from river there be little fear that anyone coming down from omdurman must enter when within sight of metemmeh at dusk rode on again until judged that be within two mile of town then entering clump of high bush by river halted for night chapter among dervish in morning gregory started alone a soon a be light a neared town saw that there be several native craft on river that boat be passing to fro between town shendy on opposite bank from water side number of men be carrying what appeared to be bag of grain towards hill behind town while others be straggling down towards river without being questioned gregory entered metemmeh stopped there for very few minute everywhere be body of men woman child of donkey other animal be now shrivelled dried by sun stench be almost unbearable be glad to hurry away once beyond wall made for hill many tent must be seen there great number of men moving about felt sure that among so many one must notice that be newcomer after moving among throng soon sat down among number of dervish who be eating morning meal taking date out of bag munched quietly from talk going on soon perceived that there be considerable amount of discontent at long delay of men be in favour of moving to berber on ground that must at least fare better there majority be eager to march north to drive infidel from merawi dongola mahmud must do be sure one of said if have will how must march without provision be said that mahmud have asked for sufficient supply to cross bayuda have promised to drive infidel before to assouan khalifa say must be better to wait till come in strong body then to exterminate if be not to fight why be sent here must have be better to stay at omdurman because there have plenty of food if ran short must march to village take what wanted of course khalifa know best to seems strange indeed there be general chorus of assent after listening for time gregory rose passing over ridge came upon main camp here be number of emir sheik with banner flying before entrance of tent whole ground be thickly dotted with little shelter formed of bush over dark blanket be thrown to keep out ray of sun everywhere woman be seated standing talking to other others engaged in cooking child played about boy came in loaded with faggot have gone long distance to cut in place number of horse be picketed showing where baggara cavalry be stationed in neighbourhood of emir tent there be sort of attempt at order in arrangement of little shelter showing where men of tribe be encamped beyond straggling out for distance be small encampment in of men be still erecting shelter with bush woman boy brought in most of be evidently fresh arrival who have squatted down a soon a came up either from ignorance a to where friend have encamped from preference for quiet situation fringe of new arrival extended along whole semicircle of camp a several small party came up while gregory wandered about saw that notice be taken of by already established thought that must bring zaki horse up without fear of close questioning therefore walked down again to spot where have left mounting rode to camp making wide sweep so a to avoid front facing metemmeh must camp equally well anywhere here zaki may a well go round to extreme left a if have to ride off suddenly will at least start from nearest point to line by came there be small clump of bush hundred yard so from nearest of little shelter here dismounted at once began with knife to cut down of bush to form screen from sun have watered horse before left river have also filled water skin think must find better place zaki gregory said when having completed shelter thrown blanket over lay down in shade doubt will soon be joined by others a be first comer on spot will be for to ask question of after for to make enquiry of will go into camp a soon a heat abates people begin to move about again remember story be carried off from jaalin village in raid master be small sheik be now with force at el obeid have be companion of son when latter made up mind to come fight here master gave freedom so that might fight by son side might say have not yet settled under whose banner will fight wish be to be in front of battle when meet infidel will be quite sufficient there be men here from almost village in soudan one will care much where neighbour come from mention that intend to fight a matchlock men not on horseback a animal be greatly fatigued from long journey will require rest for time being so far from home fear that might lose if went into fight with in case might have to journey on foot for long time before must get others at suppose that will be necessary for to say people will be too much occupied with own affair to care much about others still be well not to hesitate if questioned talk laughter in great camp ceased now be not until sun lost power that again began gregory did not move till began to get dusk will be away time said so be at uneasy about will take black blanket so can cover with lie down a if asleep close to of emir tent where hear talk going on so may be able to gather idea a to view have already learned that tribesman have not heard of immediate move be discontented at being kept inactive so long leader however may have plan will not make known to men until be time for action camp be thoroughly alive when entered men be sitting about in group woman a before keeping near little shelter laughing chatting together sometimes quarrelling from manner of men who either sat walked about be not difficult for gregory to distinguish between villager who have be dragged away from home forced to enter service of khalifa baggara kindred tribe who have so long held soudan in subjection former be quiet in demeanour sometimes sullen in look have doubt that when fighting came must face death at hand of infidel a bravely a oppressor for belief in mahdism be now universal follower have proved invincible have doubt that must destroy army of egypt resented being dragged away from quiet home family field among baggara strode haughtily splendid men for most part tall lithe muscular men with supreme belief in in cause carrying a norman baron might have done among crowd of saxon conqueror of land most trusted follower of successor of mahdi men who felt invincible be true that have so far failed to overrun egypt have even suffered revers khalifa have taught to consider be due to disobedience of order result of fighting upon unlucky day be soon to be reversed prophecy have told that infidel be about to be annihilated that then must sweep down without opposition posse of plunder of egypt gregory passed wholly unnoticed among crowd there be nothing to distinguish from others thought that egyptian spy still le one of infidel must venture into camp have never occurred to one of multitude occasionally sat down near group of baggara listening to talk be impatient too be convinced that be for best that when be will of allah must destroy enemy still there be expression of impatience that mahmud be not allowed to advance know one said that be at kirkeban that last great destruction of infidel be to take place that madman be coming to fate still might move down destroy at dongola along river posse ourselves of arm store why must come thus far from omdurman if be to go farther why ask question said contemptuously enough that be command of khalifa to whom power knowledge have be given by mahdi until return to earth to khalifa will be revealed day hour on be to smite infidel if mahmud great emir be content to wait why must be impatient everywhere gregory went heard same feeling expressed men be impatient to be up doing must wait appointed hour be late before ventured to approach tent of leader knew that be impossible to get near mahmud for have own bodyguard of picked men night however be dark enveloping from head to foot in black blanket crawled out until well beyond line of tent then very cautiously made way towards again knew that must see white figure of dervish before must make out managed unnoticed to crawl up to one of largest tent lie down against heard chatter of woman in adjoining tent there be sound in against lay for hour be quiet then saw two white figure coming from mahmud camp lay fifty yard away to delight stopped at entrance of tent by be concealed one said can well understand ibrahim khalim that brother mahmud be sorely vexed that father will not let advance against egyptian at merawi fully share feeling for must not with cavalry sweep before into river even though footman came with according to account be two three thousand strong have a many horseman under command be so osman azrakyet methinks father be right if be to march across desert must lose very many men great number of animal must arrive weakened dispirited if remain here be egyptian who will have to bear hardship of march across desert great number of animal carry baggage food without poor infidel be unable to march must die weakened force must be easy prey for be true other said may come now a came to dongola in boat have cataract to ascend rapid current of nile at full to struggle against there be strong force at abu hamed governor at berber will move down there with force when hears that egyptian be coming up cataract must be will of allah that must pas reach berber will know how to meet have settled evening that many strong fort be to be built on river bank here if infidel try to advance farther by water will be sunk agree with mahmud wish that have be otherwise that must hurl ourselves at once upon egyptian prevent coming farther must be partial success if wait will gather force before come will destroy at one blow then will seize store animal cross desert to dongola march forward to assouan there wait till khalifa brings own army then who be to oppose will conquer land of infidel be a eager for day of battle a be seems to that be best to wait here until infidel come feel that be wise of khalifa thus to order now will to tent a soon a ibrahim khalim have entered tent gregory crawled away well satisfied that have gained exactly information have come to gather have gone few pace when saw white figure striding along in front of tent stopped threw down unfortunately path taken by sheik be directly towards heard footstep advancing in hope that man must pas either in front behind then felt sudden kick exclamation heavy fall leapt to foot arab sheik be a quick springing up also seized at same time drawing knife uttering loud shout gregory grasped arab wrist without hesitation snatched own knife from sash drove deep into assailant body latter uttered loud cry for help score of men rushed from behind tent gregory set off at top of speed dashed over brow of bridge then without entering camp there kept along close to crest running at top of speed wrapping blanket a much a possible round heard outburst of yell behind felt sure that sheik have wounded have told who have rushed up way have fled with loud shout poured over crest there be joined by others running up from camp when gregory paused for moment after running for three four hundred yard must hear sound of footstep behind glancing round must not see white dress in darkness turning sharply off recrossed crest of hill keeping close to continued flight until well past end of camp alarm have by time spread everywhere wild medley of shout rose throughout whole area of encampment turned now made for spot where have left zaki horse in five minute reached be that lord zaki asked a came up yes must fly at once be discovered have to kill at least badly wound sheik be searching for everywhere have saddled horse put water skin on be well done zaki let mount be off at once will lead horse be too dark to gallop among bush sound of hoof might be heard will go quietly till be well away not word be spoken till have gone mile will mount now zaki horse can see better than will go at walk dare not strike light to look at compass there be star see north star must be hidden by mist lower down others give direction quite near enough to go by be most unfortunate that fellow who rushed against be sheik must see that by outline of robe if have be common man there must not have be fuss over a be will search for high low know be killed on spot for shouted after have left be likely to guess from account have be down at one of emir tent be probably spy know ought to have paused moment given stab must not bring to do be one thing to stab man who be trying to take one life be quite when have fallen be helpless zaki have made no reply must scarcely understand master repugnance to making matter safe when blow must have done so be not for to blame travelled night when moon rose be able to get along somewhat faster light be now feeble uncertain a soon a day broke rode fast at ten o'clock have left behind range of hill stretching between well of abu klea jebel sergain ought to be safe now gregory said a dismounted at rate horse must have rest have done over forty mile be safe for present lord depends whether not think be spy if come to conclusion will send at once to abu klea if strong body be stationed there may have sent party on to gakdul even to el howeyat for will feel sure that will make for one of well how much water have got in bag zaki examined enough for ourselves for five six day only enough for two drink for horse for ourselves for couple of day be bad if have have idea of coming away so soon must have filled large bag yesterday have intended to send down horse in morning therefore left only half full must have leaked good deal to get so low see if one leak more than other be found that one held water well from other there be steady drip transferred water from to sound bag must drink a little a can zaki give horse only mouthful now then let munch shrub get little moisture from do think there be fear of dervish following track lord in first place know that there be two of that be mounted when who camped near notice when get up morning that have moved will only think that have shifted camp a there be talk of horseman being concerned in affair think will attempt to follow except along caravan road feel sure will pursue on line rested for hour in shade of high rock leaving horse to pick what herbage must find at four o'clock started again have ridden two hour when zaki said see lord there be two men on top of jebel sergain gregory gazed in direction yes can notice now must not have done so if have not seen be on watch lord well can hardly see at distance may be sure that see zaki said eye of arab be very keen must not fail to catch two moving object especially horseman if be looking for have seen zaki must not be standing stationary there not if be alone others may have be with when first caught sight of may have be hour ago others may have gone down to abu klea while two remained to watch course took arab can signal with lance with horse from there must be able to direct party in pursuit of well must keep on a hard a can till dark after can take quietly see difficulty with will be water now that have once made out two horseman riding north must know that have special object in avoiding will doubt send party to gakdul if not farther crossed rough country a quickly a must then again broke into canter hour later a crossed slight rise zaki looked back there be horseman in pursuit lord have evidently come from abu klea gregory looked round there be about fifteen of said however be good three mile behind will be dark in half hour a soon a be so will turn off to right left so throw off track hurry horse animal have made very long journey since started will want badly tomorrow in half hour sun went down darkness come on quickly in soudan in quarter of hour have lost sight of pursuer who have gained about mile upon five minute zaki to allow for eye being better than ours way do think have better turn must say to left lord there be caravan route from metemmeh to ambukol can not be more than fifteen mile to west do know anything about have never be along there be shorter route than one to korti not so much used believe because well can not be relied upon well feel sure will not be able to get at well on other line so have better take that a will be fairly safe from pursuit may a well bear towards northwest by doing so will be longer in striking track journey will be good bit shorter than if be to ride due west now can safely dismount be getting pitch dark will lead horse can feel mine be nearly dead beat in few minute will halt give gourd full of water after that have better go on for six seven mile so a to be well out of sight of anyone on hill ten minute later heard dull sound of horse hoof on sand waited five minute until died away in distance then continued course be slow work a have to avoid bush carefully lest if pursuer halted must hear crackling of dry stick in still air zaki who must see much better in dark than master went on ahead while gregory led two horse good hour passed before stopped gave horse scanty drink took mouthful two then throwing down allowed horse to crop scanty herbage after four hour halt pursued way on foot for three hour laying course by star calculated that must have gone good fifteen mile from point where turned off feared that might miss caravan track if went on before daybreak chapter safely back a soon a sun be up pursued journey gregory compass being now available in hour zaki said there be sign of track lord pointed to skeleton of camel how many more mile do think have to go zaki must be good half way lord yes quite must think looking at map must say that must be about abreast of line of gakdul route be only just indicated there be halting place marked upon still there must be water otherwise caravan must not use have about sixty mile farther to go so that if horse be fresh might be there evening a be have still two if not three day journey before well must hope that will find water just let horse wet mouth can keep on for bit before have drink how much more be there left asked after lad have given little water to horse not above two gourdfuls well must ride a far a can at rate must keep one gourdful for tomorrow if cover twenty five mile today think horse can do more can manage if be entirely done up to walk other thirty five mile however a said there must be well even if be dry may be able to scratch sand out find little water what food have got only about two pound of date be poor supply for two day zaki must make best of will only eat few today so a to have fair meal in morning will want if have to walk thirty five mile over sand will not be sand zaki said there be grass for last fifteen mile near river there be cultivated field about ten mile out before dervish came be better now will be moving herbage horse have cropped during halt have served to certain degree to supply place of water proceeded at brisker pace than gregory have expected keep sharp lookout for water even if well be dry will see difference in growth of bush round a be certain that route have not be used for time there may even be grass rode on at easy canter avoided pressing horse in slightest degree allowing to walk whenever chose heat be very great after four hour riding gregory called halt must have done twenty mile said bush look green about here horse have got something of feed think must be one of old halting place zaki said looking round a dismounted see lord there be broken gourd rag scattered about so there be gregory said will take

gregory be hard work be not until after four hour toil that to delight found sand wet under foot have taken by turn to use scoop for labour of making hole large enough for to work at once must have be excessive in hour there be inch of water in hole gregory took gourd buried in soft soil until water flowed in over brim give other one down zaki will fill too then will start drinking together five minute later two took long draught scoop be then refilled carried to horse who drank with eagerness showed how great be thirst three time gourd be filled emptied now hand down water bag be half filled then exhausted with work threw down slept for hour when awoke sun be setting bring up horse zaki let drink a much a like gourd have to be filled six time before animal be satisfied rider then took deep drink ate handful of date mounted be safe now only have to fear band of marauding arab must be hard luck be to fall in with have better ride slowly for first hour so must not press horse after have have drink very well master there be particular reason for hurry even if miss trail know that by keeping straight on will strike river somewhere near korti ambukol for hour went at walk then horse broke into usual pace of own accord be getting dark now soon even zaki must not make out track horse will keep to lord said sight be great deal better than ours dare say smell may have something to do with besides track be clear of bush so must know at once if strayed from rode for five hour then felt that horse be beginning to fag will halt here gregory said certainly can not be more than five twenty mile from river if start at dawn will be there before heat of day begin can have handful of date give horse handful will leave few for morning horse after being given date be again turned loose be not long before be heard pulling leaf off bush case be good deal better evening than be yesterday gregory said then looked a if must be rather close thing for be sure horse must not have gone

leader said where be friend going why do halt be on mission wish to see if infidel be still at ambukol for will not want gun man said need badly beg of to give to may be of use to may come upon infidel scout nevertheless friend must hand over to be a see eight be only two law of desert be that stronger take weaker lose may be so sometimes gregory said quietly not in case advise to ride way will ride ours then said to zaki dismount stand behind horse fire over saddle fire first shot now threw from saddle scarcely have done so when four shot be fired gregory took steady aim at chief latter threw up arm fell with yell of fury others dashed forward zaki did not fire until be within twenty yard directly afterwards gregory fired again there be now five assailant now for pistol zaki

so be friend gregory shouted in arabic zaki repeated shout in own language soldier looked doubtful stood together in group knew that dervish be sometimes ready to throw away own life if must kill of enemy one of shouted back stay where be until officer went back to tent returned with white officer whom gregory at once recognized a one of who have come up with from wady halfa leslie shouted in english will kindly call off soldier one of musket might go off accidentally suppose remember be hilliard who came up with in steamer officer have stopped in astonishment at hearing seeming dervish address by name in then advanced giving order to men to fall back be really hilliard said a approached horseman who be coming forward at walk of be for see resemblance in of be leslie be not surprised

having made hearty meal gregory related adventure with arab in desert merely saying that have found there be dervish at gakdul why did go straight back instead of coming down here wanted to see whether line be open whether there be well on only found one took four five hour hard work to get at water be lucky indeed that did so for horse be getting very done up have begun to think that must

authoritative voice called orderly soldier came down directly from guard room tell general at once mr hilliard have returned with look of wonder orderly went into tent half minute later returned be to come in said a general have seen gregory in disguise before starting of course recognized dear hilliard said getting up shaking cordially by hand be heartily glad to see back have be frequently in thought though have confidence in sharpness have regretted more than once that allowed to go suppose failed to get there be hardly possible that must have done so in time suppose when got to gakdul

of rd egyptian th th th soudanese together with mule battery be to move forward next day to kassinger advanced post ten mile higher up river seemed only preliminary step general opinion be that fortnight must elapse before there must be general movement reconnaissance with friendly arab have however be made ahead towards abu hamed have obtained certain information that garrison at place be by mean strong one information gregory have gathered have shown that mahmud have intention of advancing against merawi that reinforcement have a yet started to join force at abu hamed dervish leader being convinced that nile be not yet high enough to admit of boat going up cataract thus everything favoured sirdar plan to capture abu hamed enable railway to be constructed to place before mahmud must receive news that troop be in motion therefore directed general hunter to push forward with only one brigade leaving rest to hold merawi ordered camel corp friendly arab to advance across desert

relative advantage of night day march agreed that if only one march have to be done be better to do at night when a in present case must last for seven eight day many thought terrible a must be heat must be better to march in day permit troop to sleep at night opinion certainly seemed to be justified for at end of third day men be so completely worn out from want of sleep that stumbled a marched be with difficulty restrained from throwing down to get much needed rest gregory always went down a soon a column arrived at halting place a did before starting in evening to bathe in quiet pool

edge of steep slope that looked down to town must see one moving about dervish trench about eighty yard away appeared empty be about to write message to general saying that place be deserted when sharp fire suddenly opened upon turned to ride back to warn general be too late for at same moment hunter with staff galloped up to edge of slope be immediately saluted by heavy volley however be fired so wildly that none of party be hit artillery be now ordered to bombard place at first must only fire at top of house changing position found spot where must command town for hour continued infantry be drawn up just beyond brow where must not be seen by defender dervish gave sign of life a artillery must not depress gun sufficiently to enable to rake trench infantry be ordered to charge a soon a reached edge of dip storm of musketry broke out from dervish trench fortunately greater portion of bullet flew overhead macdonald have intended to carry place at point of bayonet without

round a rode up answered with nod when saluted asked if must come felt rather scared on dervish opening fire so suddenly when general impatience have led to ride forward without waiting for major kincaid report after troop rushed into town general maintained position at edge of dip for narrow street be so crowded with men that group of horseman must hardly have forced way in must be impossible to see what be going on to issue order mahomed zein have not followed example of of follower died fighting to last be found hiding under bed be brought before general hunter who asked why fought when must have known that be useless to replied knew that have only three time a many a have one of men be worth four of yours must not fire till be quite close up at range rifle be a good a yours general asked what thought mahmud must do to replied will be down here in five day wipe out be necessary to halt at abu hamed until store came up captain keppel royal navy officer commanding gunboat be toiling at cataract to bring up nevertheless one of be capsized only three got through safely major pink with large number of troop from merawi succeeded in hauling sailing boat through large column of laden camel be at same time being pushed forward by caravan route from korosko be time of much anxiety till store began to arrive for have mahmud advanced at once passage up river must have be arrested land column cut off in case little force must have be reduced to sore strait a must have stood on defensive until reinforcement reached there be too anxiety a to safety of force at ambukol korti for mahmud on learning that garrison have be weakened by despatch of troop to abu hamed might have crossed desert with force fallen upon mahmud have indeed a turned out believed that expedition to abu hamed be only undertaken to cover flank of egyptian army from attack from quarter still believed that be from merawi that main british force must advance against before supply have arrived position changed a news came that berber be being evacuated by dervish information be telegraphed to sirdar who at once ordered that force of friendly arab escorted by gunboat must go up to berber to find if news be true one gunboat have already arrived general hunter decided on going up in two hundred of arab under ahmed bey be to ride along bank be to be mounted on fastest camel must be picked out so that if encountered dervish must have fair chance of escaping getting under cover of gunboat fire mr hilliard general said will be obliged if will accompany ahmed bey arab be always more steady if have english officer with will be ready to start in hour signaller from th soudanese will go with can notify to approach of strong party of enemy direction so that gunboat can send shell two among a hint that have better keep out of range a baggage camel be by mean fast one gregory at first decided to leave behind in charge of zaki on going across to arab camp ahmed bey at once offered to place fast one at disposal accordingly sent own animal into transport yard committed heavy wooden case with greater portion of remaining store to charge of sergeant of mess retaining only three four tin of preserved milk tea four five tin of meat bottle of brandy few other necessary to be added sheep few pound of rice with tent other belonging be packed on arab camel zaki rode beside with great satisfaction for have be greatly cast down when master first told that must have to remain behind preparation be made in great haste be completed just a ahmed bey moved out of camp with two hundred picked men camel five minute later whistle from steamer told that general hunter party with be also on point of starting distance to be traversed to berber be hundred thirty mile expedition be undoubtedly hazardous one even if news be true that five thousand dervish who have be holding berber have evacuated town be quite possible that part of force have be sent down river to oppose advance might be made if unable to do to carry news of advance to mahmud arab be to keep abreast of gunboat must where shore be flat be covered by gun at spot where ground be high precipitous assistance must scarcely avail in case of attack unless hundred soldier on board steamer must be landed a rode along ahmed bey explained to gregory plan that must adopt if be attacked in position found retreat cut off camel will be made to lie down will fight behind a in entrenchment men be armed with rifle government have given must beat off attack by great number while if be on camel pursued must soon lose order shooting must be bad think must be by far best plan sheik two hundred men hundred gunboat must land ought to be able to make tough fight of against number of enemy how long do think will be on way about four day camel can easily travel thirty five mile day have six day provision with in case gunboat can not make way up fortunately have not to carry water so that camel only take twenty pound of food for rider forty pound of grain for if be pursued must throw away a must only have to ride to point where gunboat must protect must not hope to escape by speed for dervish must ride run quite a fast a camel must go chapter afloat first three day journey passed without adventure from native who still remained in little village passed learned that report that dervish have left berber be generally believed whether have marched for metemmeh for other point be unknown people be delighted to see gunboat a until arrival have be in hourly fear of raiding party have heard of capture of abu hamed by british from horseman who have escaped have said confidently that mahmud must speedily drive out again have be in hourly fear that dervish must swoop down upon carry off few possession still remaining to when within thirty mile of berber arab have halted on bank watching gunboat a with great difficulty made way up cataract suddenly be seen to stop great bustle be observed on board exclamation of grief burst from arab have struck on rock ahmed bey exclaimed be afraid have said gregory who have along ridden by side at head of party be afraid so hope be not injured unfortunately damage be serious hole have be knocked through side under water water poured in in volume rush be made by on board bed pillow blanket be stuffed into hole succeeded to extent be brought alongside bank sheik gregory went down to meet general hunter came to side large hole have be knocked in said to sheik will have to get gun store on shore to lighten then heel over to get at hole will certainly take two three day by time hope other gunboat will be up in meantime must go on to berber think there can be doubt that dervish have left be most important that must know for certain must push straight on a soon a arrive there send word on to by fastest camel have if be attacked will of course defend yourselves take up position close to river hold until be relieved if can send off news to by camel do so if not seize boat there be at village send news down by water will come on at once with everyone here to assist will do a order sheik said if see more will know that died a brave men hope there be fear of that general said cheerfully will defend yourselves a brave men if be attacked be sure a be convinced that dervish have left berber think there be little fear of falling in with then went on in english to gregory keep moving mr hilliard let go a fast a can be le likely to get nervous if be riding hard than must be if dawdled along if press camel will be in berber afternoon see that man start at once to bring news very well sir will keep at if can sheik rejoined band gathered round to hear result of interview with white general steamer be injured said will soon be made right will follow be to have honour of going on occupying berber will show worthy of there be little chance of meeting dervish have be in berber must have heard of before if meet will fight abu who have fastest camel among will ride back here at speed general soldier will come up to help now let not waste moment push forward in five hour will be at berber throughout life will be proud to say that be first to enter town that dervish have so long held few of men waved gun shouted rest looked grave however obeyed chief order cavalcade at once started a did so gregory drew horse up alongside zaki look here said if see dervish coming in force will come to at once will take horse be faster than yours will give note for general will ride back at full gallop give to horse be fast there will be fear of catching even if chase will not be likely to do a will be thinking of attacking very well master will do a order must rather stop fight by side that may be able to do other time zaki time have got to fetch aid then rode on to join chief there be talking along line man have rifle unslung in hand eye scanned country hitherto have have unlimited faith in power of gunboat to protect now that might have to face dervish unaided felt danger serious one have come to fight dervish be ready to do so in anything like equal number force might meet must possibly be greatly stronger than own so strong that although might sell life dearly must in end be overpowered for first three hour camel be kept going at top of speed a neared berber there be perceptible slackness ahmed bey gregory rode backwards forward along line keeping together encouraging will get in without fighting bey said must have heard before have be there do think that must have remained so long in town if have learned that there be two hundred of one steamer mahmud must never have forgiven have not fallen upon annihilated only hope that two hundred will have be left there will add to glory to have won battle a well a taken town child will talk of in tent woman will be proud of men of black regiment will say that have shown ourselves to be a brave a be will halt for hour rest camel then push on at full speed again mind have order if must see enemy coming in force be to ride at once to river bank dismount make camel lie down in semicircle then have to keep calm shoot straight need not fear dervish however many of there may be after halt again pushed forward gregory saw with pleasure that arab be now thoroughly wound up to fighting point same vigilant watch be kept up a before air of gloom have hung over when first started have now disappeared man be ready to fight to last a town be seen tension be at highest pace quickened rather than relaxed now be moment bey shouted if be there will come out to fight if in five minute appear will be because have gone there be sign of enemy cloud of dust rising in town must tell of hasty gathering at last entered straggling street woman looked timidly from window then on seeing that robe did not bear black patch worn by dervish broke into loud cry of welcome be dervish gone ahmed bey asked reining in camel be gone last left four day ago sheik waved rifle over head follower burst into loud shout of triumph pressed on firing musket in air a proceeded native poured out from house in wild delight arab kept on till reached house formerly occupied by egyptian governor must say that have better take possession of bey there seems to be large courtyard where can put camel be not likely that dervish will return be a well to be prepared house be strong must hold out here against host unless be provided with cannon have money have better buy up a much food a possible so that must stand siege for time will give horse good feed hour rest then send man down to general telling that dervish have deserted town that have taken possession of place can defend for long time must return hour later zaki started with gregory report inhabitant finding that must be paid brought out hidden store by evening enough be collected to last garrison ten day zaki returned at noon next day with letter from general hunter to sheik praising highly for energy courage of men

down upon at once embark in boat cross to island will be time before can gather here force strong enough to hold town against attack indeed will probably be week for until railway be finished to abu hamed can only get up store sufficient for men here certainly have transport must keep up supply for whole force however will be settled by sirdar who will very shortly be with be now th of september same afternoon two gunboat be sent up to ed important position lying mile two beyond junction of atbara river with nile on opposite bank of nile found encamped dervish who have retired from berber gun

rapid on camel then again placed in boat so brought to berber macdonald brigade started fortnight after occupation place at abu hamed having be taken by brigade from kassinger battalion having towed up boat carrying two month supply of provision fort be now erected at junction of two river occupied by small force under english officer two small steamer be employed in towing native craft from abu

be occasion to put in order authorization be sufficient a long a be on staff did not matter a presently may be attached to egyptian regiment be a well that must bear usual rank may save misunderstanding in communicating with native will be much more respected a bimbashi than must be a lieutenant title that must not understand ' good many lieutenant in british army be bimbashis here so that there be nothing unusual in holding that honorary rank must just a soon be lieutenant sir so far a be concerned of course feel honoured at receiving title doubt must be much more pleasant if be attached to egyptian regiment know whether be proper thing to thank sirdar if be will be greatly obliged if will convey thanks to will tell that be greatly gratified hilliard have doubt owe not only to ride to metemmeh to report did not think ahmed bey must have ventured to ride on into berber have not be with that advised a to defensive position took up here prepared for stout defence until

virtue everywhere especially on board ship where everything go by clockwork eight bell will sound in two minute a do so black fellow will come up announce meal be breakfast a much a mine for have shipped on book morning of course will be rationed happily be not confined to fare knew what be going to be laid in good stock of store fortunately have advantage over military that be not limited a to baggage breakfast be excellent one after be over commander keppel asked gregory how be that have while still so young obtained commission expressed much interest when have heard story then intend to remain in egyptian army said if have not fixed career before must have thought that must not do better sirdar general hunter have taken great interest in might be necessary perhaps for to enter british army serve for two three year so a to get knowledge of drill discipline then from acquaintance with language here must of course get transferred to egyptian army where must rank a major at once have hardly thought of future yet sir of course will have to do so a soon a be absolutely convinced of father death really have hope now promised mother to do everything in power to ascertain for certainty placed packet in hand be not to be opened until have so satisfied know what contains believe relates to father family see that can make difference to for certainly must not care to go home to see relation to whom coming might be unwelcome must greatly prefer to stay out here for few year until have obtained position a must make absolutely independent of can quite understand captain keppel said poor relation seldom get warm welcome a be born in alexandria may be altogether unaware of existence have certainly be extremely fortunate so far if preferred civil appointment must be pretty certain of getting one when war be over there will be big job in organizing country after dervish be smashed up biggish staff of official will be wanted doubt most of will be egyptian egyptian official want looking after so that good many berth must be filled by englishman englishman with knowledge of arabic negro dialect be not very easily found must say that there will be excellent opening for young men of capacity have doubt there will gregory said have really never thought much about future attention from childhood have be fixed upon journey to soudan never looked beyond did mother discus future with doubtless must have done so have lived paper have may give advice opinion about well must be going on deck captain keppel said will start in hour three gunboat be of same design be flat bottomed so a to draw a little water a possible have be built sent out in section from england be constructed entirely of steel have three deck lower one having loophole shutter for infantry fire on upper deck be extended over whole length of boat be conning tower in after portion of boat beneath upper deck be cabin for officer boat carried twelve pounder quick firing gun forward howitzer four maxim craft be hundred thirty five foot long with beam of twenty four foot drew only three foot half of water be propelled by stern wheel at half past nine zafir whistle gave signal consort nazie fatteh cast off warp steamed out into river boat have on board two european engineer fifty men of th soudanese two sergeant of royal marine artillery small native crew expect that will not make many more trip down to berber commander said when be once fairly off camp at atbara will be headquarters unless indeed mahmud advance in case of course will be recalled until then will be patrolling river up to metemmeh making hope occasional rush a far a next cataract when evening came on steamer tied up to island few mile north of shendy so far have seen no hostile party indeed country be wholly deserted next morning started before daybreak shendy seemed to be in ruin two arab only be seen on bank few shot be fired into town there be reply hour later metemmeh be seen stood mile from river along bank be seven mud fort with extremely thick solid wall keeping near opposite bank gunboat led by zafir made way up river dervish horseman must be seen riding from fort to fort doubtless carrying order river be four thousand yard wide at distance gunboat opened fire at two nearest fort range be soon obtained to nicety white sergeant native gunner made splendid practice shell bursting upon fort while maxim speedily sent dervish horseman galloping off to distant hill on must be made out large camp dervish gunner replied promptly range be too great for old brass gun most of shot fell short though few fired at great elevation fell beyond boat one shell however struck zafir passing through deck killing soudanese shrapnel shell burst over fatteh after hour fire at range gunboat moved up opposite position again opened fire with shell shrapnel committing terrible havoc on fort whose fire presently slackened suddenly be explained by fact that a gunboat passed up saw that embrasure of fort only commanded approach from north once past enemy be unable to bring gun to bear upon boat doubtless dervish have considered be impossible for steamer to pas up under fire that be therefore unnecessary to widen embrasure so that gun must fire upon when facing fort going beyond suddenly a on board be watching effect of fire outburst of musketry broke out from bush lined eastern bank hundred yard away fortunately greater part of bullet flew overhead many rattled against side maxim be instantly turned upon unseen enemy soudanese fired volley rash assailant went at once into thicker bush many dropping before gained gunboat now steamed slowly up river then turning retired downstream again shelling enemy position a passed a be going down came upon number of dervish who be busy unloading dozen native craft maxim soon sent flying boat contained horse donkey grain other good be taken in tow by gunboat anchored at same island a on previous night well bimbashi captain keppel said when work for day be over so have have first brush with enemy what do think of must rather that did not call bimbashi captain keppel title be ridiculous for be only given that might be useful when with egyptian soudanese soldier must feel really obliged if must simply call hilliard felt right sir during fight except envied gunner who be doing something while have nothing to do look on certainly made jump when shell struck boat because have quite made up mind that gun must not carry so far so be complete surprise to yes be very harmless affair still be good a preparation for something more severe have got accustomed to noise now be always a great trial to nerve a actual danger wish must be doing something sir everyone else have duty from down to black fireman even servant made useful in carrying up shot tell will do mr hilliard will get marine sergeant to instruct in working of maxim in duty of men attending on then next time come up will put in command of one of duty will not be severe a must simply direct men a to object at be to aim watch effect direction of bullet see that change aim a circumstance may direct black gunner be well trained know work still if by chance gun jam will be useful for to be able to show what to do even though know a well a better than do black like being commanded by white officer will feel pleased rather than otherwise at being appointed to command gun lesson can not begin for day two for have not done with metemmeh yet be very much obliged to indeed gregory said warmly will take care not to interfere with men working of gun will not have to do word two of commendation when make good practice plea immensely will work better faster for standing by at daybreak next morning gunboat went up again engaged fort a before dervish have placed more gun in position again shell fell short while of boat played havoc with enemy defence ten thousand of dervish horse foot came down near town in readiness to repel attempt at landing after hour bombardment gunboat retired a steamed away dervish host be shouting waving banner evidently considering that have won great victory having fulfilled object be to retain mahmud at metemmeh by showing that if advanced against merawi dongola have in power to occupy town so cut off retreat prevent reinforcement store from reaching from omdurman gunboat returned to berber so far gregory have have duty to perform in capacity of interpreter for prisoner have be taken on way down river one of artillery sergeant explained working of maxim to taking weapon to piece explaining to how part acted then showing how to put together again sergeant having done several time gregory be then told to perform operation lesson continued after arrival at berber in course of week be able to do smartly have learned in case of breakdown part of mechanism must most probably have given way how to replace broken part by spare one carried up for purpose there be long rest at berber on st of november gunboat again went up river reinforced by metemmeh have now arrived boat a before carried fifty soldier major stuart wortley went up a staff officer evening before starting received welcome

town large dervish camp be seen in valley afterwards found be occupied by force have returned from berber heavy fire of shell shrapnel be opened upon be speedily destroyed gunboat then went up a high a sixth cataract country be found to be absolutely deserted peasant dervish being visible having thus accomplished object of reconnaissance flotilla returned exchanged fire with metemmeh battery then kept on way down to berber chapter prisoner rather than remain unoccupied on board gunboat gregory went to colonel wingate headquarters said that must be very glad if must allow while flotilla remained at berber to assist in interrogating fugitive who arrived from south spy employed to gain early information of intention movement of enemy position of dervish at metemmeh be becoming critical khalifa be desirous that mahmud must return with force to omdurman there to take part in battle in a be convinced invader must be annihilated mahmud who be of eager impetuous disposition be anxious to take offensive at once to march upon merawi dongola to drive british out of berber there must be doubt that view be more sagacious one than of father that best tactic to be adopted be to harass british advance fall upon convoy cut communication so oblige to fall back for want of supply khalifa mistake be similar to made by theodore in abyssinia koffee kalkalli in ashanti have of leader adopted system of harassing invader from moment left coast must have be next to impossible for latter to arrive at destination allowed to march on unmolested until within striking distance then hazarded everything on fortune of single battle lost mahmud made movement in obedience to khalifa order to retire to omdurman latter thereupon refused to send further supply to mahmud army be therefore obliged to rely upon raid plunder for subsistence raid be carried out with great boldness village situated within few mile of berber be attacked dervish however met with much warmer reception than have expected for rifle ammunition have be served out freely to villager knowing fate awaited be dervish victorious offered so obstinate resistance that latter fell back discomfited early in january sirdar learned that khalifa have changed mind have sent peremptory order to mahmud to advance drive british out of berber destroy railway mahmud have now be joined by osman digna with five thousand men a egyptian troop well a have fought have never yet be opposed to so formidable force a mahmud commanded sirdar telegraphed to england for white troop request be at once complied with

mahmud remained at metemmeh must aided by fort artillery walled town have offered very formidable resistance have marched along bank of nile must have be exposed to fire of gunboat must not have arrested course country round berber be favourable to action of cavalry if defeated must have fallen back unmolested through metemmeh on omdurman by crossing river practically cut off from dervish base now have only desert behind for have taken over kassala from italian egyptian battalion there large force of friendly arab must prevent from retiring up bank of atbara mahmud plan be to march along nile to ahab then to cross desert to hudi at angle of river whence direct march of twenty five mile must take to berber in way must avoid strong position at junction of atbara nile must have be easy for gunboat to prevent mahmud from crossing nile sirdar be glad to allow to do so movement afforded time to concentrate force to get up large supply for day distance that must be transported by railway have increased saw that when time for fighting came victory must be decisive one that few indeed of mahmud men must ever be able to make way to omdurman swell khalifa force there on one occasion however gunboat went up to watch what be going on take advantage of opportunity might offer to destroy of mahmud boat thus render work of getting force over slower more difficult entrenchment

saved will be grateful gregory have faith whatever in dervish gratitude well zaki said if will not leave will strike at once for shore gunboat be nearly mile away now there be just chance that may not have be noticed by dervish may be able to hide in bush till gunboat return when see will at once send boat ashore under cover of fire take off there be good chance of master zaki said cheerfully dervish be busy up there fighting will not think much of little boat three four minute later be in willow water a soon a landed gregory threw down utterly exhausted woman sank down beside not before hastily rearranging veil in couple of minute gregory roused can climb bank now said sooner be hidden among bush better a spoke heard sound of galloping horseman almost immediately emir on magnificent

be there among bravest of tribe who must have done same have sworn oath mahmud said gloomily have not sworn to slay instantly can keep at least until can take before khalifa say to 'father have sworn to kill unbeliever men have saved fatma life pray to absolve from oath order to be taken from then do pardon set free for service that have rendered ' if refuse if men be killed also swear that a life be due to will perish by own hand if die for saving need not that fatma think that be ungrateful that feel that men have acted nobly thus to risk life to save strange woman whose face have never seen

directing gun against boat said that boat in wife with other woman be crossing have be sunk by shell from battery on other side felt that blood be turned to water said believed that have be killed drowned that looked back a swam saw white man jump overboard short time after followed that when reached shore be supporting woman in water rode hither having small hope indeed that be wife marvelling much that white officer must thus risk life to save drowning woman oath pressed heavily upon a rode even have be slave girl whom rescued must no le have admired courage be said to be brave must never have entered mind thus to risk life for stranger when found that be wife who be saved still more bitterly regretted oath stood between preserver truly glad be that have shown how can escape from consequence now see wonder even more than before at what have done for indeed in year be little more than boy what did emir believe white officer who be good swimmer must have done englishman must see woman drowning without making effort to save if have in power a to fact that be not of same race religion must never give thought must be quite enough for that be woman mahmud said turning to zaki be jaalin be not be jaalin baggara be friend mahmud said placing hand on zaki shoulder so too leapt overboard to save woman emir replied jumped over because master jumped over have not thought about

camel must have enabled to advance have be refused have be ordered to fall back troop have be rendered almost mutinous from want of supply have seen invader growing stronger stronger accomplishing what have seemed impossibility bringing up of store sufficient for sustenance by pushing railroad forward towards berber now that force have be very greatly increased issue of struggle have become doubtful have received order for have be craving for month have be directed to march down attack egyptian army drive across nile destroy railway by mean of spy have heard that ere long large force of british soldier must come up to reinforce egyptian so that what might have be easy work two month before have now become difficult dangerous enterprise manner in dervish have be defeated in attack upon wolseley desert column in engagement have since taken place showed how formidable be fighting power not only of british troop of native army have organized confidence in power of tribesman to sweep before have be shaken dervish scowled when heard that be not to have satisfaction of massacring englishman whose countryman be still keeping up terrible fire on redoubt be not one of wife who have be rescued gregory act of jumping overboard seemed to to savour of madness if plea have be advanced must have recognized a rendering person of man who have performed inviolable however a be under protection of leader harem there be nothing more to be said at order from mahmud four of rode off while others fell in behind mahmud did not mount again walked with wife to deserted mud hut two hundred yard away there left telling gregory zaki to sit down outside placing four men on guard must rejoin men said a mounted when vessel have gone will return hour later fire ceased soon afterwards mahmud rode up with score of men followed by dozen woman slave leading donkey on fatma took seat woman surrounded gregory zaki walked close behind mahmud with horseman rode in front after proceeding for mile came upon group of tent mahmud banner be flying on pole in front of largest of behind touching be almost a large be abode of lady of mahmud harem other tent be occupied by principal emir hundred yard away be encampment of army be sheltered in hastily constructed hut arbour made of bush by mahmud order small tent be erected with blanket close to after entrance into harem tent for

there at daybreak wave white cloth doubtless will send boat ashore thinking that bear message from if see do can swim out to must rather stay with master can not let go too be impossible mahmud said shortly be known throughout camp have white man here news will travel fast to khalifa action have already be misrepresented to be to let officer go father might recall to omdurman send to command here must stay may go without harm can scarcely have be noticed yet can well declare must khalifa hear of that have escaped may speak with master zaki said if say stay will stay though might cost life if say go must go may speak to mahmud said zaki went round to gregory tent told what mahmud have said go certainly zaki can do good by remaining here might even do harm for if be killed also might be murdered moreover wish to send news of capture how occurred think save noticed that be missing when fight be over found that be absent might suppose have be shot have fallen overboard will write note for to carry be in respect better that must go be to be seen talking together might be supposed that be planning way of escape must be more closely watched a be see that mahmud will have difficulty in protecting be to ride about with a say presence must remind follower that have white man captive here whereas if remain almost in concealment near harem fact that there be white man here will pas out of mind of who know will not become common talk of camp mahmud be running risk in having spared life wish to make harder for go therefore tell that will leave tonight can not write now pocketbook be soaked through will tear out leaf dry in sun write have to say before start will speak highly of in letter recommend to colonel wingate who will have doubt give employment hope will see again before long be very sorry that must part be best for very reluctantly zaki returned to mahmud master say must go emir must obey order though must rather stay with tonight will leave be well must must let go also oath prevents from giving freedom trust however that when khalifa hears of noble action how have made debtor will say that allah must not blame for gratitude be even more binding than oath still until hear from can hing have not seen matter in same light for time when wanted to strike be unwilling must do so now when seems to that time for have passed have best retire on omdurman say go forward fight be not for to question command wisdom may not give cause for anger advice to be when get to berber stay there will assuredly be there before long a none must know that be under protection must be slain go straight to abu hamed when hear that have defeated infidel have entered berber leave by road have made upon a tell carriage run without horse stay not until reach cairo there can live quietly until hear that khalifa army be approaching after fly can not say whither seek shelter until black flag wave over whole of land when there be more fighting then come to will give post of honour will do so emir when time come will remind of promise have silver gold with can reward now will gather thing in egypt will make wealthy zaki thought that must be unwise to wander from mahmud encampment accordingly sat down by tent presently one of slave came out with large dish of food that mahmud have sent a evening approached went round to gregory little tent with intention of trying to persuade to attempt to escape with two of tribesman with rifle in hand be stationed there offered opposition to entry presence showed that mahmud be determined that master must appear to be close prisoner a indeed escape might well jeopardize emir position even among follower gregory have letter ready for to carry to captain keppel ran a follows dear captain keppel be prisoner in mahmud hand be result of own impetuosity will not say folly for can not regret that yielded to sudden impulse seized boat containing woman be sunk by shell when few yard astern of gunboat most of occupant be killed saw woman struggling in water without thinking of consequence jumped overboard to save servant following when reached found that current be too strong to regain gunboat so landed about mile down hoping to find shelter in bush until boat came down stream what did however have be observed by dervish a soon a landed party rode up headed by mahmud who be aware that favourite wife be in boat have sunk most fortunately turned out that be woman have saved upon appeal mahmud spared life have released man who will carry to having sworn that must spare white man retains in hand a prisoner until can lay fact before khalifa obtain permission to let go trust that will be well that day may rejoin army however there be saying how matter may turn out be happy in knowing that there be one who if worst come to worst will grieve over loss recommend faithful servant to must wish balance of pay coming to to be handed to a well a camel horse other belonging by sale of must be able at end of war to buy piece of land settle down among own people will kindly report capture to colonel wingate general hunter thanking for kindness to remain yours faithfully gregory hilliard p s in cabin be tin box containing document of importance to will be greatly obliged if will take charge of until a hope will be case rejoin handed paper to zaki who took hand raised to forehead with tear in eye go because order master said in broken voice must thousand time rather remain share fate whatever might be then turned abruptly left tent twice day gregory have received food from female slave of harem although knew that must miss zaki greatly be very glad that have be sent away for felt that although for time have be reprieved position be very precarious that servant must have be still more so white prisoner be personage of consequence death of jaalin be matter must disturb one thousand of have be massacred one more le must not matter at however much dervish might hate white infidel must be serious matter for even most powerful emir to harm prisoner under protection of harem of khalifa son mahmud have be very popular among position have be gravely shaken by event of last six month having unlimited confidence in baggara have seen with increasing fury unopposed advance of egyptian must not understand why must not have be allowed after capture of metemmeh to march across desert to merawi annihilate infidel assembled there be true that have repulsed force defending dongola be comparatively small body be gunboat not egyptian troop who have forced to evacuate town fall of abu hamed have added to discontent be eager to march with speed to berber to join five thousand men comprising garrison to drive invader back across nile have be kept inactive by order of khalifa by want of store have for month be suffering great privation while remaining in enforced inactivity have known that enemy strength be daily increasing that what must have be accomplished with greatest of ease in august have now become very serious business mahmud have chafed at situation in found placed by father refusal to support to allow to take action have soured temper have taken to drinking heavily have become more harsh with men more severe in punishment inflicted for trifling disobedience of order although thought that rule of khalifa must be seriously threatened entered mind fanatical a be must not feel uneasiness at prospect great army be gathering at berber kassala be in hand of british force have be beleaguering have be defeated with heavy loss abyssinia have leagued against insurrection of jaalin have be crushed there be sign of unrest in kordofan other part of course must be put right army of sixty thousand men be at omdurman with mahmud command must suffice to sweep away enemy enthusiasm must never have wavered have be called upon for action month of weary waiting of semi starvation without acquisition of booty plunder for little indeed have be obtained at capture of metemmeh sapped energy force crossed nile for advance upon berber be far le formidable than must have be have be led forward against merawi dongola directly after capture of metemmeh still needed only prospect of battle to restore spirit fortnight after gregory capture dervish army be set in motion few thousand men have already be sent forward along bank of river to check advance might be made from fort atbara have not be for gregory might have attempted to escape must not have be very difficult for to creep out at back of little tent unperceived by guard danger to be encountered in making way to british fort must have be immense must have be necessary for to keep by river for from source alone must water be obtained country have be stripped of crop of kind by dervish village have be razed to ground last head of maize other grain gleaned by starving people who have taken refuge in bush jungle therefore although by keeping near river must quench thirst at will must assuredly have to face starvation moreover must have chance of searching for ear of corn might have escaped eye of searcher for must travel only by night lie up by day to avoid capture by one other of band have gone on in case must at once be killed being beyond influence of mahmud protection of harem on other hand have nothing to complain of except monotony uncertainty of position fatma kept well supplied with food from gossip of slave who brought to learnt how matter be progressing be longing for dervish army to make move for felt that when neared british position greater must be chance of escape none among follower of mahmud rejoiced more than did when knew that long expected advance be about to take place once in motion spirit of dervish revived at last be going to meet insolent invader none doubted that must easily defeat greater portion of harem attendant be left behind at shendy for few camel be available fatma of mahmud wife rode on one tent be carried by half dozen slave followed gregory walked with must not help admiring attitude of tribesman tall powerful men inured to hardship walking riding with air of fierce independence showed pride in confidence in prowess party always started early in morning so a to get tent erected at halting place before main body of dervish came up on march kept distance from river being small group gunboat did not waste shot upon day there be sharp exchange of fire between mahmud force gregory supposed that mahmud plan be to cross atbara be fordable at several point to attack fort there in case have doubt arab must be driven off with much loss sirdar be of same opinion in order to tempt to do so maintained only one egyptian brigade in fort remainder of force being concentrated at kennur four mile away from point must be able to advance take dervish in flank while be engaged in attack of fort mahmud however be kept well informed of movement of troop instead of continuing course down river bank when reached gabati struck across desert after two day march crossed atbara at nakheila from point owing to bend in river must be able to march direct to berber avoiding atbara fort force gathered round altogether desert march although only lasting two day be trying one heat be overpowering even lady of harem have scantiest supply of water have at starting given gregory gourd of water for own use have taken sparingly lasted until reached atbara be now dead low water river offered obstacle to crossing a bed be for most part dry with pool here there arab encampment be formed in thick grove of tree afforded shelter from sun day after day passed mahmud be now informed a to strength of force must have to encounter for first time felt doubt a to issue of fight determined therefore to stand on defensive decision however kept to dervish be burning to be led to assault became almost mutinous on account of delay mahmud be obliged to take strongest measure several of who be loudest in dissatisfaction be summarily executed rest be pacified with assurance that be only waiting for fortunate day in meantime men be employed in fortifying position deep hole be dug along edge of wood behind be trench pitfall mahmud own temper grew daily more sullen fierce own fighting instinct be in favour of attack follower longed to deliver in heart be afraid that result might be fatal be not rifle of infantry that feared of have experience artillery have learned already must be used with terrible effect a mahmud be drinking heavily a fact that white soldier be near at hand added to fanatical hatred of emir tribesman fatma sent message by slave to gregory warning not to show outside little shelter tent composed of single blanket in now lived at length became known that english host be approaching a soon a gunboat brought down news that dervish be no longer following river bank be disappearing into desert sirdar guessed intention nothing must have suited better battle now must be decisive one there be way of retreat open to dervish except to cross waterless desert to fly south keeping to course of atbara must take farther farther from nile with mile marched bringing up force therefore from kennur atbara fort one battalion be left to guard sirdar took up post at position be well chosen lay halfway between mahmud camp at nakheila atbara fort left mahmud only option of attacking of making long detour through desert to east in order to reach berber british on other hand must receive supply by camel from atbara fort cavalry went out to reconnoitre have constant skirmish with enemy horse when day after day passed mahmud did not come a sirdar have expected to attack be determined to take offensive general hunter be ordered to move forward with whole of cavalry maxim gun battery to discover exact position of enemy camp have be well chosen for like abu hamed lay in depression must not be seen until enemy came within six hundred yard of thus superiority of range of british rifle be neutralized gun must not be brought into play until within reach of dervish musket wood be surrounded by high zareba behind crowd of dervish be assembled have anticipated attack held fire until cavalry must come nearer however general hunter have intention of doing retired with information have gained account of strength of position showed difficulty of taking by assault next day again went out with same force time dervish be prepared mounted men dashed out from wood galloped round to cut off cavalry while footman crowded out to attack in front cavalry fell back in perfect order one squadron charged forty of dervish cavalry who barred line of retreat drove off main body still pressed forward maxim opened upon hail of bullet be too much for horseman drew off several time gathered again for charge on occasion maxim dispersed unmounted dervish be soon left behind horseman in spite of lesson have received followed almost to camp on afternoon of th of april anglo egyptian force marched out started at five in afternoon halted at seven horse be first taken down to water infantry by half battalion then lay down to sleep at one o'clock word to advance be passed round quietly moon be full high overhead so there be difficulty in avoiding obstacle brigade marched in square accompanied by gun maxim camel with provision spare ammunition at four o'clock halted again have be well guided be now short distance from enemy position at sunrise men be again on foot advanced to within two hundred yard of position from be to deliver attack british brigade camerons warwick seaforths lincoln be on left next to came macdonald brigade three soudanese regiment in front nd egyptian in support farther still to right touching river be maxwell brigade comprising also three soudanese regiment egyptian one two of three egyptian battalion of lewis brigade be placed on left rear of british brigade third battalion be in square round camel two field battery be in front of infantry two to right of maxwell brigade half mile from zareba infantry halted artillery maxim opened fire for hour tremendous fire be poured into enemy position not shot be fired in reply although dervish must be seen moving among tree apparently unconcerned at storm of shell bullet gregory position have be growing more critical day food be extremely short scanty supply that force have brought with have be long since exhausted be now subsisting upon palm nut of two be served out daily to man quantity barely sufficient to keep life together in spite of vigilant watch kept by more fanatical of mahmud follower desertion have become frequent notwithstanding certain death awaited who be overtaken evening after cavalry made first reconnaissance slave who brought gregory food told that fatma wished to speak to be three pace to entrance of tent guard made objection entrance be closed a slave entered minute later be opened inch two without showing fatma said listen to be listening gregory replied be in great fear for be in much danger emir say to mahmud that ought to be killed follower be well nigh starving why must infidel prisoner be eating friend be now close to there will be battle none will be spared on side why must man be spared have many care men be furious because will not lead out to fight even emir be sullen osman digna who be on bad term with short time ago who mahmud suspect be intriguing with against be foremost in urging that attack must take place though everyone know be coward never show in battle always running away directly see that thing be going against still have five thousand follower of own mahmud told today that have done in power placed a be must not withstand word of emir complaint of tribesman when battle come a must come in day two will need influence faith of men with to win with so much at stake how can risk everything for sake of single life that life of infidel if must agree to aid in working gun a greek egyptian do must content emir can not do gregory said if be to be killed be will of god better that thousand time than turn traitor knew that must be so fatma said sorrowfully what can do at other time protection of harem must cover even one who have slain chief now that baggara be half starving mad with anger disappointment even that no longer avail if must brave anger of son of khalifa must not regard sanctity of harem wish now that have advised to try escape when left shendy even when first came here must have be difficult not impossible now can see chance there be thorn hedge round wood with few opening with men on watch round to prevent desertion several tried to escape last night be caught killed morning even if be possible to pas through there be band of horseman everywhere out on plain keeping watch alike against approach of enemy desertion of coward have be in despair day can not save life of one who saved mine have told mahmud that honour be concerned must give life for yours month ago must have braved anger of army for have changed much of late be not that love le that have be worried beyond bearing in trouble drink until forgets only hope be that people will attack tomorrow mahmud say that will assuredly be beaten will be shot down a approach none will ever be able to get through hedge then when fall back baggara will pour out horse foot destroy will then see how right have be in not letting go out into plain to fight influence will be restored life will be safe be to be removed to farther side of wood when fighting begin there woman be to be gathered till infidel be utterly destroyed if people come tomorrow morning may be saved otherwise fear worst thank for what have done for replied gregory come of be sure that will feel grateful to will not blame for not having be able to do what be impossible hope friend may come tomorrow for fate may be anything be better than uncertainty may allah protect woman said with sob go now hear mahmud calling chapter battle of atbara gregory have little sleep that night be clear to that there be absolutely chance of making escape even be two guard withdrawn must not improve position have mean of disguise even if have arab dress must stain face must not hope to make way through crowd of sleeping men pitfall trench pas out through jealously guarded zareba there be nothing for to wait till end must not blame mahmud leader on eve of great battle must not for sake of single captive risk influence oppose wish of follower be much that have for wife sake postponed fulfilment of oath have so long withstood wish of most influential emir more must not be expected at rate be better off than others who have be in same position have not so far a knew relation in world one who must be anywise affected by death at least must have satisfaction of knowing that be kind action have brought to end prayed earnestly not that life might be spared that death might be painless one that might meet a english officer must without showing sign of fear next day heard order given great stir in camp gathered from who passed near tent that enemy cavalry be again approaching that mounted men be to ride out cut off from retreating while dismounted men be to pour out annihilate then for time be silence in camp suddenly outburst of shout cry broke out almost simultaneously heard rattle of maxim gun fight have begun must egyptian horseman stand firm must give way to panic if broke fled none must return to camp through host of baggara horseman for time roll of fire from machine gun be incessant then there be pause two three minute later broke out again be evidently somewhat farther off so went on with interval of silence ever getting farther away be clear that horseman have not be able to bring cavalry to standstill that be steadily falling back covered by fire of maxim at last sound grew faint in distance soon afterwards noise in camp showed that infantry be returning be not till two hour later that heard mounted men ride in gathered from talk outside that have lost nearly two hundred men have be unable to prevent egyptian cavalry from returning to camp towards evening heard angry talking must distinguish voice then blanket be pulled off support two men ordered to follow be doubtless end nerved for what be to come with head erect steady face accompanied men to front of mahmud tent chief be standing with frowning face several emir be gathered in front of while number of tribesman stood short distance away now mahmud said let one of speak one of emir stepped forward osman digna demand that infidel be put to death countryman have slain many of men yours feeling now that mahmud after doing best have ceased to struggle for that death be certain gregory took step forward towards speaker said scornfully so be osman digna be one of first of countryman to see face though many have seen back at distance instead of provoking pistol shot a have intended remark be followed by roar of laughter from emir for osman cowardice be byword among nickname be one who always run osman indeed have put hand on stock of one of pistol in belt mahmud said imperiously man life be mine not yours osman digna if shoot shoot fearlessness of lad have pleased other emir for recklessly brave baggara appreciated esteemed courage honour one of others said be brave young fellow infidel a people be admit that be brave be for only must say let live until see what come of people complain say folk with whom have quarrel come here aid egyptian against slew many yesterday be not right that man must be living among when countryman be fighting against there be murmur of assent among others then mahmud spoke have promised that must not be killed unless by order of khalifa will do will be placed in front rank if allah will will be killed by bullet of countryman if when fight be over be unharmed will agree that matter be left for khalifa to decide mind wash hand of death on eve of battle be not for to set wish above of emir tribesman yield to demand because be necessary that be of one mind if be killed surely will be unless allah protects blood be upon head waved hand men came forward again took gregory to tent latter be well contented with decision that must be killed have doubt that at least death must be swift sudden must not be speared cut to piece with knife must see countryman advancing must know that must be speedily avenged two day passed when news came that egyptian have advanced to umdabieh seven mile nearer on following morning dervish camp be disturbed early there be joy in face renewed vigour in bearing of men scouting dervish have brought in word that infidel have marched during night be now halting mile half away hour have come at last be confident in trust in leader be renewed fight two day before have shown that gun of white men be terrible on plain that be after wise to await in position have be made impregnable against foe must hurl in vain then be to pour out annihilate

of sheltering from fifteen to twenty men hedge be high one be formed for most part of prickly bush position be indeed formidable one manned a be by nearly twenty thousand desperate fighter at six o'clock first gun be fired for hour half camp be swept with shell shrapnel maxim bullet most of baggara be lying in pit many however walked about calmly a if in contempt of fire more than half of wretched men bound to tree be killed at last fire of gun slackened on crest of position in semicircle round wood long line of steadily marching men appeared assault be about to begin dervish sprang from hiding place lined trench behind zareba troop halted waited maxim moved in front of british brigade then opened fire bugle sounded whole line black white advanced like wall when within three hundred yard men knelt down opened fire in volley of section at same instant dervish with difficulty restrained until now opened fire in return maxim storm of british bullet swept wood filling air with shower of falling leaf gregory murmured prayer shut eye awaited death suddenly felt rope slacken fall from voice said drop on face master almost mechanically obeyed too astonished even to think what be happening then body fell across lie still move master must think be dead be zaki gregory said scarcely able even now to believe that be faithful follower be master have be in camp three day have never have chance of getting near before brave fellow good friend gregory said then be silent speech be almost inaudible amid roar of battle pipe of camerons must however be heard above din men

of british regiment be seated on box round rough table over sort of awning have be erected come join hilliard be having last feast on last store got smuggled up in one of gunboat major called out with pleasure sir officer who be sitting at head of table made room beside men of egyptian army fare good deal better than do think major went on institution of private camel be excellent one did not know that must be allowed after be not bad thing that did not have for there be doubt be a well that soldier must not see faring better than there be bother enough with baggage a be of course be different in case there be only two three white officer with battalion must not strike black troop a hardship that must have different food from be living a well a better than ever did in life three camel make material addition to baggage train while a there be thirty forty of must make serious item in ours general keen eye must spot at once camel be burden to army gregory said only have few pound of grain day get living principally on what can pick up when go on now will carry fifty pound of private grain get five pound when there be bush grass so that grain will last for fortnight suppose think that dervish mean fighting think there be doubt about fugitive come in say that khalifa will fight whether will be in defence of omdurman whether will come out attack at kerreri none can say khalifa keep intention to by bye hilliard think know right hand neighbour only joined hour before started having be left behind at cairo sick mr hartley let introduce to mr hilliard must say bimbashi hilliard be on general hunter staff young lieutenant placed eyeglass in eye bowed to gregory have be in beastly country long asked if include lower egypt have be here eighteen year dear other drawled climate seems to have agreed with fairly well gregory replied mind heat much one doe feel while one be at work hartley have not tried that yet one of others laughed work be not in line most unfortunate illness of kept back at cairo brought supply of ice with when came up that be able to hand over hundredweight of to when arrived think major that in introducing must have omitted to mention for temporary misfortune must be marquis of langdale in two year will blossom out into full title then suppose will lose gregory whose knowledge of english peerage be extremely limited looked puzzled may ask how be said always thought that next heir to title succeeded to a soon a father died a rule be case major said present be exceptional one at death of late marquis heir to title be missing may say that late marquis only enjoyed title for two year next of kin brother of have disappeared up to present news have be obtained of of course have be advertised for so on without success be known that married a did so against wish of father broke off communication with family be generally supposed that emigrated pending news of title be held in abeyance may have died be probable that have done so for must hardly have escaped seeing advertisement be inserted in paper of course if have left child inherit title after lapse of five year mr hartley father who be next heir who died five year ago applied to be declared inheritor of title peer judge someone decided that twenty one year must elapse before such application must be even considered income have be accumulating ever since so that at end of time be probable that mr hartley will be allowed to assume title will estate go with title hartley oh must say so of course other drawled title must not be of much use without nonsense dear fellow said why fellow with personal advantage title must be able to command american market to pick up heiress with million general laugh followed showed that hartley be by mean popular character in regiment fellow be consummate as man on gregory left whispered only got into service a queen cadet must no more have got in by mark than must have flown one belief that have anything matter with at cairo preferred stopping behind coming up by without duty to taking share in work be always talking about earldom be why major mentioned so a to draw out suppose be really heir to yes if one else claim for aught be known there may be dozen child of man be missing knocking about somewhere in canada australia if so be safe to turn up sooner later see a man have elder brother must not have counted at upon coming to title may be in out of way place where even colonial newspaper must never reach sooner later of son will be coming home will hear of last earl death then fellow nose will be put out of joint be sure everyone in regiment must be glad for be insufferable as suppose when come into title will cut army altogether exchange into guard party presently broke up having finished last bottle of wine have brought up gregory remained seated by major discussing chance of campaign point where resistance might be expected other officer stood talking short distance off presently gregory caught word how be that young fellow call bimbashi believe mean major doe not call that although be rank white officer in egyptian army have rank though may only be lieutenant in call monstrous thing drawling voice then said that young fellow like who seems to be egyptian by birth must have higher rank than men here who have served fifteen twenty year major got up walked across to group will tell why mr hartley said in loud voice be because for purpose of war in country know infinitely more than officer of army talk language know men black will follow anywhere to death a for mr hilliard have performed feat that officer in army rank must be proud to have done went in disguise into dervish camp at metemmeh before hunter advance began obtained invaluable information jumped overboard from gunboat to save drowning dervish woman although to do so involved almost certain capture death at hand of dervish in point of fact escape be remarkable one for be tied to tree in first line of dervish defence at atbara be only saved by what be almost miracle may not be heir to earldom mr hartley must do more credit to title than many must name hear well spoken of by everyone a indefatigable worker a having performed most valuable service captain keppel on whose gunboat served for two three month spoke to of in highest term general hunter have done same fancy sir that will be year before be likely to distinguish so highly father be officer who fell in battle if happened to be born in egypt a sneeringly said just now can say be that in opinion have be born in egypt must not occupy position now doe gregory have walked away when major rose did not return to party be first time that have run across bad specimen of british officer word have stung a said to need not mind a fellow own comrade regarded a one of said a insufferable as still must not help wishing to that missing heir might turn up in time to disappoint general hunter started next day at noon with two of

got into hold on board have just time to scramble into boat swim to shore life be lost though there be many narrow escape among be commander keppel prince christian victor who be on board fortunately steamer soon came along took gyasses with ship wrecked officer crew on board towed up to el hejir have be intended to stay here little time nile continued to rise to altogether exceptional height part of camp be flooded at five o'clock therefore egyptian brigade started with gun on right steamer covering left while cavalry camel corp be spread widely out in advance to give notice of approaching dervish force a usual soldier wife turned out a battalion marched past shouted encouragement to husband calling upon to behave like men not to turn back in battle presence of woman have excellent effect on soldier in addition to assistance in carrying effect cooked ration looked after generally sirdar therefore did not discourage presence in field even supplied with ration when be impossible for to obtain elsewhere in afternoon two white brigade also moved forward at nine o'clock arrived at camping ground whole army be again collected together next morning four squadron of egyptian horse with portion of cavalry went forward to reconnoitre one of gunboat proceeded few mile up river saw anything of enemy there have be heavy rain during night have ceased at daybreak strong wind speedily dried sand raising such cloud of dust that be difficult to see above few yard storm have also effect of hindering flotilla on other side of river stuart wortley friendly have sharp brush with dervish whom have come upon raiding village whose inhabitant have not obeyed khalifa order to move into omdurman a rainstorm continued be decided by council of war that health of troop must suffer by longer stay on th therefore army set out in order of battle ready to encounter khalifa attack arrived without molestation at um teref short distance from kerreri where be expected enemy must give battle camp be smaller than hitherto made be protected by strong zareba sentry be doubled patrol thrown out heavy rain set in after sunset almost deluge poured down tent have be left behind a little blanket shelter be soon soaked through occupant be speedily wet to skin be still raining when at past five force again started a before army be marching in fighting order day be cool cloudy at one o'clock halted at village called merreh seg cavalry have come into touch with dervish patrol latter although numerous avoided combat in one of deserted village be found one of wingate spy in dervish attire have left omdurman thirty hour before brought news that khalifa intended to attack at kerreri place have be chosen because there be current old prophecy by persian sheik to effect that english soldier must one day fight at kerreri be destroyed there have therefore become almost holy place to mahdist be called death place of infidel once year khalifa follower made pilgrimage to few shot be fired during night fire blazed on hill to notify to omdurman precise position troop started again soon after daylight facing now to right marching westward to leave bush broken ground get out in open desert stretching away to omdurman cavalry be widely spread out lancer ascended to top of hill of el teb from view of dervish camp be obtained lay ten mile due south dervish be disposed in three long line stretching from within two thousand yard of nile out into desert being careful to get a believed beyond range of four gunboat steamed quietly up after short march force halted near river two mile north of kerreri place be convenient for camping bank of river be steep there be much difficulty in watering horse transport animal be in for bad night one of general staff said to gregory a evening approached look like cloud be banking up fast if rain must come in daytime instead of at night one must not object to much must lay dust cool air besides on march have other thing to think of though of course must be drenched to skin must not mind be very unpleasant lying in pool of water with stream running in at one neck a to one blanket be like sponge five minute after rain begin officer said be better off in respect gregory remarked for when left little tent behind kept waterproof sheet instead of second blanket have intended to use tent fashion be blown down in minute after first storm burst now stand up wrap blanket tightly round while boy doe same with waterproof sheet keep moderately dry except that water will trickle in at end near neck on other hand wrapping keep so hot might almost a well lie uncovered in rain staff have intended taking few tent with be practically of use at a canvas have to be lowered by time light out sounded after hour loud talking be permitted in camp might have be privation have weather be fine even most joyous spirit have little desire for conversation when rain be falling in bucketful over officer of white division lay down by men in position must occupy if attack by enemy took place officer of egyptian regiment lay together just in rear of men a soon a last post sounded absolute silence reigned sentry placed very short distance out kept sens of sight hearing on alert with eye ear strove to detect approach of lurking foe jaalin scout be stationed outside zareba so a to give early warning of approach of enemy reliance must be placed upon for altogether without discipline must probably creep under bush endeavour to find shelter from pitiless downpour have khalifa known business must have taken advantage of tempestuous night launched warrior at camp confident a officer of expedition be in ability of men to repulse assault might be made in daylight be felt that attack must cause terrible loss possibly grave disaster if delivered at night enemy might not be discovered until within few yard of camp swish of rain almost incessant crash of thunder must deaden sound of approach long before troop must leap to foot prepare to receive calmly dervish must be upon a latter be enormously stronger in number advantage of superior weapon must be lost in hand to hand fight in inevitable confusion a troop in reserve must be unable to open fire while ignorant of precise position of friend foe khalifa however be relying upon prophecy be at kerreri that infidel army be to be utterly destroyed may have thought that must be tempting fate be to precipitate action before invader reached spot where doom have be pronounced even more miserable than night be hour before dawn lying still drenched to skin a be nature prevailed men obtained sleep when rose to foot threw off sodden blanket felt full misery of eight hour drenching be cold now a well a wet a endeavoured to squeeze water from clothes to restore circulation by swinging arm few word be spoken rising of sun be regarded a terrible infliction during day be eagerly looked for sooner did appear above horizon than spirit of men rose rapidly laughed joked made light of inconvenience of situation hour later clothes be nearly dry by time be well on way brigade a before marching in echelon wauchope brigade on left lyttleton farther to right more to rear three egyptian brigade farther out on plain st lancer scouting ground in front of british division native cavalry camel corp out beyond right of egyptian expected that at least must have skirmish before reached kerreri where be to encamp a advanced be found that dervish have fallen back from line have joined khalifa main force near omdurman by ten in morning army have arrived at camping place be in southern part of ground occupied by straggling village a usual extremity of line rested on nile forming semicircle in baggage animal store be placed in charge of collinson brigade gunboat took up position to cover ground over enemy must approach to attack while infantry be settling down cavalry camel corp went out scouting signaller soon mounted rugged hill named surgham from here fine view be obtained of omdurman khalifa army omdurman be six mile away covering wide tract of ground with few building rising above general level one conspicuous object being great tomb of mahdi with white dome in outskirt of town be white tent of dervish army for present be unoccupied whole force being drawn up in regular line out on plain about halfway between town surgham hill be formed in five division of be bright with banner of colour size shape khalifa own division be in centre where great black banner waving from lofty flagstaff must be plainly made out lancer egyptian cavalry camel corp continued to advance capturing several party of footman principally jaalins who probably lagged purposely behind retiring dervish in order to be taken at time cavalry attempted to charge dervish horseman when approached in case did latter await attack presently above occasional musketry fire came boom of heavy gun there be thrill of excitement in camp gunboat have arrived opposite omdurman have opened fire upon dervish riverside fort be strongly constructed a in fort at metemmeh shabluka embrasure be so faultily constructed that gun must only be brought to bear upon portion of river directly facing four gunboat passed without receiving material damage be so able to maintain bombardment without receiving fire in return at same time landed forty pounder gun on island short distance from town thence opened fire with lyddite shell upon howitzer be trained upon mahdi tomb soon great hole be knocked in dome must be seen from top of hill that caused great excitement in dervish line number of horseman rode out against lancer drove in advance scout on main body of regiment moving forward fell back to line almost immediately heavy body of infantry moved out intention evidently being to surround cut off regiment while at same time general advance took place colonel of lancer dismounted portion of men checked advance of enemy until rest fell back news of advance be signalled to general kitchener whole force at once took position in fighting order believing that general attack on camp must now be made cavalry fell back on flank so a to clear way for fire of artillery infantry dervish have good view of camp from top of surgham khalifa apparently considered that be too late in day for general attack drew off men to former position rest of afternoon evening passed quietly a men ate meal of tinned meat biscuit be in higher spirit than have be since advance began hitherto have be in constant apprehension lest dervish must shun battle must retire across desert to el obeid elsewhere that must have to perform interminable desert march only to find on arriving at goal that enemy have again moved off event of day however seemed to show that fear be groundless that khalifa have determined to fight decisive battle for defence of capital british soldier be ready to support fatigue hardship with prospect of fight at end during advance be always haunted by fear that enemy will retire give in on approach fear be stronger than usual on expedition for there be question a to greatly superior mobility of dervish be evident that if chose to avoid fighting have in power to do so chapter omdurman night passed quietly except shot be occasionally fired by dervish who crept up within range once mounted man who have apparently lost way rode fearlessly into camp then finding close to troop turned horse galloped off again shot followed a order be strict that camp be not to be alarmed unless in case of serious attack at half past three bugle sounded troop be soon astir animal be watered fed men have breakfast of cocoa tea with biscuit tinned meat at past four colonel broadwood commanding egyptian cavalry sent out squadron to hill on west to surgham hill latter arrived at destination at two minute past five when daylight have just broken officer in command saw at once that dervish army have be reinforced in night be marching to attack news be at once sent back to camp where be in readiness for advance news must have be more welcome be one thing to attack dervish in chosen position to carry narrow street of omdurman at point of bayonet dervish have shown at abu hamed how desperately must fight under such circumstance to meet while attacking position in open be protected along line occupied by white troop by hedge while three egyptian brigade have constructed shelter trench afforded vastly better defence against foe advancing by daylight although must not be so effective in checking sudden determined rush in darkness preparation be at once made to oppose enemy sirdar staff be already mounting when news arrived horse be now taken to rear reserve ammunition box lifted from mule back animal led to sheltered position behind hut gun be wheeled up into position between infantry brigade troop be disposed in line two deep two company of battalion with stretcher bearer taking post at short distance farther back to reinforce front line if hardly pressed to supply from reserve store of ammunition already gunboat have recommenced bombardment of omdurman mosque of mahdi a soon a news came that dervish be advancing to attack be signalled to return to cover flank of zareba on arrival took up position whence must shell line by dervish be advancing must bring apparently five six hundred yard west of surgham hill lancer at once started forward to cover left flank of position in few minute reached surgham hill joined egyptian squadron there sight from crest of surgham hill be grand enemy front extended over three mile line be deep compact banner floated above be advancing steadily in good order battle cry rose fell in measured cadence number be variously estimated at from fifty to seventy thousand superb force consisting of men a brave a in world animated by religious fanaticism intense hatred of be marching to assail in centre be khalifa own corp twenty thousand strong on right be banner of yacoub brother beyond two

dervish retired into zareba when latter came near enough to see small british force shout of exultation rose from rank for felt certain now of surrounding annihilating infidel according to prophecy on side satisfaction be le marked front line moved forward to thorny hedge prepared to open fire above black troop uttered joyful shout of defiance a took place in trench when enemy be two thousand eight hundred yard away three battery on left of zareba opened fire two battery on right number of maxim joined in pouring shell bullet into thickest of dervish mass round khalifa banner effect be terrible for moment dervish line halted astonished at storm to be exposed be only for moment wide gap be filled up at quicker pace than before great line swept on banner bearer baggara horseman pushing forward to front to encourage infantry seeing how persistently be coming on sirdar ordered men of lyttleton brigade to open fire at long range grenadier be first to begin firing volley in section other regiment of brigade be soon hard at maxim appeared to be doing serious execution while terrible effect of shell fire must really be seen although great number of enemy be killed wounded by bursting shell there be halt in forward movement suddenly over crest side of surgham hill division of dervish right reinforced by portion of yacoub division appeared over fifteen thousand men came streaming down hill waving banner shouting war cry be led by emir on horseback infantry kept pace with occasionally discharging rifle at random gun of three battery one of maxim be swung round opened upon be le than mile away whole of gatacre division opened terrific fire still dervish held on leaving ground passed over white with fallen men from seventeen hundred yard sight have to be lowered rapidly at thousand yard held foe man must cross ground swept by hail of ball so rapid sustained be fire that men have to retire to refill pouch from reserve ammunition rifle be so heated that must no longer be held in case men changed weapon for of company in reserve in others company closed up took place of front line not for moment be there cessation in fire unable to do more yacoub men moved towards front joined main body whose advance have be checked by fire of maxwell egyptian brigade few round have be fired by three cannon that khalifa have brought out with fell short on side casualty have be few in desperate attempt to get at close quarter dervish rifleman have not stopped to reload weapon have discharged there be practically return to awful fire to have be exposed while be force have be terribly punished main body brought to standstill at distance of fourteen hundred yard have suffered almost a heavily battle have not gone so well to right of position towards khalifa be now moving broadwood horse camel corp have be driven off hill occupied so fierce be attack that three of gun of horse battery have to be left behind camel corp be ordered to retire rapidly make for shelter to right rear of camp force made two three stand egyptian cavalry more than once charged pursuing horseman gunboat opened fire covered final retirement of camel corp have lost eighty men cavalry did not retire to zareba continued to fall back occasionally turning facing enemy until be five mile away when dervish gave up pursuit sat down to rest after tremendous exertion although forced to retire cavalry have done good service for have drawn off great body of enemy at critical moment be unable to return take part in battle still raging at khalifa moved off with force behind western hill for short time there be lull in battle many of wounded tribesman crawled up to within seven eight hundred yard of zareba there opened fire aim be good men began to drop fast in spite of volley fired to clear off troublesome foe fire be soon disregarded for from ravine in range of low hill behind khalifa force have disappeared mass of men burst out at hard run from shelter behind surgham hill portion of force who be there also swept down to join khalifa while yacoub advanced from southwest body from west instantly infantry artillery fire broke out again on previous day distance have be measured marked on several conspicuous object storm of shell tore rank of enemy rifle swept with rain of bullet in face of dervish continued to advance at run number thinning minute two three hundred horseman with emir dashed at zareba at full gallop shrapnel maxim rifle bullet swept rank nearer nearer came with lessening number yard until last of fell within about two hundred yard of maxwell line animated by example infantry rushed forward black flag be planted within nine hundred yard of maxwell left in addition to egyptian fire crossfire of british division poured upon around main body began to waver khalifa emir did best to encourage rally flag be riddled with ball men who held be shot down others seized post of honour until pile of body accumulated round at last one man remained standing there for minute stood quietly immovable then fell forward dead then dervish lost heart began to fall back in one two then in dozen until last have disappeared behind hill troop then turned attention to men who lying in shelter be still maintaining fire there be fully thousand of greater portion of casualty took place from fire while troop be occupied in repelling main attack be not long however before bullet shell proved too much for who survived crawled away to join kinsman behind hill be eight o'clock now victory have apparently be won ten thousand of khalifa best troop have be killed wounded in british division one officer one man have be killed three officer sixty five men wounded latter be at once placed on board hospital barge fresh ammunition be served out hour after last shot be fired army prepared to march on omdurman be most important that must arrive at town before ed din dervish must reach for unless must do so loss must be incurred in capturing must be vastly greater than have be suffered in battle at nine o'clock start be made troop advanced in brigade lyttleton led on left wauchope be on right maxwell somewhat in rear while still more to right came lewis out on plain macdonald formed roughly semicircle lyttleton followed by wauchope be to march between river surgham hill maxwell be to cross over hill while lewis macdonald be to keep out to right collinson egyptian brigade be to guard store material left behind st lancer scouted ahead of british brigade to discover if foe be lurking behind surgham hill when about mile south of hill saw small party of dervish cavalry infantry who be hiding in what looked like willow water course four squadron rode forward at gallop sharp musketry fire opened upon without hesitation dashed headlong at dervish when found that instead of hundred fifty foeman a have supposed fifteen hundred dervish be lying concealed in water course be too late to draw rein with cheer cavalry rode down into midst of foe there be wild fierce fight lance against spear sabre against sword butt end of rifle deadly knife cut way through unscathed others be surrounded cut off splendid feat of heroism be performed many of who got over returned to rescue officer comrade until at last survivor climbed bank brunt of fighting fell upon two central squadron not only be enemy thickest where charged opposite bank of deep nullah be composed of rough boulder almost impassable by horse squadron lost sixteen killed nineteen wounded altogether twenty two officer men be killed fifty wounded there be one hundred nineteen casualty among horse once across survivor gathered at point where fire commanded water course dismounting speedily drove dervish from on examining afterwards be found that sixty dead dervish lay where central squadron have cut way through charge in daring heroism resembled that of rd light dragoon at talavera fall into ravine on occasion be much deeper than into lancer dashed be not occupied by desperate force although many be injured by fall be in subsequent charge against whole french division that be almost annihilated incident be like balaclava charge magnificent be not war desperate charge to cover retreat of defeated army be legitimate worthy of praise even if gallant men who make be annihilated be not case at talavera at omdurman be brilliant costly mistake bravery shown be superb manner in officer men rode back into struggling mass to rescue comrade beyond praise charge must never have be made life be uselessly sacrificed a yet be quiet at other point body of enemy must be seen making way towards omdurman battery opposite town have from early morning be keeping up fire from heavy gun upon save for occasional shot of lurking dervish be quiet elsewhere while cavalry charge be in progress gregory have moved along line of egyptian brigade with general hunter suddenly from behind hill where khalifa have fallen back with defeated army column of fully twelve thousand men led by banner bearer emir poured out again strong body sprang forward from valley made for southeastern corner of macdonald brigade have moved almost due west from position have occupied in zareba while large force have chased away egyptian cavalry be seen returning to attack in rear general hunter who be riding between macdonald lewis brigade be now good mile apart exclaimed to gregory who happened to be nearest officer to ride to macdonald tell to fall back if possible then turned galloped off to fetch up reinforcement need be already seen sudden uproar have attracted attention of whole army sirdar instantly grasped situation moment be indeed critical if macdonald brigade be overwhelmed might have meant general disaster sirdar at once sent order to wauchope brigade to go at double to macdonald aid fortunately colonel long who commanded artillery have sent three battery with macdonald brigade collinson brigade be far away near river lewis be threatened be evident at once that assistance must reach macdonald in time when gregory reached dervish be already approaching can not be done macdonald said sternly when gregory delivered message must fight indeed to retreat must have meant destruction fire must have be ineffective thirty thousand fierce foe must have be among there be nothing to do to fight macdonald have marched out with th soudanese on left nd egyptian in centre th soudanese on right in line behind in column be th soudanese last be at once brought up into line to face advancing enemy fortunately sheik ed din force be still little distance away battery took

a be custom individually a fast a must load egyptian battalion by steady volley still enemy pressed on until be within two hundred yard of line emir other leader baggara horse many spearmen still held on until fell few foot only from steady infantry rear rank of dervish now began to fall back desperate charge of leader grew feebler ed din division be now within thousand yard macdonald confident that main attack be broken threw back th soudanese to face wheeled couple of battery to support already retreating dervish encouraged by arrival of ed din division returned to attack th soudanese swung round to aid th in struggle with ed din troop charge of dervish be impetuous in extreme regardless of storm of shell bullet rushed on must have thrust between th th have not nd egyptian wheeling at double thrown into gap dervish pressed right up to bayonet spear frequently crossed in fight of kind discipline tell tale black egyptian maintained line steadily firmly against individual effort courage even of highest quality be in vain ground being now cleared gunboat opened with maxim cannon upon rear of dervish camel corp coming up man dismounted added fire to turmoil finally three of wauchope battalion arrived lincoln doubling to right opened terrible flank fire dervish broke fled not a usual sullenly reluctantly at full speed stooping low to escape storm of bullet pursued zaki have throughout day kept close to gregory ready to hold horse when dismounted quick footed a be be left behind when master galloped across to macdonald be up however in course of minute two gregory be glad to see for horse be kicking plunging at roar of approaching enemy be almost maddened when to be added crash of battery musketry put blanket round head zaki gregory said when black ran up wrap round so that can not see hold bridle with one hand stroke with other keep on talking to know voice want to dismount if can help for with field glass see everything be taking place will tell how matter be going for moment seemed a if surging crowd streaming down must carry before steadiness with th soudanese moved into place on flank of line other regiment remained a if on parade soon reassured terrible slaughter be taking place in rank of dervish soon showed that in quarter at least there be fear of thing going wrong must not look anxiously towards great mass of men approaching from north be matter of minute must present attack be repulsed in time for position to be changed to meet coming storm occasionally gregory looked back to see if reinforcement be coming wauchope brigade be visible over top of scattered bush movement of line showed that be coming on at double be farther away than ed din host latter be running like deer felt deep sense of relief when th soudanese be thrown back performing movement a quietly steadily a if on drill ground two battery of artillery galloped across to support have hardly expected such calm courage from black battalion a to bravery of soudanese troop there be question be of same blood race a foe have shown how bravely must fight in many previous battle be not prepared for steady way in worked under such novel circumstance although too must have known that moment be of consequence moved without haste hurry into new position scarcely glancing at torrent be rushing on towards not le steadily quietly did th considered to be crack regiment of brigade swing round a calmly firmly did egyptian battalion composed of peasant who twenty year before have be considered among most cowardly of people host of whom must have fled before dozen of dreaded dervish march into gap between two black regiment manfully hold own yet must not feel sorry for valiant savage who under so awful fire still pressed forward to certain death number withering away at step until dwindled to nothing only to be replaced by fresh band darted forward to meet similar fate yet when remembered wholesale slaughter at annihilation of countless village of inhabitant above absolute destruction of army of hick pasha capture of khartoum murder of gordon reduction to state of slavery of peaceful tribe of soudan must not feel that annihilation of human tiger wiping out of false creed be necessity when last shot be fired dismounted leant against horse completely unnerved by tremendous excitement have be compressed into space of

forehead heart murmured thanks thank said be small part of debt that owe brother know whether have told that saved life at risk of own have be thinking lord zaki said that must be well for to go down in boat a far a dongola village be not many mile from place many of people fled there doubtless will return to village plant field now that have longer fear of dervish at rate be certain to meet friend at dongola very well will get order altered there will be difficulty about will be very glad to know that will have home to go to when war be quite over will never go a long a lord will keep zaki said fervently certainly will not part with zaki a long a remain in country will probably be for long time next day zaki aided in carrying sister good down to river bank saw on board one of native craft carried also fifteen twenty other fugitive now mr hilliard general hunter said that morning can devote to object for came here unquestionably there must be many among prisoner who fought at el obeid may gather particular of battle from lip greater portion of white troop will march down country at once of course know what plan may be unless have very good reason to contrary must certainly advise to retain position in egyptian army great deal of work will have to be done before matter be quite settled down then civil administration of sort will of course be formed under must certainly obtain far better post than must hope to get at home have quite made up mind to do so sir certainly when left cairo have idea of remaining permanently in service have be so exceptionally fortunate owing largely to kindness have be seriously thinking matter over be quite determined that if can obtain appointment will remain here have tie either in lower egypt in england way of earning living there possibly a have begun so early may rest in time in what will doubt become important branch of egyptian administration be glad to hear that take view grumble at soudan yet there be few of must be sorry to leave there can be doubt whatever under administration will in time become magnificently rich fertile province being relieved from other duty at present gregory went to great yard near mosque called praying square where majority of dervish prisoner be confined addressing man of five forty year asked in arabic whether many among prisoner have fought against hick at el obeid man hesitated be not asking on part of sirdar gregory said may be sure that if punishment be inflicted against who have fought against now there can be thought of punishment for thing happened so many year ago father be believe one of english officer killed there a spoke arabic well be just possible be not killed like slatin neufeld be kept a slave in case might be useful there be many here who fought against hick native said fought there nearly baggara who be a old a be be there also have never heard of white man who escaped death when broke into square english general officer charged into middle of fell be not close at time saw body hour afterwards father be not fighting officer be interpreter may not have be near others when attack by people be made have heard that one of soudanese regiment held together marched away that there be white officer with be so two day afterwards surrounded fought hard at last when have lost many men offered that if must surrender become mahdi men must be spared most of did so just a of tribesman taken by at atbara have now taken service with white officer what became of can not say native said have memory of may have fallen before surrendered who can say certainly remember white man being killed after did so will ask others who be there tomorrow will tell what say be busy day in omdurman army have made such effort achieved so great triumph marched in military order with band playing through town sirdar have double motive in ordering to do so in first place be legitimate triumph of troop thus to march a conqueror through town in second place sight must impress not only inhabitant dervish prisoner with sense of power of who henceforth must be master undoubtedly show have desired effect orderly rank a swept along proud demeanour of men physique equipment created profound impression among native half of be own kinsman many of whom have fought for khalifa have now aided in defeating be what have be accomplished by drill discipline influence of white officer soudanese be evidently well fed cared for not even haughty baggara held head so high especially admired be artillery battery following battery in perfect order be gun have carried death into rank of dervish against whose fire even fanatical bravery of follower of khalifa be unable to stand when march past be concluded there be scarce one of prisoner who must not gladly have enlisted on following day gregory again went to praying square man have morning before seen at once came up to have enquired of many who be at el obeid lord said say that there be white man in camp when black battalion surrendered though one have be seen while fighting be going on be body of one found where fight have taken place on previous day be matter of talk among dervish at time for have lain in circle round enemy be convinced that one passed through line who surrendered said that have taken command have exposed to hottest fire encouraged telling that more bravely defended more likely be to obtain favourable term night before have advised to accept offer dervish might make on following morning be missing none must give account of what have become of same tale be told by to whom have spoken story made profound impression upon gregory seemed possible that father of whom have remembrance might have be sole white survivor of hick army true there be nothing to prove that be white man who have joined black battalion escaped first day massacre there be other non combatant vizitelly artist of illustrated london news o'donovan correspondent of daily news either of might also have be at other portion of square when attack commenced unable to join hick officer in final charge into midst of enemy still be at least possible that father be man who have retired from field with black battalion who have afterwards so strangely disappeared if so what have become of year have made off in disguise only to be murdered by wandering band have be concealed for month in hut of friendly tribesman what have be doing since have be killed in trying to make way down have be enslaved be still lingering on in wretched existence must hardly hope that have fallen into friendly hand for have be alive must surely have managed with knowledge of country to make way down to reach khartoum when be still held by egyptian at rate gregory concluded that might find out whether european have arrived there during siege went down to river took native boat across to khartoum at ceremony on sunday many native watched arrival of flotilla of might have be there in gordon time have great hope of there be just chance flag be still flying over governor house when landed detachment of egyptian troop be stationed there native officer came down when landed have come across to question of native said believe be still living here oh yes bimbashi there be good many scattered about among ruin come in bringing fruit fish for sale think mostly live down by riverside gregory kept on till came to hut occupied by fisherman men who cultivated small plot of ground found several who have lived at khartoum when be captured who have escaped general massacre by hiding till then making way up river in boat none of must give information sought one suggested that be more likely to hear from greek turk who worked in khalifa arsenal foundry a have be spared for service must be able to render to mahdi returning to omdurman went to machine shop here work have already be resumed a repair be needed by several of gunboat went up to foreman man of sixty year of age be engaged in city during siege be not said in arabic with knew foreman must be thoroughly acquainted yes sir have be here ten year before be very anxious to learn whether white man who have survived battle of el obeid ever reached town before capture man thought for time said white man certainly came here towards end of siege know because happened to meet when be going home from work asked way to governor must not have known to be white man for have native attire be a black from exposure to sun a of arab gave direction did not ask question be said afterwards that be one of hick officer later heard that went down in steamer with colonel stewart did not hear name gregory asked anxiously sir did talk arabic well extremely well much better than did at time do remember how long arrived before steamer started not very long sir though really can not tell how long be after be cut off suppose certainly be can not say how long one else here must know more about than do sir must think not can ask called up of other workman knew that white officer of hick pasha army be said to have returned one of remembered that have come down once with gordon to see about repair required to engine of steamer have never heard name must recall personal appearance except that seemed to be man about thirty remembered once seeing again on board stewart steamer a have be working at engine just before started after thanking foreman gregory returned to hut where two other officer of hunter staff have taken up quarter be profoundly depressed white man might well have be father if so be even more certain than before that have fallen knew what have be fate of stewart steamer remains of have seen at colonel with have accepted invitation of treacherous sheik of village have be massacred must at least go there endeavour to learn from of native particular of fate of on board whether be possible that of white must have escaped after sitting for time in thought went to general hunter quarter asked to see general listened sympathetically to story never for moment thought that father must have escaped said from what tell be possible that did so only to perish afterwards can well understand how having learnt so much must be anxious to hear more certainly will grant request for leave to go down to hebbeh a know that place be taken destroyed by river column under earle rather under brackenbury for earle have be killed in fight at kirkeban numerous relic be found of massacre journal stewart be known to have kept be not among have be there must no doubt have mentioned survivor of hick army who be coming down river with place be deserted when brackenbury arrived certainly be so when came up since then of inhabitant have probably returned may know of place where plunder be hidden away on approach of brackenbury column doubt offer of reward must lead to production may not have to be absent long british regiment be to go down at once several steamer will start tomorrow will give order to go with will have difficulty in getting back for sirdar have already decided that railway be to be carried on at once from atbara to khartoum have believe telegraphed morning that material store be to be sent up at once most of will doubt be brought on by rail grain of large quantity will be required for use of troop of population of town will come on by water doubt quickest way back will be to ride to abu hamed take train up to atbara will be back a soon a can general be much obliged to for letting go will tell sirdar have given leave why be not absolutely necessary be always well that one name must be kept to front next day gregory saw general again mentioned to sirdar that wanted fortnight leave told why simply nodded said 'let have month if want ' have other thing to think of for morning small dervish steamer came down white nile have khalifa flag flying have not heard of what have taken place till one of gunboat ran alongside of course surrendered at once be curious story told left omdurman month ago with sapphire carried five hundred men object of voyage be to collect grain when reached old station of fashoda have be fired upon by black troop with white men among who have strange flag flying firing be pretty accurate for have forty men killed wounded emir in command have disembarked encamped troop from sapphire on opposite bank have sent small steamer back to ask khalifa for order story seemed so strange improbable went down with sirdar to boat have be brought alongside there be doubt that have be peppered with ball of general staff cut one of bullet out of woodwork fully confirmed story be not leaden ball bit of old iron conical nickel bullet must only have be fired from small bore rifle so there be certainly white men at fashoda of course one can form opinion a to who be where come from may be belgian from congo may be most improbable be expeditionary party of italian italy be withdrawing not pushing forward so think be out of question that be concerned in matter question seems to lie between belgian french unless expedition have be sent up from possession on great lake dervish in steamer can only say that flag be not at like ours a ignorance of colour be profound give sort of contradictory statement anyhow be serious matter certainly foreign power have right to send expedition to nile a certainly if one of did so government must not allow to remain there for beyond question fashoda be egyptian station within egyptian territory be at present a much a to say that foreign power established there must be occupying country seems extraordinary proceeding sir very extraordinary if be not that seems thing have absolutely be done must seem improbable that foreign power must take such extraordinary unjustifiable course be lucky for whoever be that have smashed up dervish for must have made very short work of nation sent must probably never have known fate chapter voice from dead afternoon gregory heard that order have be issued for five of gunboat to start up river first thing in morning that sirdar be going be to take up five hundred men of th soudanese order be also issued that correspondent be to leave next day for cairo gregory have met one of that evening so be off hear mr pearson yes did have sort of option given be really choice at might go down instantly must stay till last of white troop have gone down may be very long time a there be saying what may come of fashoda business besides khalifa have fairly escaped if out of sixty thousand men with thirty thousand got off may yet rally round in two three month may be at head of a large force a ever think after way egyptian fought other day there will be need for white troop to back still be likely that battalion two may be left however have practically to choose between going at once waiting at least month may be sure that censorship must be put on with round turn that must not be allowed to say word of fashoda business must be only thing worth telegraphing about so have voted for going of course understand that pressure have be put upon on account of curious affair at fashoda fortunately none of be sorry to be off there be certain to be pause now for time one doe not want to be kicking one heel about in ghastly town though be rather sharp peremptory work can not say that think sirdar be wrong whoever men may be must go be certain of course will be somewhat delicate business france be if be frenchman who be there be sure to be immensely sore over business be certainly very desirable that nothing must be written from here must increase that feeling have doubt sirdar telegraphed home for instruction a soon a got news of affair imagine that going up in morning with five gunboat be proof that have already received instruction of sort hope force be not french feeling against be tremendously strong in france certainly will not like backing down will have to do fight with big talk think be ready to risk war with especially a though occupation of fashoda must be immense annoyance to must be of possible utility to by way have got to sell horse there be possibility of taking down be question of giving away rather than of selling for of course officer of british regiment want to buy have horse for gave twenty five pound at cairo be welcome to can give couple of pound for saddle thing be very much obliged to must be robbery not at if wo take will have shot tonight horse must not possibly pick up food here must die of starvation without master must be still more cruel to give to native for be brutal horse master well in case will be glad indeed to have be extremely obliged to be right if will send man round will hand over to a be going tomorrow be likely that will go with for be going down also a far a abu hamed for ten day will be pleasant though know that will be so for for own majority of be rather sour tempered at present though may be glad enough to go one doe not care to be sent off at moment notice just a fractious child be turned out of room when elder want private chat however for be not inclined to grumble want to go therefore stand on order of going later general hunter gave gregory order for passage in steamer on correspondent of various newspaper be going down what will take master zaki asked just clothes stand in zaki have got couple of dervish remingtons several packet of ammunition will take can get four more will take down a know people about hebbeh be not disposed to be friendly suppose for minute that be likely to show hostile feeling for may be sure that fall of omdurman have spread by time over whole land will be on best behaviour still be just a well to be able to defend will engage four men at abu hamed to go with will leave kit here be pleasant run down river to atbara correspondent be heartily glad to be on way home irritation have at first felt at being so suddenly ordered away at moment when so unexpected interesting development occurred have subsided have witnessed one of most interesting battle ever fought have seen overthrow of mahdi be looking forward to european comfort luxury again at atbara left steamer be to take in store go up again at once proceeded by military train with first of returned european regiment at abu hamed gregory left first enquiry be whether boat be going down river learned that several native craft be leaving at once engaged passage in one of to hebbeh have difficulty whatever in engaging four sturdy arab from among who be listlessly hanging round little station while be doing zaki bought food for six men for week in le than two hour from arrival at abu hamed gregory be on board boat at once dropped down river a current be running strongly be off hebbeh next morning at eight o'clock boat put off took gregory party ashore a be seen to land village sheik at once came down to be there anything can do for lord asked yes have come here to ascertain whether of who be present at attack upon party who landed from steamer over there be still living here there be question of punishment on contrary have come here to obtain information a to private matter anyone who can give information will be well rewarded there be three men alive who be here at time lord there be more fled when boat with white troop came up from merawi believe went to dervish camp at three here be quiet respectable men be asked many question guided white officer to place where wad etman stood be there that who landed from steamer first rested to place where great house of suleiman wad gamr emir of salamat stood be there that much to be regretted attack on white men be made when white army came up six month afterwards blew up house cut down palm tree in village be with force came up from merawi last year will bring three men speak of must question one by one assure that need not be afraid of answering truthfully even if be concerned in attack upon white officer crew of steamer for step will be taken against be eighteen year since then doubt house be destroyed grove cut down when british column came here found place deserted be ready to reward if obtain information require from three men be presently brought to spot where gregory have seated in shade of one of hut zaki stood beside four armed men took post short distance away first called up be very old man in reply to gregory question said be already old when steamboat ran ashore took hand in business white men have done harm while follower of mahdi have killed many of family friend heard be going to be done stayed in house call upon allah to witness that what say be true do know if remains of expedition be still in existence lord when white troop came here month afterwards fled a here did know before destroyed wad gamr house took away box of paper have be brought ashore from ship be still in house know of nothing else clothes of men on board steamboat be divided among who took part in attack there be little booty gregory knew that at wad gamr house few sign of tragedy have be found when general brackenbury troop entered bloodstained visiting card of stewart few scrap of paper field glass have alone be discovered besides box of paper next man who came up said that have be with party who fell upon engineer crew of boat by riverside be ordered to kill said have not done so must have be killed do know whether booty be hidden away before english came lord there be booty taken money be found on board steamer stripped of brass work took wood ashore to burn sheik gave dollar half man for what have done there may have be money found on ship a own men be on board first took that thought of value have naught to say about never heard of anything being hidden before british troop arrived arab shook head lord there may have be though never heard of went fought at kirkeban when be beaten fled at once to berber remained there until white troop have gone down country may want to question again tomorrow gregory said here be two dollar will give a much more if want again third man be then called up be evidently in fear be afraid to answer truly gregory said if do so no harm will come to share may have have in affair if answer falsely truth be afterwards discovered will be punished now where be when business took place be ordered by wad gamr to gather near house when signal be given be to run in kill white men saw go up to house have be told to leave arm behind one of sheik servant came out waved arm ran in killed what happened then carried body outside house then took what money be found in pocket with watch other thing in to sheik paid dollar half head said that must have clothes for share have jacket belonging to one of when got home found that there be pocket inside in be book partly written on many other bit of paper what became of gregory asked eagerly threw into corner be of use to when white troop came up in boat beat at kirkeban came straight home seeing pocketbook took hid under rock for thought when white troop got here must find that might then destroy house cut down tree then went away did not come back until have gone where be pocketbook now may be under rock where hid lord have never thought of since be rubbish can take to place think so be not far from house pushed under first great rock came to for be in haste wanted to be away before white soldier on camel must get here did hear of other thing being hidden think everything be given up if thing have be of value must perhaps have told sheik a be only written paper of use to anyone did not trouble to do so well let go at once gregory said rising to foot although of use to paper may be of importance followed by zaki four men gregory went to peasant house stood quarter of mile away be not house lived in then man said white troop destroyed house in village when have gone built on same spot hill rose steeply behind peasant went on till stopped at large boulder be rock said where thrust under a far a arm must reach pushed in on upper side man lay down be just about here said be here lord can just feel can not get out pushed in a far a tip of finger must reach well go down cut couple of stick three four foot long in ten minute man returned with now take one of when feel book push stick along side until be well beyond then ought to be able to scrape out if can not do so will have to roll stone over be big rock with two three pole one ought to be able to turn over after several attempt however man produced packet gregory opened with trembling hand contained a man have said large number of loose sheet evidently torn from pocketbook covered with close writing opened book accompanied be written in ink first few word sufficed to tell that search be over began khartoum thank god after two year of suffering misery since fatal day at el obeid be once again amongst friend be true that be still in peril for position here be desperate still army be coming up to help may be here in time even if must not do so may be found when come will be given to dear wife at cairo if be still there name be mr hilliard address will surely be known at bank be paper be looking for said to zaki will tell about afterwards handed ten dollar to native thrust packet into breast pocket walked slowly down to river have never entertained hope of finding father evidence of death gave shock mother be right then have always insisted there be possibility that might have escaped massacre at el obeid have done so have reached khartoum have started full of hope of seeing wife child have be treacherously massacred here must not now read message from grave must be reserved for time when be alone knew enough to be able to guess detail must not be otherwise than painful felt almost glad that mother be not alive to loss be scarcely real one father have left when infant although mother have so often spoken of have scarcely be reality to gregory for when became old enough to comprehend matter seemed to certain that father must have be killed must then hardly understand how mother must cling to hope father have be more real character to since started from cairo than ever before knew desert now fierce inhabitant must picture battle since fight at omdurman have be able to see before wild rush on egyptian square mad confusion charge of handful of white officer one white man going off with black battalion held together if then be shock to to know how father have died how vastly greater must have be to mother have pictured a dying suddenly fighting to last scarce conscious of pain till received fatal wound have said to gregory that be better to think of father a having died thus than lingering in hopeless slavery like neufeld must have be agony to to know that did suffer for two year that have then struggled on through danger to khartoum be on way back full of hope love for when be treacherously murdered village sheik met a went down have found nothing lord nothing few old paper said will report well of hope to great english commander will certainly tell that did in power to aid walked down towards river one of men who have gone on while have be speaking to sheik ran back to meet there be steamer coming up river lord be fortunate indeed gregory exclaimed have intended to sleep here tonight to bargain with sheik for donkey camel to take back will save two day two three native craft be fastened up to shore waiting for breeze to set in strong enough to take up gregory at once arranged with one of to put party on board steamer in boat in quarter of hour gunboat approached rowed out to meet a came up gregory stood up shouted to to throw rope be done officer came to side want passage for myself five men to abu hamed be officer on general hunter staff with pleasure have come down from front asked a gregory stepped on board with five black yes then can tell about great fight heard of at dongola beyond fact that have thrashed khalifa taken omdurman received particular before begin have drink be horribly annoying to went on a sat down under awning steward brought tumbler soda water whisky two lemon gregory refused whisky took lemon with cold water horrible nuisance officer went on be one of gordon old steamer have broken down twice still console by thinking that even if have be in time very likely must not have be taken up hope however there will be work to do yet a see have got three of native craft in tow be a much a can do to get up cataract now please tell about battle gregory gave outline of struggle of occupation of omdurman of what might be called funeral service of gordon at khartoum be dark before story be finished by way officer said a be about to sit down to dinner while be on deck did not ask about men must order food to be given have plenty gregory said brought enough for week with thought that might be detained two three day here be obliged to make journey by land to abu hamed have not asked what be doing at out of way place how long have be here only landed morning came down to search for relic father be on board stewart steamer a there must be nothing doing at omdurman for few day got leave to run down be fortunate in securing boat at abu hamed on arrival there have be equally so now in having be picked up by so that will not be away from omdurman more than seven day if have equal luck in getting steamer at atbara think will be disappointed for white troop be coming down store be going up for egyptian brigade so be certain not to be kept there many hour sirdar have gone up to fashoda suppose must have got leave yes heard at merawi from officer in command that foreign troop have arrived there suppose nothing more be known about news will probably come down for fortnight perhaps longer than who can be general idea be that be french can only be french party from congo state have tremendous cheek whoever be officer said be precious lucky for that have given khalifa something else to think about may be sure must have wiped out pretty quickly unless be very strong force doe seem probable sirdar have taken regiment up with yes suppose actual move will be made at present suppose will be diplomatic business still must think must have to go one have doubt about at omdurman gregory said after expense trouble have have to retake soudan be not likely that must let anyone else plant on road to great lake when will be at abu hamed sir will be there about five o'clock at rate think may safely reckon on catching morning train go think at eight be sure to catch train soon for order have be sent down railway material will be sent up a quickly a possible a have be decided that railway will be carried on at once to khartoum expect that a soon a nile fall will make temporary bridge across atbara be six in morning when steamer arrived at abu hamed gregory at once landed paid four men went up to little station hour later be on way to atbara fort have two hour to wait there reached omdurman at three o'clock on following afternoon a landed met officer knew be there news asked nothing fashoda be talked about have be ascertained that force there be undoubtedly french betting be about even a to whether france will back down not have made difficult for by outburst of enthusiasm at what considered defeat of england well of course doe not go for much except that make harder for government to give in have news be received of whereabouts of khalifa broadwood with two regiment of egyptian cavalry camel corp started in pursuit of khalifa osman hour after be found that have got away slatin pasha went with a horse have be at work day have to stop at half past eight must not then get down to water bivouacked where have halted at four in morning started again at half past eight found spot where must get down to river then rode fifteen mile farther be now thirty five mile from omdurman one of gunboat have gone up with supply owing to nile having overflowed must not get near enough to land next morning got news that khalifa be twenty five mile ahead have just obtained fresh camel so be ordered to return to town have picked up good many of fugitive among khalifa favourite wife who doubtless with other woman have slipped away at one of halting place feeling unable to bear constant fatigue hardship of flight in desert cavalry have since be out again beyond fact that khalifa have be joined by many of fugitive from battle be making for kordofan certain news have be obtained at present nothing can be done in direction that horse bought be all right really did not like taking for already have one looked almost like robbery giving two pound for saddle others have done a well officer laughed one of brigade staff bought horse for pound from burleigh who have given forty for at cairo there be help for must not take horse down besides be not loss after newspaper can afford to pay for must have be coining money of late that reconciles gregory laughed did not think of correspondent expense being paid by paper know anything about arrangement stand to reason that must be so in campaign like in ordinary war man can calculate what outlay might be on expedition of kind one must foretell what expense might have to incur besides sirdar have saved newspaper enormous expenditure correspondent have be rigidly kept down to message of few hundred word whereas if have have own way must have sent down column of course correspondent grumbled have doubt employer be very well pleased newspaper must have saved thousand of pound by restriction be back sooner than expected general hunter said when gregory went in reported arrival be scarce week since left just week sir everything went smoothly be three four hour at hebbeh did succeed in search yes sir most fortunately found man who have hidden pocketbook have taken from body of one of white men who be murdered there there be nothing in old paper when brackenbury expedition approached have hidden away did not give thought until enquired if knew of paper other thing connected with on board steamer at once took to place where have hidden under great stone turned out to be notebook journal of father who be a thought possible white man who have arrived at khartoum short time before place be captured by dervish who have gone down in steamer carried colonel stewart well hilliard general said kindly even certain knowledge of death be better than fear that might be in slavery told have remembrance of none sir of course mother have talked of so often have several photograph of last taken at cairo before left so that almost seem to have known however do feel a relief to know that be not a feared be remotely possible slave among baggara think be hard that after having gone through two year of trial suffering must have be murdered on way home doubt be so have read father diary yet sir have not have heart to do so will put off until shock that have given have passed away feel that little hard work will be best thing for be there chance of have just returned in time be going up blue nile tomorrow morning to clear out village doubt be full of fugitive be glad that have come back be speaking of today to general rundle who be in command one of object of expedition be to prevent fadil from crossing river be advancing from gedareh at head of ten thousand troop to join khalifa be forty mile away on day after took place when received news of victory fell back if can cross will bring very formidable reinforcement to khalifa know that colonel parson started from kassala on th object being to capture gedareh during absence of fadil be to cross atbara at el fasher will then march up bank of river till be at nearest point to gedareh be probable that will not strike across before th th force be comparatively small know how large garrison fadil will have left there altogether be uneasy about expedition be very desirable that parson must know fadil be retiring so far a can learn from native have not yet crossed blue nile gedareh be said to be strong place once there parson might hold against fadil until can send reinforcement in order to convey information to require someone on whom can absolutely rely said that if be here felt sure that must volunteer for service of course be to certain extent dangerous one think that speaking language a do a have already be among dervish might even if taken prisoner make out good story for must undertake commission with pleasure gregory said will of course go in native dress propose that carry hundred mile up river with there land from point must not be more than sixty seventy mile across desert to atbara must strike forty fifty mile above el fasher of course must be able to learn there whether parson have crossed if have must ride up bank till overtake if have not must probably meet at mugatta must cross below that a be there leaf river seems simple enough sir story must be be one of dervish who have escaped from battle here have stopped at village thinking be safe from pursuit until boat came along that then crossed desert to go to gedareh where thought must be safe must surely carry through will want two fast camel one for one for boy can get for from abdul azil abadah sheik of course will put on dervish robe badge yes sir will go across tell general rundle obtain written instruction for to carry despatch to parson will give to when go up on boat in morning will see at once about camel ask intelligence people to get two of dervish suit will also want rifle thank sir have couple of remingtons plenty of ammunition for have two spear also picked up when came in here be off again zaki said when returned to hut where black be engaged in sweeping up dust arranging everything a usual yes master zaki suspended work when do go tomorrow morning do take everything with start in uniform will want dervish dress need not trouble about will be got for then be going among dervish again well hope be not may meet of be going with expedition up blue nile will then land strike across desert to atbara be enough for to know at present will take gun spear with zaki have curiosity if master

feeble almost before knew what have happened enemy have burst in on one side of square then be wild confusion camel dervish flying egyptian screaming camp follower be mixed in confusion other side of square be also attacked of men be firing at in front others turning round shooting into crowded mass in square be with black regiment on side opposite to where burst in white officer who have be in command have fallen ill have be sent back few day after left khartoum a have be for week before aiding to best of power there be other officer to spare hick asked to take place a have done everything must for poor fellow comfort on march have come to like to obey order a promptly a of former commander a long a other two side of square stood firm did so soon gave way saw hick with staff charge into midst of dervish then lost sight of seeing that be lost called to men to keep together to march off in regular order repel assault a be only hope there be of getting free obeyed order splendidly two three time dervish charged upon black be a steady a rock volley be so fatal that enemy finally left alone preferring to aid in slaughter of panic stricken egyptian to share spoil made for well man drank fill who have water bottle filled then marched on towards el obeid before dervish horse have closed up round at daylight infantry have also arrived fighting began day held position killing great number losing many men ourselves by night water be exhausted then soldier offered to attack enemy be twenty to one against said to 'no fight one day longer if can hold on dervish may retire may offer term ' so stood by next evening have lost half number after have drawn off one of dervish emir came in with white flag offered life to who must surrender must wear badge of mahdi be soldier replied that answer must be given in morning when have left gathered men together 'you have fought nobly said 'but have scarce round of ammunition left if fight again tomorrow will be slaughtered thank in name of khedive for that have done urge to reject term offered death must not benefit khedive a far a be concerned be free to accept term offered talked for time together then three native officer who be still alive came forward 'bimbashi said 'what will be done about be mahometans countryman be white man christian must not fight for mahdi 'no said ' must not fight for must gain life at price of being slave wish to settle matter without reference to will take chance may not be here in morning one man might escape where many must not ask be may not be watched if in morning be not here can say that disappeared know how know what be going to do yet went away in quarter of hour returned said that men must surrender if have water ammunition must go on fighting till end a have must surrender felt that be best soudanese love battle must a readily fight on one side a on other have done duty well to khedive will doubtless fight a bravely for mahdi men lay in square a have fought with sentry placed to warn must dervish make night attack british troop must have be well nigh maddened with thirst after being twenty four hour without water fighting day in blazing sun felt little be thirsty in desert march be accustomed to thirst to hold on for long time without water be better off for have drunk sparingly day before from water bottle have still draught left in waited until thought that men be asleep then stripped stained from head to foot have carried stain with in case might have to go out a native to obtain information in valise have native dress native cloth in must have passed a peasant not a one of baggara however put on passed through sleeping men went up to sentry know ' said be bimbashi be going to try get through line if be known how have escaped will be pursued slain will swear to that if be questioned will say know nothing of flight ' swear by beard of prophet ' man said allah protect lord ' then went on night be fairly dark a dervish be nearly mile away have fear of being seen by there be many of dead scattered about seventy eighty yard from square have along felt convinced that must be impossible to pas through line therefore went to spot where have noticed that number have fallen close together went about examining carefully must not have done to have chosen dress of emir a body might have be examined ordinary dead must pas unnoticed first exchanged robe for one marked with mahdi patch be already smeared with blood then carried body of man whose robe have taken off for distance laid down on face thinking that absence of patch must not be seen then crawled thirty forty yard nearer to dervish so that must seem have strength to get far before dying then lay down partly on side so that patch must show with face downwards on arm have before dyeing skin cut hair close to head on placed dervish turban only property brought out with be revolver pocketbook of buried in sand pocketbook short distance away pistol lightly covered within reach of hand so that must grasp sell life dearly if discovered soon after daylight heard triumphant yell of dervish knew that men have surrendered then there be rush of horse foot much shouting talking lifted head slightly looked across not dervish be to be seen in front of felt that have better move so taking up pistol hiding crawled on hand knee to spot where have hidden book then got up on to foot staggered across plain a if sorely wounded scarcely able to drag foot along a have hoped no one seemed to notice saw three four other figure also making way painfully towards where dervish have encamped here be few camel standing untended everyone have joined in rush for booty rush to be met with bitter disappointment for with exception of arm of fallen what few valuable might have about person there be nothing to be gained diverged from line have be following kept on until there be dip in ground must hide from sight of behind then started to run at last threw down in scrub four five mile away from point from have started be perfectly safe for present dervish be not likely to search over mile of desert dotted a be with thick bush question be a to future position be almost a bad a must be be without food water there be hundred of mile of desert between khartoum at water hole must almost certainly find party of dervish from time to time lifted head saw several large party of enemy moving in distance be evidently bound on journey be not thinking of looking for chewed sour leaf of camel bush to extent alleviated thirst determined at last must in first place march to well towards have be pressing when dervish came up to be nearly three mile south of spot where square have stood no doubt dervish must be there if discovered by be better to die so than of thirst hour before sun sank started horseman be in sight if be to come along must see long before must notice knowing general direction be fortunate enough to get sight of palm grove surrounded well before darkness set in lay about two mile away there be certainly moving object round lay down until twilight have passed then went forward when within two three hundred yard of grove lay down again waited that dervish must go to sleep however long might wait be too much to hope for must be sure to sit talk far into night of event of last three four day shielding a well a must by bush crawled up until be in midst of camel be browsing here stood up then walked boldly into grove a have expected two three score of dervish be sitting in group talking gravely have destroyed turk a always called egyptian infidel white leader have suffered heavily three hundred soudanese who have surrendered who have taken service with mahdi be poor compensation for loss have suffered ' year ago one old sheik said ' be father of eight brave son now have gone before four of fell in assault at el obeid two at baria last two have now be killed will meet again in abode of blessed sooner better for have one left to care for others have tale of loss of relation friend did not wait to listen further taking up large water gourd stood empty at foot of one of tree boldly walked to well descended rough step at water edge drank till must drink no longer then filling gourd went up again one noticed have looked at must have seen even in darkness great patch down front of robe think anyone did notice other figure be moving about from group to group kept on through grove until beyond tree came out on side opposite to have entered a expected found of dervish horse grazing among bush guard be placed over a be too well trained to wander far went out to chose poorest happened to be farther among bush than others have thought matter well over if good horse be taken there must be furious pursuit a soon a be missed might be soon for arab be passionately fond of favourite horse more so than be of family while have be waiting at edge of wood more than one have come out to pat fondle horse give handful of date poor animal must meet with such attention fact that be missing be not likely to be discovered till daylight probably great search must be made for others must ride on owner might spend hour in looking about thinking have strayed away be lying somewhere among bush have thought of trying to return to khartoum well be far apart dervish band be certain to be moving along line seemed to that el obeid be safest place to go to true be in hand of mahdist doubtless many wounded must be making way there doubtless must have wife child others might have come from distant village must make for town a only place where must find food water shelter riding till morning let horse graze threw down among bush intending to remain there until nightfall in afternoon on waking from long sleep sat up saw quarter of mile away dervish making way along on foot slowly painfully be very chance have hoped might occur got up at once walked towards bey friend be sorely wounded ' said bey journey be well nigh ended ' said ' have hoped to reach el obeid know that will not arrive at well lie three mile away have already fallen three time next will be last must that bullet of infidel have slain on spot ' poor fellow spoke with difficulty so parched be lip swollen tongue went to bush where have left gourd half full of water man be still standing where have left when saw gourd in hand gave little cry tottered feebly towards 'let friend drink ' said held gourd to lip beip little first said 'you can drink fill afterwards 'allah have sent to save ' said after two three gulp of water drew back head can rest till sun have set then go forward a far a well die there ' see wound ' said may be that can relieve pain little have be shot through body be marvel to how must have walked so far arab like other wild creature have wonderful tenacity of life aided to shelter of thick bush then let have longer drink bathed wound with water tearing off strip from bottom of robe bound round soaking with water over wound have be suffering more from thirst than from pain seemed stronger already 'now said 'you have better sleep ' ' have not slept since last battle said ' started a soon a be dark enough for to get up without being seen by turk have be walking ever since dared not lie down at first hoped might get to town where wife lived die in own house that hope left a grew weaker weaker have only prayed for strength enough to reach well to drink to die there ' beleep now ' said sure will not leave be not duty to help one when heat be over may go on have horse here will ride how far be from well to el obeid ' 'it be four hour journey on foot ' then will see wife before morning will stop at well to give horse good drink then if feel well enough to go on will not wait above hour allah bless ' man said then closed eye at once went to sleep lay down beside not to sleep be overjoyed with good fortune now must enter el obeid boldly wounded man being native there question must be asked have house to go to shelter for present a to what might happen afterwards did not care to think way of escape must surely occur in time once position a mahdist be fully established must be able to join party going towards khartoum must avoid questioning whereas if be to journey alone must be asked by band met where came from might at moment be detected if there happened to be from village must name a abode be important that poor fellow must live until at least have be with two day in town from time to time dipped piece of rag in gourd squeezed few drop of water between lip then laid on forehead when sun began to get low went out caught horse a came up dervish opened eye be better ' said 'you have restored to life head be cool lip no longer parched ' said will lift into saddle have better ride with leg on same side will be better for wound there be mound of earth few yard away if will stand up on can lift into saddle easily now put arm round neck will lift in standing position if try to get up wound might easily break out again managed better than have expected taking bridle led horse towards well must tell way said 'for be stranger in part having come from blue nile ' ' know perfectly ' said 'having be born in el obeid fought against mahdist till be starved out then a saw that power of mahdi be great allah be with did not hesitate to accept term to put on badge in le than hour saw tree marked position of well in half hour reached at least score of wounded men be there many of so sorely hurt that must get farther paid little attention to one of be known to saleh for wounded man told that be name also be from el obeid be suffering from terrible cut in shoulder have almost severed arm told man that be given by one of infidel officer before fell thought be a well to have two friend instead of one did what must to bind wound up fasten arm firmly to side then said to bey horse after three hour rest will be able to carry can sit behind saleh hold on with unwounded arm stranger be merciful man good one wonderful be that must give up horse to men who be stranger to walk on foot ' 'allah command to be compassionate to other what be walk of few mile be nothing be not worth speaking of say more about beseech be stranger in el obeid may be able to befriend there ' three hour later abdullah be name of second man mounted assisted to lift saleh in front of set out for el obeid got into town at daybreak there be few people about paid attention to wounded men have be coming in in hundred turning into street where men lived went first to house of saleh be at farther end be indeed quite in outskirt of place stood in walled enclosure be of better appearance than have expected went to door struck hand against voice within asked what be wanted said ' bring home master of house be sorely wounded ' there be loud cry door opened woman ran out ' touch abdullah exclaimed 'we will get down from horse first bring out angareb will lower down onto ' woman went in returned with angareb be usual soudan bed of wooden framework with hide lashed across directed how to lift one end against horse so saleh must slide down onto 'wife ' arab said when be done 'by will of allah who sent stranger to aid have returned alive name be mudil can not tell now what have done for house be be more than guest be master have promised to remain with till die be given back to life again do a bid in thing abdullah must have assisted to carry bed in told that might hurt arm woman must do 'you have better go off at once to own people abdullah there must be many here who understand treatment of wound have better get one at once to attend to arm ' will come again evening ' man replied consider that also owe life to when have stayed while here must come to wife child will desire to thank when tell how brought in here ' 'be there place where can put horse ' asked 'yes woman replied 'take to door in wall will go unfasten ' there be shed in garden into put horse then entered house most of arab woman know something of dressing of wound saleh wife sent out slave to buy various drug then got melon from garden cut off rind mincing fruit in small piece squeezed out juice gave to husband to drink when have done set before plate of pounded maize be boiling over little fire of stick when went in 'it be breakfast ' said waved hand ' can cook more said 'it matter not if eat till sunset sat down at once for indeed be famishing food have be exhausted at end of first day fighting have be more than two day without eating morsel have doubt ate ravenously for woman without word emptied content of pot into bowl then went out cut melon for when slave woman returned boiled of herb made sort of poultice of placed on wound saleh have fallen asleep moment have drunk melon juice did not move while poultice be being applied house contained three room one served a kitchen living room one leading from on right with curtain hanging before door be saleh room on opposite side guest chamber have not mentioned that there be four five child of whom have be turned out a soon a entered threatened with terrible punishment by mother if made noise when finished meal went into guest chamber threw down on angareb there slept till sunset when awoke found that native doctor have come examined saleh have approved of what woman have done told told to continue to poultice wound have given small phial from be to pour two drop into wound morning evening said what must have told that husband be in hand of allah if willed husband must live of course have seen something of wound for in old time seems lifetime back when be for two year searching tomb monument with professor there have be fray between workman band of robber there be also many case of injury incurred in work of moving heavy fragment of masonry moreover although have actual practice have seen good deal of surgical work for when be at university have idea of becoming surgeon attended course there saw good many operation have therefore of course general knowledge of structure of human frame position of artery so far wound examined when woman poured in what suppose be styptic looked healthy little inflamed of course skilled surgeon must have probed endeavoured to extract ball have not gone through soudanese be armed only with old musket be possible that ball have not penetrated far for if a have told be distance from square when be hit bullet be probably spent told woman so asked if have objection to endeavouring to find looked surprised 'be then hakim ' 'no have be at khartoum have seen how white hakim find way bullet have gone be sometimes able to get out at rate must not hurt if a be likely ball have not gone in very far for have done so must probably have died before got home might draw out ' 'you can try ' said 'you have saved life be yours ' 'bring pistol that husband have in belt ' brought to took out ramrod 'now said 'it be most important that must be clean therefore heat in fire so that be red hot then drop into cold water ' when have be done took handful of sand polished rod till shone afterwards wiped carefully with cloth then inserted in wound very gently have entered inch half when struck something hard must only be bullet be a have hoped ball have be almost spent when struck saleh be awake now have at once consented to suggestion having come to have implicit faith in 'it be see saleh just a have hoped felt sure that must not have gone in far a in case must never have walked twenty mile from battlefield to point where met now if have proper instrument might be able to extract bullet might hurt in doing so if must get out must recover speedily while if remains where be wound may inflame will die ' be not afraid of pain mudil ' must touch ball with finger beyond feeling that flesh in be embedded be not solid to touch must hing towards getting ball out dared not try to enlarge wound so a to get two finger in after thinking matter over in way decided that only chance be to make tool from ramrod heated again again flattening with pistol barrel till be not more than tenth of inch thick then cut from centre strip about quarter of inch wide then rubbed down edge of strip on stone till be perfectly smooth bent end into curve again heated to dull red plunged into water to harden finally rubbed with little oil be late in evening before be satisfied with work saleh ' said be going to try if will do if have one of tool have seen white hakim use be sure must get ball out easily enough think can succeed with if can not must make like so a to put one down side of bullet see curve make sort of hook difficulty be to get under bullet understand ' said ' mind hurting have seen men die of bullet even after wound seemed to heal know be better to try get out ' be difficult job pressing back flesh with finger succeeded at last in getting hook under bullet held firmly against to delight felt a raised finger hook together that bullet be coming few second later held triumphantly between finger saleh there be enemy think now that if there be inflammation will not be long before be well strong again 'truly be wonderful ' man said gratefully have heard of hakim who be able to draw bullet from wound have never seen done before ' if saleh have be white man must still have felt doubtful a to recovery be perfectly confident that wound of sort must heal well in arab especially a must be kept cool clean hard exercise life in open air entire absence of stimulating liquor only very occasionally if ever meat diet render almost insensible to wound must paralyse white surgeon have be astonished at rapidity with wounded prisoner recovered saleh wife have stood by a if carved in stone while performed operation when produced bullet burst into tear poured blessing on head be writing on following morning saleh have slept quietly night hand be cool morning think may fairly say that be convalescent abdullah wife came in yesterday evening told woman here that husband be asleep that must come round in morning warned not to let stir out of door said must come see have taken five hour to write seems very long time to spend on detail of thing not worth recording act of writing have taken thought off intend always to note down anything special will be interesting to to read if ever get away must be unable to escape will charge saleh to carry to khartoum if ever have chance hand over to governor there to send down to cairo week later be already losing count of day day matter nothing have be busy so busy have not even have time to write after have finished story so far saleh slave woman took to abdullah house found that be in state of high fever must do be to recommend that wet rag must be applied freshly wetted quarter of hour that head must be kept similarly enveloped in wet bandage that hand must be dipped in water very frequently when got back found several woman waiting outside saleh house wife have gossiped with neighbour told that have got bullet out of wound news spread rapidly woman be there to beg must see husband be awkward certainly must not calculate upon being successful in case where bullet have penetrated more deeply even if must do so must at once excite hostility of native hakim draw very much more attention upon than desired in vain protested be not hakim have done only what have seen white hakim do finding that did not avail said must not go to see man except with one of native doctor 'there be two here ' one of woman said will go fetch ' 'no said 'who be that must come to will go see if will show where live ' here come ' said a two dervish approached went up to said 'we hear that be hakim who have done great thing be hakim ' said be just coming to to tell so man aided be friend be not deeply wounded having seen white hakim take bullet from wounded men tried best a bullet be short way in succeeded if have have instrument saw infidel use must have be easy have to make instrument sufficed for purpose although must have be of use have bullet gone in deeper ' came in examined saleh wound bullet tool have made 'it be well ' said 'you have profited by what saw whence do come ' told same story have told saleh 'you have be time at khartoum ' 'not very long ' said went down once to cairo be there year be there came to know something of way of infidel be poor man very ignorant if will allow will act a assistant a know that there be many wounded here if will tell what to do will follow instruction carefully ' two hakim looked more satisfied at finding be not dangerous rival one said 'among thing have be brought in here be box who brought did not know what contained be too strong for to open though of course be able to hammer break open contained nothing many shining instrument only one that knew purport of be saw there be two box of same shape other contained number of little bottle of drug thought that maybe a box be alike shining instrument be used by white hakim ' can tell that if see ' said went with in house where booty of sort be stored saw chest knew be carried by hick medical officer one contained drug other variety of surgical instrument probe forceps amputating knife many other instrument of whose use be ignorant picked out three four probe forceps of different shape be instrument said 'with take out bullet with one of thin instrument search wound until find ball sometimes can not find even when have found sometimes can not get hold of with of tool a see open shut ' be knife for ' 'they use knife for cutting off limb twice have seen done for be travelling with learned hakim who be searching tomb for relic in one case great stone fell on man foot smashed hakim took off at ankle in case man have be badly wounded by bullet in arm be not one of party hearing of hakim skill have made journey of three day to wound be very bad said be too late to save arm so cut off above elbow 'and lived ' 'yes lived 'must do ' shook head requires much skill ' said saw how be done to do be be very different if there be man who must die if arm leg be not taken off must try to save life must not try unless be clear that man must die if be not done be learned men hakim if will take a assistant will show how white doctor take out ball if there be other way cut off limb when have once shown will do far better than ' two men seemed much pleased be evident to that if must do thing must widely add to reputation 'it be good ' said 'you will go round with see wounded will see for what can do will want chest carried ' 'no said will take instrument with must be necessary to cut off limb to try save life will need knife saw instrument heard white hakim call tourniquet use for stopping flow of blood while be cutting there be other instrument too will be required ' chapter hakim succeeded in getting out two more bullet then handed instrument to hakim saying that have shown knew must now leave matter in hand altogether must act a assistant if wished have fear that harm must come of for being so frequently engaged in war knew that have in rough way considerable skill in treatment of wound have impressed upon while probing wound that force must be used that sole object be to find exact course ball have taken a to amputation must probably not be attempted fighting dervish must rather die than lose limb be to die under operation relative must accuse operator of having killed remained at work with for two three day in nearly case failed to find course of ball when did so wound be not too deep generally succeeded in extracting be highly pleased took great pain to remain well in background be very friendly with fee be mostly horse carpet other article in accordance with mean of patient of gave portion together with money have be looted from chest carrying silver for purchase of provision payment of troop although made pretence of begging to remain always with refused saying that saw must no longer be of assistance to must see be inwardly pleased gave more money left saying that did not for moment suppose must tell anything further that if at time must send for must try recall what have seen white hakim do in case a be dealing with in meantime saleh be progressing very favourably indeed must have be up about have not peremptorily ordered to remain quiet 'you be doing well ' said must risk bringing on inflammation merely for sake of getting about few day earlier ' abdullah be also better still extremely weak have to order that meat must be boiled for hour that must drink small quantity of three four time day many time day woman came to to ask to see to husband wound sometimes wounded men came to serious case referred to hakim confined simply to dressing bandaging wound have grown angry for want of attention always refused to accept fee insisting be not hakim simply afforded help a friend have satisfaction however of doing great deal of good for in medicine chest found large supply of plaster bandage frequently mother brought child to must have treated with of simple drug in chest refused to do so for must not have explained in satisfactory way how knew one drug from be acquainted with quality still although refused fee have many little present of fowl fruit pumpkin other thing prevented feeling be burden upon saleh for of course put into general stock so far can not look back with deep gratitude for strange manner in have be enabled to avert suspicion even to make quite popular character among people of el obeid one bottle found in medicine chest be great prize to contained iodine with weak solution of be able to maintain colour did not care so much for face hand for be so darkened by sun that complexion be little fairer than of many of arab feared that accidental display of portion of body usually covered by garment must at once prove be white man have used up stuff have brought with when escaped from square having mean of procuring fresh stain be getting uneasy discovery of iodine put within power to renew colouring whenever be necessary about month later have be living here quietly since last wrote in journal day after have done so emir sent for said have heard that have taken bullet out of wound have shown two doctor of town how to do so by mean of instrument found in chest be among loot brought in from battlefield repeated story to a to how have acquired knowledge from being in service of white hakim from cairo who be travelling in desert have other medical knowledge except have seen in chest bottle contained stuff like that white doctor used in order to put patient to sleep so that must take off limb without feeling pain have heard of such thing being done by turkish hakim at khartoum did not believe be against reason have seen done lord ' said say that must take off limb a did be sure that stuff must put anyone to sleep ' wish to put to trial ' emir said 'one of son came back from battle with bullet hole through hand hakim said that two of bone be broken put bandage round son said more about be man who doe not complain of slight trouble yesterday evening pain became so great that be forced to mention when examined arm found that be greatly swelled slave have be bathing with cold water ever since pain have increased rather than diminished will look at lord greatly fear that be beyond poor skill to deal with ' young man be brought in on removing bandage saw that wound be in terrible state arm greatly inflamed distance up wrist be bad case seemed to that unless something be done mortification must speedily set in 'the two doctor saw hour ago ' emir went on 'and greatly fear for life told that must hing that a have seen white hakim do wonderful thing might be able to do something ' bey lord ' said 'it be one thing to watch operation quite to perform think a doctor have told son life be in great danger do believe that if there be white doctor here to take off arm might be saved must not undertake skill to do so be only acquired by long year of study how can poor man know how to do such thing be to attempt fail what must say that have killed son for might have recovered 'he will not recover ' emir said moodily 'what say abu have heard what man say what do think ' think father that be well to try man have used eye so well that have taken white man instrument drawn out bullet from wound feel a if wound will kill therefore if man fails will be none worse indeed must be better to die at once than to feel fire burning till burn up ' 'you hear what son say be of same opinion do best must fail swear by head of prophet that harm will come to ' wounded man be fine young fellow of three four twenty 'if be lord will will try ' said pray to bear in mind do so at command without much hope of accomplishing successfully must think be advisable that limb must be taken off above elbow so that will be above spot to inflammation have extended ' emir looked at son who said matter not father 't be left arm will still have right to hurl spear wield sword ' need not tell how got through operation everything required for inhaler sponge straight crooked needle thread be in chest young arab objected to be sent to sleep said might be well for coward not for fighting man have to assure that be not for sake for own wished to go to sleep that if knew be not suffering pain might be able to do thing without hand trembling that if knew be suffering must be flurried insisted that hakim must be sent for when came called to witness at emir command be going to try to do operation have seen white doctor perform although be ignorant man feared greatly that might fail really be desperately nervous though at same time did feel that having seen operation performed two three time a be simple one ought to be able to do of course have everything laid tourniquet be first put on arm screwed tightly then administered chloroform took effect speedily nerve be braced up now do think made fair job of finding tying up artery cutting sawing bone off making flap few stitch to keep together be done to relief arab who have lain a rigid a statue winced little when last stitch be put in be point on have be most anxious be not sure whether amount of chloroform have inhaled might not have be too strong for ' try to move ' said a opened eye looked round a if trying to remember where be a eye fell upon said 'when be going to begin ' have finished ' said 'but must lie quiet for time slightest movement now might cause flow of blood to burst out ' emir have stood staring at son quiet face a if amazed beyond power of speech four dervish have held patient limb so a to prevent accidental movement female slave have held large basin of warm water handed thing pointed to have begged hakim to keep attention fixed on be doing in order that also might see how white doctor did such thing when son spoke emir gave gasp of relief life murmured a if even now must scarcely believe that be possible a put hand upon shoulder trembled with emotion 'truly way of white infidel be marvellous abu son allah have be merciful must have meant that must not die thus have sent man who have seen white hakim at work to save life what be to be done now went on turning to 'he must be raised very gently clothes put under shoulder head then must be carried on angareb to coolest place in house may drink little juice of fruit have best eat nothing great thing be to prevent fever coming on with permission will stay with for if one of thread saw tie round little white tube in arm must slip give way must be dead in five minute unless machine round arm be tightened at once tube carry blood be tied up must be well that must have slave to fan hope will sleep ' emir gave order for bed to be carried to room adjoining harem mother young wife will want to see ' said to 'and when danger that speak of be past woman will care for will be master in room will give such order a please ' then turned off walked hastily away must see that have spoken with difficulty that in spite of effort to appear composed tranquil mouth be twitching eye moist a soon a bed have be placed by direction near open window four dervish left room hakim be on point of doing so when said will stay here for few minute will then come out talk matter over with have be fortunate indeed in remembering so well what saw white hakim explain how did thing why to sheik of wounded man party will tell what remember of with wisdom in matter will be able to do far better than ' when have retired door leading into harem opened woman slightly veiled followed by younger woman two slave girl came in stopped a be hurrying towards son ' said pray to speak very quietly in few word be most important that must not be excited in way must be kept perfectly quiet for next two three day will do so said beay touch 'you may take hand in yours let move will leave with for few minute please remember that everything depends upon not being agitated went out joined hakim mudil allah have given strange gift one of said be that must have remembered so well what saw more wonderful still be that must have firmness to cut saw flesh bone a if be of dead sheep with emir standing by to look at ' ' knew that life perhaps mine depended upon emir must have kept oath doubt not when became known in town abu who be known to for bravery goodness died in hand must not have be safe for to leave house ' then explained reason for step took listened most attentively asked several question showing that be intensely interested most anxious to be able to perform so wonderful operation be greatly surprised at fact that so little blood flowed seems said 'from what heard white hakim say that blood flowed through little white tube by twisting tourniquet very tight that flow of blood be stopped great thing be to find little tube tie up a must notice large one in inside of arm must be seen quite plainly when can

done so took firm hold of tooth wrenched out 'you can withdraw dagger said 'and then lift up let rinse mouth well with warm water brought in will have little pain afterwards though of course will take little time before swelling go down ' then went out left together in few minute abu came out have pain said must hardly believe when came round that tooth be out be relief indeed have cried day night for past three day 'tell for rest of day have better keep quiet go to sleep if possible have doubt will do a must be worn out with pain have be suffering ' ' begin to see mudil that be very ignorant

willing to heal to teach to persuade whom must benefit to allow to do work abu shook head 'that be ' said ' must rather be able to do such thing a do than be one of most famous soldier of mahdi must never persuade others say that mahdi although be hostile to turk must conquer egypt must willingly befriend white men even powerful a be can not go against feeling of emir must always be ignorant must always be fighting can see way out of can mudil ' can see one way ' said 'and may seem to impossible because know nothing of strength of england have a know easily beaten egyptian army be now protector of egypt if invade country a mahdi have already threatened to do be who will defend if there be other way of obtaining peace will day send army to recover soudan will fight will fight

benefited by certainly england must not undertake cost of such expedition lightly if be driven to by advance against egypt will assuredly do so people mean baggaras ally must suffer terribly people whom have conquered whose village have burned whose woman have carried off must rejoice 'we must fight abu said passionately 'certainly must fight fight gallantly must not avail besides abu must be fighting for ignorance have just regretted against teaching progress have wished for 'it be hard ' abu said quietly 'it be hard have be fate of people who have resisted advance of knowledge civilization who accept civilization a people of india of whom there be many more than in africa have accepted be prosperous in america other great country far beyond sea native indian opposed in vain

hardly even have named month be back again among friend can hardly say that be safer here than be at el obeid have not written because there be nothing to write one day be like a paper be finished there be incident in life let matter slide again again contemplated attempting to make way to town difficulty must be enormous there be danger of desert absence of well enormous probability of losing

account have be worsted traitor in town kept well informed of state of supply declared that be almost exhausted that garrison must surrender indeed several of commander of body of troop have offered to surrender post held by so have put aside hope of escape decided not to make attempt until after khartoum fell when dervish boasted must march down conquer egypt to sea have already taken berber dongola be at mercy thought best chance must be to go down with a far a went then to slip away in way must shorten journey must have to traverse alone being on river bank must at least always obtain water besides might possibly secure small native boat with help of current get down to assouan before dervish must arrive there must have attempted three week ago order came from mahdi to el khatim ordering to send to omdurman five hundred well armed men who be to be commanded by son abu khatim be to remain at el obeid with main body of force until further order abu came to at once with news will take with abu ' exclaimed 'this be chance have be hoping for once within day journey of khartoum must slip away at night must be very hard if must not manage to cross nile into khartoum ' will take if wish ' said 'the danger will be very great not in going with in making way into khartoum ' 'it doe not seem to that must be so ' said must strike river four five mile above town cut bundle of

afterwards captured can disguise appear a now be hide for while then find out where abu be join again perhaps when see that further resistance can be made general gordon will embark on one of steamer go down river knowing that must be better for people of town that mahdi must enter without opposition in case must scarcely do harm to peaceful portion of population to troop who have laid down arm havery well ' emir said have told that have tried to dissuade that will go owe great debt of gratitude for that have done for therefore will not try to dissuade trust allah will protect so started next morning rode by side of abu a knew be hakim who have taken off arm none wondered journey be made without incident worth recording abu did not hurry made long march between of well then halted for day so journeyed until made last halt before arriving at omdurman 'you be still determined to go ' abu said to ' will leave tonight friend ' ' will not forget that have told about people hakim must

india be like soudan before went there that there be great conqueror constant war peasant starved while robber grew rich that under rule peace contentment be restored must that must be so here seems

before thought of mother have said that be of good family that be on account of marriage with that have quarrelled with relation have always seemed strange to that must have be content to take a have told altogether subordinate position in mercantile house in alexandria have accounted for knowledge of arabic by fact that have be for two year exploring temple tomb of egypt with learned professor surely a man of good family must have found something to do in england instead of coming out to take so humble post in egypt gregory knew nothing of difficulty that young man in england have in obtaining appointment of kind of fighting way single handed influence went for much in egypt seemed to that even if father have quarrelled with own people there must have be many way open to of maintaining honourably therefore have always thought that although might have be that mother described tenderest most loving of husband gentleman estimable in respect father must have be wanting in energy ambition deficient in quality must fit to fight own battle content to gain mere competence instead of struggling hard to make way up ladder have accounted for going up a interpreter with hick pasha by fact that work with contractor be at end that saw other opening for now understood how mistaken have be in estimate of father character wondered even more than before why must have taken humble post at mother have certainly told again again that have done so simply because doctor have said that must not live in england surely in wide empire of england there must be innumerable post that gentleman must obtain perhaps must understand better day at present seemed unaccountable to felt sure that have lived father must have made name for that be in hope not of pay that must receive a interpreter that have gone up with hick have not died at little village by nile must assuredly have done so for narrative have left behind must in if published have shown what stuff there be in be

licensed to kill think be not sure that three year at bar must admit to practice usually seven eight year be spent before earn penny a for church have to go through university one of place call training college when at last be ordained may reckon unless have great family interest on remaining curate with perhaps one hundred one hundred fifty pound per annum for eighteen twenty year amount of

snug berth out in china ' must like agency in mesopotamia ' if have luck anything be possible if have luck ought to fall back on three alternative emigrate enlist hang of course can sponge on friend for year two if be mean enough to do so there be end to sort of thing in time may ask why put question hilliard have really splendid opening here be surely not going to be foolish enough to chuck with idea of returning to england taking anything may turn up be not so foolish a have have a say luck extraordinary luck have quite made up mind to stay in service be really asking because know so little of england wondered how men who have fair education family interest did get on very rarely do get on other said of course if be inventive genius may discover something engine for example will do twice work with consumption of fuel that other engine will do if chemically inclined may discover something will revolutionize dyeing for example not one man in thousand be genius a rule man be speaking of

now upon war date upon various regiment must go down chance of khalifa collecting army trying conclusion with invader again at last gregory got up went back to hut must now understand why father having quarrelled with family might have found obliged to take first post be offered however humble in order to obtain advantage of warm climate for wife must have felt awfully mused if have be sort of man have always thought must have settled down to life now know better can understand that must have be terrible for must be glad to exchange for interpretership where must have chance of distinguishing at rate of taking part in exciting event will open packet from what mother said think will be of interest to now fancy by what said that contained simply father instruction a to what be to do in event of death during campaign see what else can be drew curtain have rigged up at doorway window to keep out insect lighted lantern then sitting down on ground by bed opened packet mother have given outer cover be in handwriting dearest boy have a told kept enclosed packet be not to be opened until have certain news of father death news trust will day obtain a see enclosed packet be directed to think that will find in anything of importance to yourself probably contains only direction advice for guidance in case must determine to return to england have be le anxious to open because have be convinced that be so for of course know circumstance of family there must be nothing new that must write to on score have told that quarrelled with father because chose to marry a have heard from be daughter of clergyman at death took post a governess father fell in love with be son of honorable james hartley who be brother to earl of langdale father have elder brother mr hartley be man of type now happily le common than be twenty year ago have younger brother portion small estate have belonged to mother be a proud a if have be peer of realm owner of county know exactly what law of england be whether at death of brother grandfather must have inherited title not never talked on subject with father who very seldom alluded to matter at home have also two sister a be clever have already gained reputation by exploration in egypt be moreover exceptionally handsome man at least thought so grandfather made up mind that must make very good marriage when learned of father affection for be absolutely furious told son that never wished to see again spoke of in manner gregory resented a result quarrelled father left house never to enter again must have released from promise must not hear of be married have written for magazine newspaper on egyptian subject thought that must make living for with pen unhappily found that great number of men be trying to do same that although paper on egyptian discovery have always be accepted be quite thing when came to write on general subject have hard time of be very happy nevertheless then came time when health began to give way have terrible cough doctor said that must have change to warmer climate be very poor then so poor that have only few shilling left lived in one room father saw advertisement for man to go out to branch of london firm at alexandria without saying word to went obtained thanks to knowledge of arabic be getting on well in firm when bombardment of alexandria took place office store of employer be burned a must take many month before must be rebuilt employee be ordered home who chose to stay be permitted to do so received three month pay father saw that there must be many chance when country settled down so took post under contractor of meat for army moved to cairo shortly after arrival there be a thought fortunate in obtaining appointment of interpreter with hick pasha did not try to dissuade everyone supposed that egyptian troop must easily defeat dervish there be danger of course seemed to a did to that opening must lead to better thing when rebellion be put down must be able to obtain good civil appointment in soudan be not thought of pay a interpreter weighed in slightest with of be anxious above thing that must be restored to position where must associate with gentleman a one of must again take real name gregory started a read have never have idea that name bore be not rightly own even statement of grandfather name have not struck a affecting father have honourable pride in name be old one when took post at alexandria be little above of ordinary office messenger did not care that must be recognized that one of name must be known to be occupying such station did not change name simply dropped surname full name be gregory hilliard hartley have always intended when have made position for to recur to of course will be open to to do so also know that must have be wish that like must not do so unless have made position for that must be credit to on starting father left to decide whether must go home imagine that packet merely contains view on subject knew what mine be must rather have begged bread than have gone back to ask for alms of man who treated son so cruelly be probable that by time old man be dead must object a much to have to appeal to husband brother character disliked although knew that father mean be small be extravagant to last degree old man be weak enough to keep in perpetual difficulty to satisfy son father looked for pecuniary assistance from brother latter might at least have come to see written kindly to when be in london a father be writing in own name for magazine address must be easily found out by anyone who wanted to know never sent one single word to must object quite a much to appeal to a to old man a to sister who be younger than husband be nice girl even if grandfather be dead have a doubt must be case left what have between certainly must not amount to much father have told that old man have mortgaged estate up to hilt to pay brother debt that when came to be sold a probably must be at death there must be very little left for girl therefore certainly must not go ask to support hope be dear boy that may be able to make way here in same manner a father be doing when fell that someday may attain to honourable position in will be able if visit england to call upon aunt not a one who have anything to ask of a relative of whom need not feel in way ashamed feel that end be very near gregory hope to say have to say to before come may not have opportunity in case time may elapse before read will come to a voice from grave be not in way wishing to bind to course of action only to explain fully position to to tell thought god bless dear boy prosper keep know enough of to be sure that course may be will bear a true gentleman worthy of father of name bear loving mother gregory sat for time before opening other enclosure contained open envelope on be written to wife three others also unfastened addressed respectively hon james hartley king lawn tavistock devon second g hilliard hartley esquire albany piccadilly london third miss hartley address being same a of father first opened one to mother dearest wife hope that will never read line that will return to safe sound be writing in case must be otherwise that will never have occasion to read instruction rather must say advice for be more than that did talk matter over be so wholly averse from idea of ever appealing to father family however sore strait to might be reduced must not urge matter upon yet although sympathize most thoroughly with feeling think that in case of dire necessity must do so at least afford father opportunity of making up for treatment of small sum left in hand must soon be exhausted if be killed will perhaps obtain small pension assuredly must not be sufficient to maintain boy in comfort know that said at time possibly must add to by teaching must be so may be able to remain in egypt when boy grows up will obtain employment of sort here must be unsuccessful in direction see what must do be to go to england with child what chance must have of obtaining employment there without friend reference be frightened at prospect know be alone must do anything rather than apply to people have child

have job in getting animal ashore of course will take driver on with sheik told camel be two of fastest have ever have have sent saddle with water skin latter will probably not want if go well still be better to take will assuredly do so sir may be useful to on ride though suppose camel must do well enough without be always well to be provided when one go on expedition for emergency may occur hour later steamer started river be still full current rapid did not move more than five mile hour against at village passed people flocked down to bank with cry of welcome waving of flag felt now that deliverance be accomplished that be free from tyranny have for so many year oppressed bank be for most part low save at village journey be monotonous one steamer kept on way till then anchored started again at daybreak at breakfast general hunter said think that in two hour will be pretty well due west of el fasher so have better presently get into dervish dress have got iodine from doctor have not yes have better stain over take good supply in case have to do again gregory went below have head shaved by one of soudanese then re stained from head to foot put on dervish attire loose trouser long smock with six large square patch arranged in two line in front white turban pair of shoe completed costume officer laughed a came on deck again look out out dervish hilliard one of said be lucky that there be none of lancer scouting about must hardly give time to explain especially with rifle spear presently came to spot where water be deep up to bank be six foot above level barge with camel be brought up alongside have bulwark a deck be level with land camel be with good deal of pressing on part of driver pushing by a many soudanese a must come near enough to got ashore none of soudanese recognized gregory looked greatly surprised at sudden appearance of two dervish among a soon a camel be landed gregory zaki mounted have better keep if anything to south of east general hunter last instruction have be unless parson have be greatly delayed must be two three day march farther up river mile strike stream behind be so much time lost waved hand to wished farewell a started staff shouted wish for safe journey black soldier seeing that whoever dervish might be be well known to general officer raised cheer to zaki who have hitherto kept in background waved rifle in reply a face be familiar to number of soudanese now recognized cheered more heartily than before laughing like schoolboy at transformation chapter gedareh abdul azim be right about camel gregory said a soon a be fairly off have never ridden on one like before what difference there be between ordinary camel be not only that go twice a fast motion be so pleasant easy yes master be riding camel of good breed cost twenty time a much a others think nothing of keeping up rate for twelve hour without stop if do that will be near atbara before be dark be ten o'clock now if general hunter map be right have only about eighty mile to go must think be trotting seven mile hour carried rifle slung behind across shoulder rather than upright a be arab fashion spear be held in right hand must see if ca fasten spear in other way zaki must find nuisance if held in hand way must say must be easy to fasten across saddle in front of if see horseman in distance can take into hand think master must be easier to fasten behind saddle where there be more width ring on saddle on side short halt be made spear fixed gregory then looked at compass must make for rise two three mile away see exactly point must aim for when get there must look at compass again kept steadily on for six hour have seen human figure since started will stop here for hour gregory said give animal drink of water handful two of grain think will want water master have a much a must drink before starting be accustomed to drink when work be over very well at rate will take something opened one of water skin poured of content into gourd then sitting down in shadow of camel ate date bread have only brought native food with so that if captured examined there must be nothing to show that have be in contact with european gregory have even left revolver behind a being armed with so good weapon a remington be hardly likely that must be needed if found upon must be accepted a proof that be in employment of infidel be dusk when arrived at bank of river incident have marked journey have seen sign dervish be in neighbourhood atbara be in full flood be rushing down at six seven mile hour colonel parson must have have great difficulty in crossing zaki be hardly likely to have brought boat across from kassala know whether have gun with if have think can have crossed even if made raft enough to carry kept along bank until reached spot where river have overflowed here camel drank fill little grain be given to then be turned loose to browse on bush there be fear of straying suppose zaki master be always turned loose at night a there be plenty of bush here will not go far after meal lay down to sleep a soon a be light zaki fetched in camel continued journey in hour arrived at village people be already astir looked with evident apprehension at seeming dervish have party of infidel passed along here gregory asked village sheik who came out salaamed humbly yes lord party of soldier with white officer came through here three day ago how many be there of there must have be more than thousand of many more not many perhaps hundred more servant did not count have cannon with lord be on foot carried gun there be mounted men cannon where be fadil army that thus allowed so small force to march along unmolested say that be still near nile two of scout be here day before turk came along stayed here for hour a said nothing about turk coming from kassala suppose did not know have crossed river well must go on see where be must be mad to come with so small force when must have known fadil have large army will never go back again without further talk gregory rode farther on at village through passed have news of passage of colonel parson command camel have be resting from time when omdurman be taken having be well fed that morning gregory did not hesitate to press troop must not march above twenty five mile day two day must take to mugatta so that if halted there for day must be able to overtake night character of country be now greatly changed bush be thick high passage through must be very difficult for mounted men there be fear therefore that must turn off before arriving at mugatta from place there must probably be track of sort to gedareh be thirty mile ride on arriving near village gregory saw that considerable number of men be assembled there checked camel what do make out to be zaki eye be better than mine may be colonel parson force on other hand may be dervish who have closed in behind to cut off retreat be not dervish master zaki said after long steady look have not white turban of clothes be light dark have dark cap like soudanese troop wear that be good enough zaki will turn robe inside out so a to hide patch a otherwise might have hot reception when be quarter of mile from village several men started out from bush rifle in hand be in egyptian uniform be friend gregory shouted in arabic be officer of khedive have come from omdurman with message to commander native officer one of party at once saluted will find bey in village bimbashi how long have be here came in yesterday hear that will start tomorrow know not whether be so be there dervish about yes forty of yesterday afternoon coming from gedareh ignorant that be here rode in among outpost on hill to west three of be killed three made prisoner rest rode away with word of thanks gregory rode on dismounted when reached village be directed to neighbouring hut here colonel parson six white officer with be assembled native soldier be on sentry at door want to speak to parson bey colonel hearing word came to door colonel parson gregory said in english be major hilliard of egyptian army have honour to be bearer of message to from general rundle now in command at omdurman be well disguised indeed sir colonel said with smile a held out hand must never have taken for anything native where did spring from can never have ridden much le walked across desert from omdurman sir be landed from one of gunboat in general hunter with fifteen hundred soudanese troop be ascending blue nile to prevent fadil from crossing joining khalifa have written despatch be thought better must carry nothing so that even strictest search must not show be messenger be message of private character sir think not then will come in gregory followed colonel parson into hut contained one room gentleman former said with smile allow to introduce bimbashi hilliard who be bearer of message to from general rundle now in command at omdurman major hilliard be captain mackerrel commanding four hundred fifty men of th egyptian captain wilkinson equal number of arab battalion major lawson who have under command three hundred seventy arab irregular captain honorable h ruthven who have under eighty camel men also captain fleming of royal army medical corp who be at once medical officer in command of baggage column captain dwyer be like officer in egyptian army rank like a bimbashis now sir will deliver message to be of somewhat grave character sir general rundle thought very important that must be acquainted with last news sirdar have gone up white nile with of gunboat th soudanese deemed necessary to go because body of foreign troop believed to be french have established at exclamation of surprise broke from officer in next place sir fadil who have arrived with force within forty mile of khartoum have retired up bank of blue nile on hearing of defeat of khalifa major general hunter have therefore gone up that river with three gunboat soudanese battalion to prevent if possible from crossing joining khalifa who be reported to be collecting remains of defeated army be possible indeed general think be probable that fadil if unable to cross may return with army to gedareh be to warn of possibility that sent here gedareh be reported to be defensible position therefore think that if capture must be advisable to maintain there until reinforcement can be sent to either from blue nile atbara place seems be well supplied with provision store in event of fadil opposing must be far safer for to defend than to be attacked in open during retreat be certainly important news mr hilliard hitherto have supposed that fadil have joined khalifa before fight at omdurman there be therefore fear of reappearing here know very little of force at gedareh took prisoner yesterday account be very conflicting still there be reason to believe that garrison be not strong certainly a general rundle say must be in much better position there than if be attacked in open doubt arab who got off in skirmish yesterday carried news there probably of must go direct to fadil if came down upon here with eight thousand men position must be desperate one cost four day to cross river at el fasher must take a much to build boat recross here before time might be upon be evident gentleman that have only choice of alternative to march at once against gedareh to retreat immediately crossing river here at el fasher a to remaining here of course be out of question consultation be short one officer be in favour of pushing forward pointing out that a only th egyptian must be considered a fairly disciplined troop must lose heart if retired must not be relied upon to keep steady if attacked by largely superior force while at present must probably fight bravely arab battalion have be raised by italian be at present full of confidence a have defeated mahdist who have be besieging kassala arab irregular have of course fighting instinct of race must assault enemy bravely in defensive battle against greatly superior number must scarcely be expected to stand well a for eighty camel men be soudanese soldier discharged from army for old age physical unfitness must be relied upon to fight small in number a be must have little effect on issue of battle therefore agreed that having come thus far safest a well a most honourable course must be to endeavour to fight enemy in strong position although may be said that success justified wilder enterprise be ever undertaken than of sending thirteen hundred only partly disciplined men into heart of enemy country omdurman atbara to say nothing of previous campaign have shown how desperately dervish fought order for garrison of kassala to undertake can only have be given under entire misconception of circumstance of strength of army under fadil that must almost certainly be called upon to encounter be more probable a woman property of soldier have be left at gedareh when marched away men must therefore naturally wish to go there before made endeavour to join khalifa such indeed be fact fadil concealed from news of disaster at omdurman for day when became known have difficulty in restraining troop from marching straight for gedareh do go on with mr hilliard colonel parson asked when have decided to start for gedareh yes sir instruction be to go on with if town be besieged to endeavour to get through line carry news to general hunter if can ascertain whereabouts if not to make straight for omdurman have two fast camel will leave here return for with black boy when start will be glad to have with colonel said white officer be worth couple of hundred men a sat chatted gregory asked how force have crossed atbara be big job colonel parson said river be wider than thames below london bridge running something like seven mile hour brought with barrel to construct raft when be built supported ten men who started on be in spite of effort carried ten mile down stream be not until five hour after embarked that managed to land raft did not get back from journey till next afternoon being towed along opposite bank by men be evident that must not do egyptian soldier then took matter in hand made framework with wood of mimosa scrub covered with tarpaulin have fortunately brought with turned out one boat day capable of carrying two ton six day after reached river got across delay be terrible nuisance at time have enabled to come up here warn about fadil fortunately dervish came along while be crossing indeed learned from prisoner took yesterday that fact that force from kassala have crossed river be entirely unknown so no harm be done sheik of little village took charge of gregory camel store be also left there under small guard a be advisable to reduce transport to smallest possible amount next morning start be made bush be so thick that be necessary to march in single file in evening force halted in comparatively open country camel men reconnoitred ground for little distance round saw sign of enemy camped however in form of square lay with arm beside in readiness to resist attack night passed quietly at early dawn moved forward again at six o'clock camel men exchanged few shot with dervish scout who fell back at once at eight village be sighted force advanced upon in fighting order be found however to have be deserted except by few old people on being questioned said that emir saadalla who commanded have two hundred rifle six hundred spearmen have received order from fadil to surrender subsequent event showed that have be carefully tutored a to reply to be given force halted here a gedareh be still twelve mile away be thought better that if there be fighting must be fresh at midnight deserter from dervish came in with grave news that emir have three thousand five hundred men be awaiting two mile outside town there be informal council of war agreed that retreat through difficult country must bring about total annihilation of force that there be nothing to do to fight early in morning started again for first two hour road led through grass so high that even men on camel must not see above pushed on till eight o'clock when reached small knoll at foot of halted colonel parson officer ascended to reconnoitre saw at once that deserter news be true mile away four line of dervish marching in excellent order be making way towards colonel parson considered that number must not be le than four thousand at once decided to occupy saddle back hill mile away troop be hurried across dervish also quickened movement be too late to prevent hill from being seized arab battalion have be leading followed by egyptian while irregular divided into two body under arab chief guarded hospital baggage dervish at once advanced to attack of hill column wheeled into line to meet even on crest of hill grass be breast high did not impede view of advancing line of dervish into heavy destructive fire be at once poured enemy however pushed on firing in return being somewhat out of breath from rapidity with have marched seeing nothing of defender of hill save head inflicted far le loss than be suffering fight be continuing when colonel parson saw that force of about three hundred dervish have worked round back of hill with intention of falling upon baggage at once sent one of arab sheik to warn captain fleming who from position be unable to see approaching foe colonel parson have asked gregory to take up position with baggage a foresaw that with vastly greater number be likely that dervish might sweep round attack scarcely have messenger arrived with news when dervish came rushing on through high grass in spite of shout of doctor fleming gregory escort of one hundred twenty irregular arab stationed at point at once broke fled happily portion of camel corp with commander captain ruthven militia officer be close at hand though have thirty four of old soldier with rushed forward to meet enemy doctor fleming gregory joined cheering to encourage soudanese made determined stand gregory zaki kept up steady fire with remingtons picked off several of most determined of assailant fight however be too unequal dervish got in behind cut off rear portion of transport little band fighting obstinately fell back with face to foe towards main body one of native officer of soudanese fell captain ruthven very powerful man ran back lifted wounded soldier made way towards friend so closely pressed be by dervish three time have to lay burden down defend with revolver while gregory zaki aided retreat by turning fire upon assailant for splendid act of bravery captain ruthven afterwards received victoria cross flushed by success dervish pushed on fortunately at time main force of dervish be beginning to waver unable to withstand steady fire of defender of hill a drew back little egyptian arab battalion rushed forward shaken a be dervish be unable to resist attack broke fled pursued by arab battalion egyptian however obeyed order of captain mackerrel halting faced about to encounter attack from rear volley caused dervish to hesitate captain ruthven party reached summit of hill in safety enemy however maintained heavy fire for few minute volley of egyptian at distance of only hundred yard be so deadly that soon took to flight first shot have be fired at half past eight at whole dervish force be scattered in headlong rout have colonel parson possessed cavalry force enemy must have be completely cut up a be pursuit be out of question force therefore advanced in good order to gedareh here dervish emir who have be left in charge when rest of garrison moved out surrendered at once with two hundred black rifleman under have long be suspected of disloyalty by khalifa at once declared hatred of mahdism declaring that though have not dared to declare openly have always be friendly to egyptian rule men with at once fraternized with arab of colonel parson force be formally received into rank emir showed sincerity by giving information in power a to fadil position movement by pointing out most defensible position none of british officer have be wounded fifty one of men have be killed eighty wounded five hundred of dervish be left dead upon field including four emir not moment be lost in preparing for defence for be certain that fadil on hearing news must at once march to retake town position be naturally strong one standing on rising ground be fadil house surrounded by brick wall twelve foot high here egyptian battalion camel corp be placed with hospital two brass gun have be found there hundred yard away be enclosure with five foot wall two hundred yard away smaller one arab battalion be stationed to rear of in square enclosure with brick wall twelve foot high in be situated well four building be so placed that fire from covered approach to other two hundred yard from well enclosure be fortified house surrounded by high wall a latter must need too many men for defence wall be pulled down detachment placed in house time be lost whole force be at once employed in pulling down hut clearing ground of high grass forming zareba round town greatest cause for anxiety be ammunition large proportion of carried in pouch have be expended during battle next morning colonel parson with small force hurried back to mugatta to fetch up reserve ammunition have be left there under guard returned with three day later abundant supply of provision have be found in gedareh for here be magazine not only of four thousand men of garrison woman who have be left there sufficient for fadil army on return there be three four well good supply of water ammunition arrived just in time for on following morning captain ruthven camel men brought in news that fadil be close at hand at half past eight dervish began attack on three side of defence sheltered by long grass be able to make way to within three hundred yard of dwelling occupied by troop intervening ground have be cleared though time after time made rush forward be unable to withstand withering fire to be exposed after hour vain effort musketry fire ceased hour later strong reinforcement came up attack recommenced be accompanied with greater success than first attack fadil retired to palm grove two mile away of defender five men be killed captain dwyer thirteen men wounded for two day fadil endeavoured to persuade troop to make attack although surrounded town maintained scattered fire must not be brought to attempt assault having lost over five hundred men in two attack first day then fell back eight mile three day later colonel parson said to gregory think time have come mr hilliard when must apply for reinforcement be convinced that can repel attack be virtually prisoner here be to endeavour to retreat fadil must probably annihilate men have behaved admirably be one thing to fight well when be advancing to be firm in retreat most serious enemy at present be fever already stink of unburied body of dervish be overpowering day will become worse doctor fleming report to that have great many sick on hand that fear condition surround will bring about epidemic therefore have decided to send to general rundle for reinforcement will enable to move out to attack fadil very well sir will start at once will write despatch will be ready for to carry in hour time have better pick out couple of good donkey from captured here a be only nine o'clock will be able to get to mugatta evening think there be fear of being interfered with by dervish may be sure that fadil be not allowing men to roam over country for there can be little doubt that good many of must desert a soon a got fairly beyond camp think there be fear of sir a camel will have have ten day rest must have very little fear of being overtaken even if did sight be off again zaki gregory said will go down to yard where animal captured be kept choose couple of good donkey be to carry despatch to omdurman a time be precious will make straight line across desert will save fifty sixty mile be glad to be gone master smell here be a bad a be at omdurman when went in there yes be very glad to be off too hour later started arrived at mugatta at eight o'clock in evening native with whom camel have be left have taken good care of after rewarding taking meal gregory determined to start at once star be bright there be quite light enough for camel to travel water be emptied from skin filled again have brought with sufficient food for four day travel sack of grain for camel hour after arriving at village again started will follow river bank till get past country where bush be so thick then strike west by north saw by colonel parson map that be about line must take left river before reached el fasher continued journey night onward till sun be well up then watered camel have time brought with large half gourd for purpose ate good meal after placing two pile of grain before camel lay down slept until five o'clock in afternoon ought to be opposite omdurman tomorrow morning expect will strike river tonight have kept course rather to west of direct line on purpose must be very awkward if be to miss believe compass be right have struck match hour to look at very slight deviation must make big difference at end of hundred fifty mile be just midnight when saw river before ca go wrong now zaki be comfort how many mile be above junction with white nile know rode steadily on day be just breaking when exclaimed there be building opposite must be khartoum will be opposite omdurman in hour soon after six o'clock rode down to river bank opposite town in answer to signal large native boat be rowed across to after trouble camel be got on board in quarter of hour landed take camel up to house zaki must go report at headquarters general rundle have not yet gone out on gregory sending in name be at once admitted so be back mr hilliard general said be heartily glad to see for be very hazardous mission that undertook what news have be colonel parson report before reading long report general said tell in few word what happened overtook colonel parson at mugatta on third morning after leaving be attacked by nearly four thousand dervish five mile from gedareh after sharp fight be defeated occupied town without resistance four day later fadil came up with army attacked town be driven off with loss of five hundred men be now eight mile from town place be unhealthy although can be defended colonel parson have asked for reinforcement to enable to attack fadil be good news indeed have be extremely anxious for there be doubt that colonel parson force be wholly inadequate for purpose how long be since left about forty six hour sir indeed that seems almost impossible mr hilliard started at eleven o'clock in morning sir rode on donkey to mugatta where have left camel arrived there at eight started hour later on camel rode till nine o'clock next day halted till five have just arrived here camel be excellent beast travelled good six mile hour did not press a knew that if arrived opposite town at night must have difficulty in getting across river be great ride great achievement must be hungry a well a tired will tell man to get breakfast at once can eat while read despatch then may have few question to ask after that have better turn in till evening gregory enjoyed breakfast with luxury of tinned fruit after rough fare for past fortnight when went to general room again latter said colonel parson despatch be very full think quite understand situation praise be too high for conduct of officer troop seemed to have behaved equally well mention gallant part took in defence of baggage with captain ruthven doctor only thirty four soldier of camel corp

necessary to carry up supply for troop colonel collinson who be in command pushed forward at once with th soudanese camel corp when fadil heard of approach made night attack on gedareh however be easily repulsed by garrison then broke up camp marched away intending to cross blue nile join khalifa troop be greatly demoralized by failure in spite of precaution took darfur sheik with five hundred of men succeeded in effecting escape at once joined actively in further operation against fadil a there be further danger soudanese marched back again joined other battalion garrison on river be re established part of force returned to omdurman sirdar have returned from fashoda before gregory came back have left almost immediately for cairo on day after gregory return have sharp attack of fever

afternoon at eleven at night halted at little village at three in morning again advanced at eight o'clock came in contact with dervish outpost colonel lewis have already learned that instead of dervish force having crossed only one division have done so that have by far greater part of fadil army opposed to be serious matter to attack four five thousand men with so small force at disposal for have th soudanese handful of th two maxim gun a to darfur irregular great reliance must be placed upon a force issued from wood through have be marching saw river in front of in midst rose large island mile quarter long more than three quarter of mile wide there be clump of sand hill upon have learned that intervening stream be rapid not deep while on other side of island be very deep with

fallen in battle be down with fever colonel wingate took a assistant time be now spent in listening to story of tribesman who a soon a khalifa force have passed have brought in very varying account of strength then there be villager who have complaint to make of robbery of ill usage for arab irregular who have be disbanded after capture of omdurman be largely responsible besides there be many petition by fugitive who have returned to find house occupied land seized by others gregory be constantly sent off to investigate decide in dispute be sometimes away for week at time zaki have recovered rapidly a soon a be able to rise accompanied master who obtained valuable assistance from a while gregory be hearing story of witness zaki went quietly about village talking to old men woman frequently obtained evidence that showed that many of witness be perjured so enabled master to give decision astonished people by justness indeed report of extraordinary manner in seemed able to pick out truth from falsehood to decide in favour of rightful claimant spread so rapidly from village to village that claimant who came in to colonel wingate often requested urgently that young bimbashi must be sent out to investigate matter seem to be attaining position of modern solomon hilliard colonel said one day with smile how do do gregory laughed told manner in got at truth excellent plan said one must be well to adopt generally by sending men beforehand to village only objection be that must not rely much more upon report of spy than on of villager chance be that claimant who must bid highest must receive support matter be quiet until sirdar returned from england determined to make attempt to capture khalifa whose force be reported not to exceed one thousand men two squadron of

khalifa wide tract have be cleared of bush great multitude of dwelling constructed of spear grass stretched away for mile at very lowest compilation have contained twenty thousand people of be calculated that from eight thousand to ten thousand must have be fighting men ten time a many a have before be reported to be with khalifa reconnaissance showed that large army be waiting to give battle on hill be of great strength surrounded by deep ravine pool of water position be anxious one total force be about fourteen hundred strong defeat must mean annihilation while even victory must scarcely secure capture of khalifa who with principal emir osman digna el khatim sheik of el obeid sheik ed din fadil must be able to gallop off if saw battle going against colonel kitchener have wisdom to decide against risking destruction of follower by assault against so great force posted in so strong position be deep mortification to to have to retreat soldier be bitterly disappointed commander felt brave a egyptian soudanese have shown odds against victory be too great after terrible march great suffering from thirst scanty food force reached koli on th of february be conveyed in steamer down to omdurman after somewhat unfortunate affair naturally added to prestige of khalifa month passed uneventfully late in october preparation be made for attack upon large scale against khalifa camp eight thousand men be concentrated at karla on white nile be known that khalifa be at gedir eighty mile away after proceeding distance be found that have marched away column returned a pursuit through densely wooded country must have be impracticable gunboat have gone up river with flying column under colonel lewis to check of khalifa force attempted to establish on bank mounted troop transport be at once concentrated colonel wingate be sent up to take command force consisted of brigade of infantry under colonel lewis with th th soudanese irregular soudanese battalion company of nd egyptian six company of camel corp squadron of cavalry field battery six maxim detachment of medical supply department with camel transport train to carry ration three day water in three thousand seven hundred men on afternoon of st of november column moved forward favoured by bright moonlight made march of fifteen mile cavalry scouting two mile in front flank rear being covered by camel corp native report have brought in information that fadil who have be raiding country be now in neighbourhood on way to rejoin main dervish army be lying near cavalry pushed forward at dawn found that fadil have retreated leaving quantity of grain behind sick dervish who have remained there said that dervish have moved to point seven mile away cavalry camel corp of gun advanced seized position within three hundred yard of dervish encampment on immediately opened fire rest of gun be at once pushed forward to reinforce arrived in time to assist in repulsing fierce attack of dervish owing to nature of ground be able to approach to within sixty yard of gun before coming under fire be then mowed down by gun maxim musketry fire of camel corp to be added that of infantry brigade when arrived be too much even for dervish valour to withstand fled back to camp british force then advanced met with little opposition a entered camp saw enemy in full flight infantry followed for mile half while cavalry camel corp kept up pursuit for five mile fadil camp containing large amount of grain other store fell into hand of captor with number of prisoner including woman child animal four hundred dervish have fallen great number have be wounded while british casualty amounted to native officer of camel corp dangerously wounded one man killed three wounded gregory have accompanied colonel wingate acted a one of staff officer have of course brought horse with be excellent animal have be used by in excursion from omdurman be rather different affair from fight on atbara zaki said when force gathered in fadil camp after pursuit be relinquished dervish fought just a bravely in one case have strong position to defend while today took offensive make difference be glad to have seen fighting again master for have be dull work stopping ten month in omdurman with nothing to do ride about country decide upon villager quarrel have be useful work zaki consider very fortunate in being so constantly employed be desperately afraid that colonel wingate must leave there be greatly relieved when told be to come with be fortunate thing that have beaten old enemy fadil here in first place because if three four thousand men have with have joined khalifa must have given harder work in tomorrow fight in next place arrival with follower who have escaped at khalifa camp be not likely to inspirit dervish there gregory be occupied afternoon in examining prisoner affirmed that have left former camp three day before with intention of proceeding to gedid where fadil be to join khalifa with captured grain when whole dervish force be to march north troop slept during afternoon in evening set out for gedid reached at ten o'clock next morning dervish deserter reported that khalifa be encamped seven mile to southeast fortunately pool with sufficient water for whole force be found at gedid be matter of great importance for otherwise expedition must have fallen back be hoped that khalifa must now stand at bay a occupation of gedid barred advance north behind be waterless densely wooded district capture of grain on have relied must render impossible for to remain long in present position only chance of extricating be to stand fight after twelve hour rest troop be roused started few minute after midnight transport be left under strong guard near water with order to follow four hour later cavalry with two maxim moved in advance camel corp on flank ground be thickly wooded in many place way have to be cut for gun at three o'clock news be received from cavalry that enemy camp be three mile distant from point infantry have reached that maxim have halted two mile ahead at foot of slightly rising ground beyond scout have on previous day discovered main force of enemy to be stationed infantry continued to advance slowly cautiously making a little noise a possible be soon evident however that in spite of caution enemy be aware of approach a there be outburst of beating of drum blowing of war horn did not last long be enough to show that dervish be not to be taken by surprise when infantry reached spot where cavalry be halted latter scout be withdrawn infantry picket thrown out troop then lay down to await daybreak officer chatted together in low tone there be two hour till dawn with prospect of heavy fighting before none be inclined to sleep question be whether dervish must defend camp attack result of battle of omdurman must have taught that be impossible to come to close quarter in face of terrible fire of rifle fadil must give experience at gedareh must teach same lesson on other hand storming of dervish camp on atbara fight at rosaires must seem to show that assault of egyptian force be irresistible a gregory have be present at four of battle be asked to give opinion think that will attack said dervish leader rely upon enthusiasm of follower in almost battle have fought here have rushed forward to assault be so in fight down by red sea be so in attack on lord wolseley desert column succeeded against hick baker force even now seem to have recognized that egyptian whom once despised have quite got over dread of

be attacking force firing increased in volume be evidently approaching picket then be being driven in dervish be going to attack men be ordered to lie down in position in be to fight in five minute after first shot be ready for action picket have run in in dim light number of dark figure must be made out gun maxim at once spoke out while infantry fired volley be still too dark to make out movement of enemy reply to fire came louder louder on left be apparent that intention of dervish be to turn flank of position colonel wingate sent gregory to order gun to turn fire more in direction other officer ordered right to advance somewhat while left be slightly thrown back pushed out light be now getting brighter heavy body of dervish shouting firing rushed forward be mown down by grape from gun storm of maxim bullet steady volley of infantry wavered for moment then gradually fell back bugle sounded advance with cheer whole line moved forward down gentle slope quickening pace a enemy retired before still keeping up heavy fire towards clump of tree concealed dervish camp from sight enemy fire have now died out at twenty five minute past six cease fire be sounded a troop advanced be evident that resistance be at end a issued through tree many dervish ran forward surrendered thousand of woman child be found in camp happily none of have be injured a slight swell in ground have

earl have gone into trade made considerable fortune so that young fellow be great deal better off than vast majority of men in army be air gave on strength of being able to indulge in expenditure such a one else in regiment must attempt by keeping three four race horse in training other folly have more to do with unpopularity than constant talk about peerage be so confident of getting of course
