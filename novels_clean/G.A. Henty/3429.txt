of virtue be parent of almost others since few of can be practised without courage of forefather have created greatest empire in world around small in insignificant island if empire be ever lost will be by cowardice of descendant at period of history did england stand so high in eye of europe a in time whose event be recorded in volume chivalrous king even more chivalrous prince have infected whole people with martial spirit result be that army be for time invincible most astonishing success be gained against number must appear overwhelming victory of cressy poitier may be to extent accounted for by superior generalship discipline on part of conqueror will not account for great naval victory over spanish fleet off coast of sussex victory even more surprising won against greater odds than be gained in same water century later over spanish armada historical fact of story be drawn from froissart other contemporary historian a collated compared by mr james in carefully written history may therefore be relied upon a accurate in important particular yours sincerely g henty chapter wayfarer be bitterly cold night in month of november rain be pouring heavily when woman with child in arm entered little village of southwark have evidently come from distance for dress be travel stained muddy tottered rather than walked when upon arrival at gateway on southern side of london bridge found that hour be past gate closed for night leant against wall with faint groan of exhaustion disappointment after remaining a if in doubt for time feebly made way into village here be many house of entertainment for traveler like often arrived too late to enter gate have to abide outside for night moreover house rent be dear within wall of crowded city many whose business brought to town found cheaper to take up abode in quiet hostel of southwark rather than to stay in more expensive inn within wall light came out brightly from many of casement with sound of boisterous song laughter woman passed without pause presently stopped before cottage from feeble light alone showed that be tenanted knocked at door be opened by pleasant faced man of thirty year old what be asked be wayfarer woman answered feebly canst take child in for night have made mistake man said be inn further up road there be plenty of place where can find such accommodation a lack have passed woman said seemed full of roisterer be wet weary strength be nigh spent can pay thee good fellow pray a christian to let come in sleep before fire for night when gate be open in morning will go for have friend within city who will methinks receive tone of voice addressing of a good fellow at once convinced man that woman before be common wayfarer come in said geoffrey ward be not man to shut door in woman face on night like doe need payment for such small hospitality come hither madge shouted at voice woman came down from upper chamber sister said be wayfarer who need shelter for night be wet weary do

quick madge get wet thing off be soaked to skin will go round to green dragon will fetch cup of warm cordial warrant will put fresh life into so saying took down flat cap from peg on wall went out while sister at once proceeded to remove drenched garment to rub cold hand of guest until recovered consciousness when geoffrey ward returned woman be sitting in settle by fireside dressed in warm woolen garment belonging to sister madge have thrown fresh wood on fire be blazing brightly now woman drank steaming beverage host brought with colour came faintly again into cheek thank indeed said for kindness have not taken in think must have died at door for indeed must go further though hold not to life yet must fain live until have delivered boy into hand of who will be kind to will trust be tomorrow say nought about geoffrey answered madge be right glad to have be of service to must be poor world indeed if one must not give corner of one fireside to fellow creature on night a especially when fellow creature be woman with child poor little chap look right well sturdy seems to have taken ill from journey truly be well sturdy mother said looking at proudly indeed have be almost wishing today that be lighter by few pound for in truth be not used to carry far weight have sorely tried name be walter trust added looking at powerful figure of host that will grow up a straight a stalwart a child who be about three year old be indeed exceedingly fine little fellow a sat in one scanty garment in mother lap gazing with round eye at blazing fire smith thought how pretty picture child mother made be fair gentle looking girl two twenty year old be easy enough to see now from delicate feature soft shapely hand that have never be accustomed to toil now smith said will e'en say good night hour be late will be having watch coming along to know why keep fire so long after curfew must be stranger in city will gladly act a guide in morning to friend whom seek be must be known to if not will doubtless find without difficulty so saying smith retired to bed of rush in smithy soon afterwards tired visitor with baby lay down on rush in front of fire for in day none of working artisan class used bed be not indeed for century afterwards in usage by common people in morning geoffrey ward found that guest desired to find one giles fletcher maker of bow know well smith said there be many who do larger business hold head higher giles fletcher be well esteemed a good workman whose ware can be depended upon be often said of did take le pain must thrive more handle bow that make a if loved finish polish with own hand therefore doeth not so much trade a who be le particular with ware for hath to charge high price to be able to live none who have ever bought bow have regretted silver cost many many gross of arrowhead have sold be well nigh a particular in make a be over spring temper of own bow many friendly wrangle have have with over weight finish be not many who find fault with handiwork though say now madam be at service during night wayfarer clothes have be dried cloak be of rough quality such a might have be used by peasant woman rest though of sombre colour be of good material fashion seeing that kind entertainer must be hurt by offer of money lady contented with thanking madge warmly saying that hoped to come across bridge one day with dame fletcher then under guidance of geoffrey who insisted on carrying boy set out from smith cottage passed under outer gate across bridge later on be covered with double line of house shop be now narrow structure over gateway across river upon pike be number of head human limb lady shuddered a looked up be ugly sight smith said can see warrant for such exposure of dead there be head of wallace of three of robert bruce brother of many other valiant scotsman who fought against king twenty year back after fought for country just a harold ancestor against norman under william think foul shame that men who have done other harm must be beheaded still le that head limb must be stuck up there gibbering at passer by there be over score of fresh trouble add to number pardon said suddenly a sob from figure by side called attention from head on top of gateway be rough heedless in speech a sister madge doe often tell may well be have said something wounded meant ill lady replied be own thought trouble drew tear from say not more about pray passed under gateway with ghastly burden be soon in crowded street of london high overhead house extended story advancing beyond below until occupier of attic must well nigh shake hand across soon left more crowded street turning to right after ten minute walking smith stopped in front of bowyer shop near aldgate be shop said there be giles fletcher trying spring pull of one of bow here will leave will one of day return to inquire if health have taken ought of harm by rough buffeting of storm of yester even so saying handed child to mother with wave of hand took leave not waiting to listen to renewed thanks late guest endeavoured to give shop be open in front projecting penthouse sheltered from weather two three bow lay upon wide shelf in front several large sheaf of arrow tied together stood by wall powerful man of forty year old be standing in middle of shop with bent bow in arm taking aim at spot in wall through open door three men must be seen in inner workshop cutting shaping wood for bow bowyer looked round a visitor entered shop then with sudden exclamation lowered bow hush giles lady exclaimed be name name be best that none knew here craftsman closed door of communication into inner room lady alice exclaimed in low tone here in such guise surely be lady sighed although sometimes be well nigh inclined to ask whether be truly not whether be not dreadful dream have heard vaguely of trouble giles fletcher said hoped that rumour be false ever since duke of kent be executed air have be full of rumour then came news of killing of mortimer of imprisonment of king mother be said that many who be thought to be of party have be attacked slain heard there stopped heard rightly good giles be true week after slaying of mortimer band of knight men at arm arrived at castle demanded admittance in king name sir roland refused for have news that many be taking up arm be useless castle be attacked after three day fighting be taken roland be killed be cast out with child afterwards repented that have let go searched far wide for be hidden in cottage of woodcutter be too busy in hunting down others whom proclaimed to be enemy of king a have wrongfully said of roland who have done duty faithfully to queen isabella be assuredly enemy of son although might well be opposed to weak indolent king father however when search relaxed borrowed cloak of good man wife set out for london whither have traveled on foot believing that bertha must take in shelter in great need aye will willingly giles said be not bertha nurse to whom must come if not to will please to mount stair for bertha will not forgive if keep talking down here what joy will be to to see again so saying giles led way to apartment above there be scream of surprise joy from wife then giles quietly withdrew downstairs again leaving woman to cry in other arm few day later geoffrey ward entered shop of giles fletcher have brought twenty score of arrowhead master giles said have be longer in hand than be usual with have be pressed how go with lady whom brought to door last week sadly master ward very sadly a told when came across to thank again in name own for kindness to be in poor plight after journey poor thing be little accustomed to such wet hardship doubtless took more effect because be low in spirit weakened with much grieving night be taken with sort of fever hot cold by turn at time off head since then have lain in high fever doe not know even wife thought ever go back to storming of castle cry aloud begs to spare lord life be pitiful to hear leech give small hope for life in troth master ward methinks that god must deal most gently with be to take heart be already in husband grave for be ever of most loving faithful nature here there must be little comfort for must fret that boy must never inherit land of father although know well enough that must be always welcome here that bertha must serve a gladly faithfully a ever did when be nurse yet must not greatly feel change be tenderly brought up being a told last week only daughter of sir harold broome brother who year ago became lord of broomecastle at death of father be one of queen men be believe who brought sir roland somers to side be slain on same night a mortimer land like of sir roland have be seized by crown child upstairs be by right heir to estate seeing that uncle died unmarried will doubtless be conferred upon who have aided young king in freeing from mother domination for indeed although lament that lady alice must have suffered so sorely in doing of blame not at be noble prince will make great king doings of mother have be shame to however meddle not in politics if poor lady dy a methinks be well nigh certain bertha will bring up boy a own have talked over with wife so far be not of one mind think will be best to keep in ignorance of birth lineage since knowledge can not benefit will render discontented with lot make disinclined to take to calling in might otherwise earn living rise to be respected citizen bertha hath notion have not taken wife to yourself master geoffrey must know that woman oft have fancy wander widely from hard fact say must have brought up a man at arm so that may do valiant deed win back day title honour of family geoffrey ward laughed trust woman for being romantic said however master fletcher need not for present trouble about child calling even must mother die at rate whether follows trade whether blood in vein lead to take to martial deed knowledge of arm may well be of use to promise that such skill a have will teach when grows old enough to wield sword battle axe a know may without boasting say that must scarce have better master seeing have for three year carried away prize for best sword player at sport methinks boy will grow up into strong stalwart man for be truly splendid lad a to archery need not go far to learn since apprentice will parker last year won prize a best marksman in city bound trust if taste lie way will between turn out rare man at arm must stand gossiping no longer rumour that be likely ere long to have war with france have rarely bettered trade since war in scotland men arm have rusted somewhat two men be hard at work mending armour fitting sword to hilt forging pike head see be citizen though dwell outside bound because house rent be cheaper get charcoal without paying city due so can work somewhat lower than in wall have good custom from many in kent who know that arm be of a good temper a turned out by craftsman in city giles be anticipation a to result of guest illness turned out to be well founded fever abated left prostrate in strength for few week lingered seemed to have little hold of life to care not whether lived died so gradually faded away know will take care of boy a if be own bertha said one day husband will be far better protector for than must have be have lived teach to be honest true be better methinks that grew up thinking father mother for otherwise may grow discontented with lot leave with must speak keep silent according a see disposition mind if be content to settle down to peaceful life here say nought to must unsettle mind if walter turn out to have adventurous disposition then tell a much a think fit of history not encouraging to hope to recover father land mine for can never be seeing that before time can come must have be enjoyed for many year by others that may learn to bear bravely gently a becomes one of good blood few day later lady alice breathed last at own request be buried quietly without pomp a if have be child of bowman plain stone with name dame alice somers marking grave boy grew throve until at fourteen year old there be stronger sturdier lad of age within city bound giles have caused to be taught to read write accomplishment be common among citizen although be until long afterwards rare among warlike baron greater part of time however be spent in sport with lad of own age in moorfields beyond wall war with france be now raging a be natural boy in game imitated doings of elder mimic battle ofttimes growing into earnest be fought between lad of different ward walter fletcher a be known among play fellow have by strength courage won for proud position of captain of boy of ward of aldgate geoffrey ward have kept word have already begun to give lad lesson in use of arm when not engaged otherwise walter must almost afternoon cross london bridge must spend hour in armourer forge geoffrey business have grown for war have caused great demand for arm have now six men working in forge a soon a boy must handle light tool geoffrey allowed to work although not able to wield heavy sledge walter be able to do much of finer work geoffrey encouraged in a in first place use of tool greatly strengthened boy muscle gave acquaintance with arm moreover geoffrey be still bachelor thought that boy whom a well a giles have come to love a son might must not take up trade of war prefer occupation of armourer to of bowmaker in case must take day a partner in forge after work be over men have gone away geoffrey must give lad instruction in use of arm at have be at work so quick strong be that rapidly acquired use geoffrey foresaw that must one day must thought turn way prove mighty man at arm be knowledge acquired from geoffrey have much to do with walter position among comrade skill strength have acquired in wielding hammer by practice with sword rendered formidable opponent with stick formed weapon in mimic battle indeed not few be complaint be brought before giles fletcher of bruise hurt caused by be too turbulent walter bowyer said one day when haberdasher from ward of aldersgate came to complain that son head have be badly cut by blow with club from walter fletcher be always getting into trouble be becoming terror of other boy why do not play more quietly feud between boy of different ward be becoming serious nuisance many injury have be inflicted hear that matter have be mentioned in common council that there be talk of issuing order that boy not yet apprenticed to trade will be allowed to carry club that found doing so will be publicly whipped want to be turbulent walter said if aldersgate boy will defy be to do hit harder than can help if jonah harris must leave head unguarded must not help hitting tell wo do walter giles said will be getting into sore trouble be growing too masterful altogether have none of quiet demeanour peaceful air becomes honest citizen in six month will be apprenticed then hope will hear more of doings father be talking of apprenticing master geoffrey walter said that evening hope that will a be good enough to promise talk with about apprenticing to craft rather than to must never take to making of bow though indeed like well to use will parker who be teaching say that show rare promise must never be to taste to stand day sawing smoothing polishing one bow be to much like though father hold that there be rare difference between be nobler craft to work on iron next to using arm most pleasant thing surely be to make one can fancy what good blow sword will give what hard knock armour will turn aside day master geoffrey when have served time mean to follow army there be always work there for armourer to do sometimes at pinch may even get share of fighting walter did not venture to say that must prefer to be man at arm for such sentiment must be deemed a outrageous in ear of quiet city craftsman a must proposal of son of such man nowadays to enlist a soldier armourer smiled knew well enough what be in walter mind have cost geoffrey hard struggle to settle down to craft deemed natural that with knightly blood flowing in walter vein must long to distinguish in field said nothing of however renewed promise to speak to giles fletcher deeming that few year passed in forge must be best preparation walter must have for career a soldier chapter ii hut in marsh week later party of knight court gallant riding across field without wall checked horse to look at struggle be going on between two party of boy one be apparently most powerful have driven other off from heap of rubbish have be carried without wall party have flag attached to stick boy be armed with club such a carried by apprentice boy many of carried mimic shield made of wood have stuffed flat cap with wool shaving better to protect head from blow smaller party have just be driven from heap leader be urging to make effort to regain be gallant looking lad sturdy lord de vaux boy of about ten year of age said bear like young knight have have hard knock for see blood be streaming down face one must scarcely expect to see varlet of city playing so roughly citizen have proved sturdy fighter before now prince other said be ever independent hold to right even against king contingent city sends to war bear a well a of of baron see boy interrupted be going to charge again leader have seized flag have swung shield behind just a knight might do if leading stormers against place of strength let stop till see end of with shout of aldgate aldgate leader of assailant dashed forward followed by comrade with rush reached top of heap well done young prince exclaimed clapping hand see how lay about with club of there have knocked down leader of defender a if club have be battle axe well done young sir well done follower waver others be too strong for stand coward rally round leader in enthusiasm young prince urged horse forward to scene of conflict assailant be mastered few of must gain top of heap who did so be beaten back from by defender heavy blow be exchanged blood flowed freely from many of head face for in day boy thought le than do now of hard knock manliness courage be considered first of virtue leader however still stood ground on crest though hardly pressed on side used club to strike parry with skill aroused warmest admiration on part of prince in vain follower attempted to come to rescue time struggled up heap be beaten back again by on crest yield thee prisoner assailant of leader shouted prince in excitement echoed cry lad however heard heeded not still kept flag aloft in left hand with sudden spring struck down one of opponent plucked up flag from ground then fought way back through foe to edge of battleground then heavy blow struck on temple still holding flag rolled senseless to foot of heap defender with shout of triumph be rushing down when prince urged horse forward cease said authoritatively enough have be done young master sport be becoming broil hitherto lad absorbed in strife have paid little heed to party of onlooker at word at once arrested arm baring head stood still in confusion harm be done prince said though sport be of roughest fear that leader be hurt move not lift head from ground boy be indeed still insensible lord prince said to knight who have now ridden up fear that boy be badly hurt be gallant lad have spirit of true knight in citizen son though be lord de vaux will bid squire ride at full speed to tower tell master roger leech to come here with haste to bring such nostrum a may be needful for restoring boy to life tower be mile distant before master roger arrived walter have already recovered consciousness be just sitting up when leech hurried up to spot have arrived too late master roger prince said doubt not that dose of cordial may yet be of use for be still dazed blow got must have cracked skull have be thin one leech poured cordial from vial into small silver cup held to boy lip be potent nigh took breath away when have drunk struggled to foot looking ashamed confused when saw centre of attention of so many knight of court what be thy name good lad prince asked be known a walter fletcher be brave lad prince said if bear a well a man a did now must wish better to ride beside in day of battle must time ever come when tire of peaceable life of citizen wish to take service in war go to tower ask boldly for prince of wale will enroll among own men at arm promise that will have share of fighting a stark a of assault of yon heap now lord let ride on crave pardon for having so long detained walter be day before must again cross london bridge to inform friend geoffrey of honour have befallen of being addressed by prince of wale during interval be forced to lie abed be soundly rated by master giles for again getting into mischief geoffrey be far more sympathetic said well walter although must not that gaffer giles heard say so think have have piece of rare good fortune may be that may never have cause to recall young prince promise to must day decide to embrace calling of arm must wish for nothing better than to ride behind prince of wale be by account of most noble generous disposition be said young a be to be already highly skilled in arm men say that will be wise king gallant captain one a brave soldier might be proud to follow a king will be sure to give plenty of opportunity of distinguishing who ride with may be certain of chance of doing valorous deed will go across bridge tomorrow will have talk with master fletcher sooner be apprenticed sooner will be out of time since madge married eight year since have be lonely in house will be glad to have with geoffrey ward found friend more ready to accede to request that walter must be apprenticed to than have expected bowyer indeed be quiet man high spirit somewhat turbulent disposition of young charge gave so much uneasiness that be not sorry responsibility of keeping in order must be undertaken by geoffrey moreover must not agree with argument that promise of prince of wale offered more favourable opportunity for walter to enter upon career of arm so perhaps someday to win way back to rank honour than must have be looked for therefore on following week walter be indentured to armourer a be usual at time left abode in aldgate took up residence with master threw with whole heart into work by time be fifteen be on way to become skilful craftsman frame muscle developed with labour be now able to swing save very heaviest hammer in shop have never abated in practice at arm day when work be over master have long bout together with cudgel quarterstaff sword axe walter of course used light weapon so quick be with geoffrey ward acknowledged that needed to put out skill to hold own with pupil be not alone with geoffrey walter have opportunity of learning use of arm whenever soldier returned from war came to have weapon repaired by armourer must be sure of invitation to come in in evening take stoup of ale tell of battle siege have gone through in course of evening must be asked to have bout of arm with young apprentice whom geoffrey represented a being eager to learn how to use sword a well a how to make thus walter became accustomed to different style of fighting found that very few indeed of visitor be nearly so well skilled with arm a master of soldier be mortified at finding unable to hold own with boy others must take revers in good part must come again bringing with comrade known to be particularly skilled with weapon to try temper of armourer apprentice at age of fifteen walter have won prize at sport for best cudgel play best sword buckler play among apprentice to great disgust of many who have almost reached age of manhood be just out of time on sunday walter always spent day with giles fletcher wife going to mass with walking in field where after service citizen much congregated since walter have gone to work have taken part in fight frolic of former comrade be in fact far too tired at end of day work to have desire to do aught to sit listen to tale of war of many old soldier who pervaded country of men be disabled by wound long service greater portion be idle scamp who cared not for hard blow suffering of campaign liking better to hang about tavern drinking at expense of to whom related fabulous tale of gallant action have performed many too wandered over country sometimes in two three sometimes in large band robbing often murdering traveler attacking lonely house when in one part ill deed became too notorious sheriff must call out posse of men must be hunted down like wild beast be not however easy to catch for great tract of forest still covered large portion of country afforded shelter in country round london pest be very numerous for here more than anywhere else be there chance of plunder swamp on south side of river have especially evil reputation from southwark to putney stretch marshy country over at high tide river frequently flowed here there be wretched hut difficult of access affording good hiding place for pursued by justice since searcher must be seen approaching long way off escape must be made by path across swamp known only to dweller there where heavily armed men dared not follow further south in wild country round westerham where mile of heath forest stretched away in direction be noted place where robber vagrant mustered thickly sheriff of kent have much trouble with law in day be extremely severe death be penalty of caught plundering extreme severity of law however operated in favour of breaker since sympathy of people who have little to lose be with unless caught red handed in act must generally escape since none save who have be robbed must say aught must place pursuer on trace give testimony must cost life of fellow creature citizen of london be loud in complaint against discharged soldier for be upon that loss mainly fell be on petition to king that sheriff of middlesex hertford essex surrey kent be generally stirred up to put down ill doer sometimes hunt be conducted in wholesale way whole posse of county must be called out then found within limit who have not land visible occupation be collected against whom charge must be brought home be hung without more ado rest be put on board ship sent across sea to army sometimes when found country becoming too hot for men must take service with knight noble going to war anxious to take with a strong following a might be not too particular a to character of soldier walter being of adventurous spirit be sometimes wont of summer evening when work be done to wander across marsh taking with bow arrow often bringing home wild duck two shot in pool more than once surly men have accosted have threatened to knock on head if again found wandering way walter laughed at threat seeing that though apprentice lad might be able to send arrow a straight to mark a be content to leave alone one day when be well nigh in heart of swamp of lambeth saw figure making way across hour be already late night be falling appearance of man be so different from of usual denizen of swamp that walter wondered what business there might be scarcely knowing why did so walter threw down among low brushwood watched approaching figure when came near recognized face saw to surprise that be knight who have day before stopped at armourer shop to have two rivet put in hauberk have particularly noticed because of arrogant manner in spoke walter have put in rivet have thought a buckled on armour again how unpleasant countenance be that of wearer be tall powerful man must have be handsome have not eye be too closely set together nose be narrow expression of face reminded walter of hawk have now laid aside helmet figure be covered with long cloak be up to good walter said to for what dealing must knight honestly have with ruffian who haunt swamp be assuredly business of mine may lead to adventure have have real fun since left aldgate will follow see if can get to bottom of mystery when came close to spot where walter be lying knight paused looked round a if uncertain of way for four five minute stood still then gave shout of humphrey at top of voice be answered by distant hallo looking in direction from answer have come walter saw figure appear above bush four hundred yard distant knight at once directed step in direction walter crept cautiously after pest upon swamp quagmire knight said angrily a neared other why didst not meet show way through a before thought that a have come once must be able to find way hither again man said have thought that must have missed must have come ten time a far rather than have have name shouted over country however there be one to hear did shout thrice a loud so harm be done thought saw figure short time since knight said man looked round in direction see none said may have be mistaken for light be waning fast be ill for anyone caught prying about here come in sir knight hovel be not what lordship be accustomed to may a well talk there a here beneath sky two men disappeared from walter sight latter in much surprise crept forward until reached spot where have last seen speaker be unable to account for disappearance then saw that spot although apparently mere clump of bush higher than surrounding country be really elevated hummock of ground anyone might have passed close to bush without suspecting aught lay among in centre however ground have be cut away low doorway almost hidden by bush gave access into half subterranean roof be formed of old boat turned bottom upwards have be covered with brown turf be excellent place of concealment a searcher might have passed within foot of bush without suspecting aught lay concealed within clever hiding place walter thought to wonder posse search swamp in vain be lowest wettest part of swamp must be lightly searched for none must suspect that there be human habitation among brown ditch stagnant pool to disappointment lad must hear nothing of conversation be going on within hut murmur of voice came to ear word be audible however remained patiently thinking perhaps a came out word might be said must give clue to object of mysterious interview between knight one who be evidently fugitive from justice patience be rewarded in half hour waited night have fallen thick fog be rising over swamp rendered difficult to discern anything at distance of few pace be quite sure that can manage voice said a two men issued from hut there be difficulty in managing other replied if boat be punctual to hour named will be getting dusk then if one boat run into one need be surprised such accident will happen will be here just before other said will know boat by white mantle lady will wear reward will be fifty piece of gold of have received ten a earnest can trust if job be well done will take count of earnest money may consider a good a done other replied if boat be there matter be settled now will lead back across swamp must not give much for life if tried to find way alone who must have thought when got off from being hung after little affair at bruges must be able to make useful to worship may be sure knight replied that be just because foresaw that might be useful opened door of cell that night be always handy in time like to be able to lay one hand on man whom can hang if choose to open mouth did not strike sir knight that might enter mind that must be very advisable for to free from one who stand towards in relation certainly did knight replied a happen to be able to make for interest to serve that matter did not trouble knew better than to bring money into swamp of yours when might be attacked by dozen ruffian like took precaution of informing peter captain of men at arm of spot to be going bidding in case came not back to set hue cry on foot hunt down who might be found here with especial description of worthy self walter must hear no more have taken off shoe followed at distance voice still acted a guide to through swamp feared to keep too close a although darkness must conceal figure might at moment tread in pool ditch so betray presence putting foot time to ground with greatest caution moved quietly after spoke little more heavy footstep on swampy ground be sufficient guidance for at last ceased suddenly few word be spoken then heard returning step drew aside few foot crouched down saw dim figure pas through mist then resumed way ground be firmer now replacing shoe walked briskly on a neared higher ground along road ran heard two horseman galloping away in distance now turned face east after hour walking reached armourer why walter be late smith said men be in bed hour more can scarce keep awake where hast thou be boy have be in swamp lost way walter replied be bad neighbourhood lad worse be people who live there if have way whole posse must be called out marsh searched from end to end found there must be knocked on head thrown into own ditch there must be fear of honest man coming to end thereby now to bed lad can tell about tomorrow have rare day work before fire must be alight at daybreak on way back walter have debated with whether to inform master of what have happened be however bent upon having adventure on own account be serious thing in day for apprentice lad to bring accusation against noble city must not indeed allow even apprentice to be overridden although geoffrey ward forge stood beyond city wall be yet within liberty city allowing craftsman to open shop just outside gate to enjoy same privilege a if dwelling actually within wall on following afternoon walter asked leave to cease work hour earlier than usual a wished to go across into city armourer be surprised since be first time that thing have happened since lad have worked for be up to walter mischief will be bound go lad have worked so steadily

mount upon lad face a made half step backwards before saw have thought of offering purse of gold although must poorly reward service must yet have proved useful to when time came for to start a craftsman on own account now have seen feel that although there be few who think demeaned by accepting gift of money in reward for service must rather gratitude took other form can only do of offering such good service can render with earl talbot must ever choose profession of arm in meantime a memento of life have saved will be sure not refuse chain took very handsome one of gold from neck more so since be gift of majesty gracious queen to myself will be sure acquit of parting with gift when tell transferred to one who have saved life of myself daughter who be too proud to accept other

king might have assigned edith to a lord guardian be certain to give hand a reward for valour in field may well be to man with whom must be le happy than with 'prentice lad there need not be troubling about matter be five six year distant yet still thought that edith be ward of crown that hand must go where king will often trouble however have good friend in queen who will know exert what influence have in getting good husband for child even for have fear since king hinted when last saw that be time looked out for mate for vassal of westerham hyde needed lord to lead in field however hope that answer that be always at service under leading of cousin james will suffice for now what be to do in matter who must have thought that so coveted land that must have slain edith to posse of own land thrice a broad a mine though men say that have dipped deeply into owes much money to jew be powerful have many friend although earl talbot must stand by yet unsupported word of apprentice boy be poor evidence on to charge powerful baron of such crime a be best methinks to say nought about to bury thought in own heart nevertheless will not fail to take precaution lad advised to let sir james know that there be who have knowledge of handiwork hear cross sea tomorrow to join army may be long ere return will have plenty of time to consider how have best shape conduct towards on return assuredly will never be friendly with again frighten edith with kiss well walter have be dreadful business a expected armourer asked lad when re entered shop great folk have not eaten at rate have not be

bright eye will grow brighter at success geoffrey be talking surely at random lady edith vernon be child very beautiful child added reverently such that when grows up bravest knight in england might be proud to win what folly for son of city bowyer a yet apprentice to raise mine eye so high higher one look higher one go armourer said sententiously aspire day to become knight may well aspire also to win hand of mistress edith vernon be five year younger than will be twenty two when be seventeen have time to make way yet tell though why matter not must rather set heart on winning mistress edith vernon than other heiress of broad land in merry england have saved life so have made first step long one be ever brave gentle honourable tell need not despair now lad have already lost too much time in talking let to work that evening walter recalled to geoffrey promise to tell cause have involved england in so long bloody war with france be tangled skein geoffrey said must follow carefully first with piece of chalk will draw upon wall pedigree of royal line of france from phillip downwards then will see how be that king edward phillip of valois came to be rival claimant to throne of france now see that king edward be nephew of charles le bel last king of france while phillip of valois be only nephew of phillip le bel father of charles edward be consequently in direct line have isabella be man instead of woman right to throne must be unquestionable in france however there be law called bealic law excludes female from throne be maintained by many learned in law although female be held to be incompetent to reign because from sex can not lead army to battle yet way forfeit otherwise right that son be therefore heir to throne if contention be held by english jurist by many in france also be well founded edward be rightful king of france phillip of valois contends that bealic law ' not only bar female from ascending throne also destroys right that succession go not to son to next heir male in case of course phillip be rightful king be not for to say view be right one certainly great majority of who have be consulted have decided that according to ancient law usage right lie with edward in matter 'right be not always might ' have isabella married french noble instead of english king be probable that son claim to throne must have be allowed without dispute son be king of england french noble prefer being ruled by one of to becoming united with england under one king at time of death of last king edward be still boy under tuition of mother phillip be man upon spot therefore be able to win support by presence promise so came that peer of france declared phillip of valois to be rightful monarch here in england at parliament held at right of edward be discussed asserted bishop of worcester coventry be despatched to paris to protest against validity of phillip nomination a however country be not in position to enforce claim of young king by arm phillip became firmly seated a king of france having shown great energy in at once marching against repressing people of flanders who be in state of rebellion against count one of feudatory of french crown noble be well satisfied with choice question a to right be ever henceforth raised in france a soon a rebellion in flanders be crushed phillip summoned king of england to do homage for aquitaine ponthieu montreuil fief held absolutely from crown of france such proceeding placed edward council in great embarrassment in case of refusal whole of possession of crown in france might be declared forfeited be seized while england be in condition to defend on other hand fact of doing homage to phillip of valois must be sort of recognition of right to throne have assumed have edward then held rein of power in hand there can be little doubt that must at once have refused must have called out whole strength of england to enforce claim influence of isabella mortimer be however powerful be agreed that edward must do homage a public act making private reservation in secret to own councillor taking exception to right of phillip edward crossed to france journeyed to amiens where phillip with brilliant court awaited on appointed day appeared together in cathedral here edward under certain protestation did homage for french estate leaving certain term question open for consideration of council for time matter remained in shape honest men can not admit that king edward did by action at time acknowledge phillip to be king of france that became vassal for estate there a have happened score of time before will doubt happen score of time again vassal when become powerful enough throw off allegiance to feudal superior so time came to king edward after death of mortimer imprisonment of isabella king gave rein to taste for military sport tournament be held at dartford other place one in westcheape what sight be that to be sure for three day king with fourteen of knight held list against comer in sight of citizen lady of court jousted with knight who came hither from part of europe be there day sight be grand one though england be well nigh thrown into mourning by accident took place gallery in queen attendant be viewing sport have be badly erected in height of contest gave way queen lady be in great peril being thrown from considerable height number of person be severely injured king who be furious at danger to queen have be exposed must have hung upon spot master workman whose negligence have caused accident queen went on knee before begged life of king love of edward for warlike exercise caused england to be regarded a most chivalrous court in europe frequent tournament aroused to utmost spirit of people prepared for war with france of event of war will tell other night be time now for to betake to bed chapter v city game next evening armourer at walter request continued narrative soon after tournament began to fight again with scotland for year have have peace with country under regency marriage be made between david king of scotland son of robert bruce princess joan sister to king four year truce be agreed to why must always be fighting with scotland walter asked be more than can tell walter be peaceful enough with until day of edward set up claim to throne of scotland right of anyone else so far a know have ever be able to make out fact be be strong thought that must conquer scotland quarrel between noble most of be allied by blood with own held possession in kingdom gave edward excuse to interfere scotland be conquered easily enough be hard task to hold sir william wallace kept country in turmoil for many year being joined by common people inflicted one heavy defeat upon at stirling receiving support from noble be defeated at falkirk year afterwards be captured executed here head may see day over london bridge a fought only for country have ever refused allegiance to king seems to that fate be cruel one then when appeared quiet robert bruce raised scotland again be crowned king there be war for many year at last at bannockburn inflicted defeat upon a have never have before after that there be skirmish excursion edward ii be weak prince seemed that marriage of david princess joan must bring about permanent peace between two country be not to be so many of english noble held claim by marriage grant upon land in scotland have of course be driven from when english be turned out by bruce by term of marriage treaty in be agreed that must be reinstated be foolish clause because be plain that king of scotland must not take land again from scotch noble who have possession of many of being well nigh a powerful a at time edward baliol son of great rival of robert bruce be in england still claimed throne of scotland a right round gathered number of english noble who claimed land in scotland king offered hindrance to gathering of force for doubt not that be glad to see dissension in scotland might give such pretext for interference a edward have seized to posse of country at first baliol be successful be crowned at scone be presently defeated driven out of scotland scot now made eruption across frontier a retaliation for edward having permitted baliol to gather force here for war against bruce king edward be on point of starting for ireland at once hastened north defeated scot at halidon hill captured berwick placed baliol upon throne bruce fled to france where be supported encouraged by french king ill feeling between edward phillip of valois have gone on increasing ever since former have be compelled to take oath of allegiance to latter outwardly guise of friendship be kept up negotiation went on between two court for marriage between little prince of wale joanna daughter of french king aid phillip gave to bruce increased bad feeling edward retaliated for phillip patronage of bruce by receiving with greatest honour courtesy robert of artois great feudatory of france who have be banished by king phillip for time although country be preparing for war peace be not broken a edward hand be full in scotland where baliol having bestowed immense possession upon english noble who have assisted country again rose in favour of bruce during three year followed king edward be obliged several time to go to scotland to support baliol who held crown a feudal vassal be always successful in field directly army recrossed frontier scotch rose again in new crusade be preached in october of year king phillip solemnly received cross collected immense army nominally for recovery of jerusalem whether intention be honest not can not say certainly king edward considered that phillip real aim in creating so great army be to attack england whether be so not must need wiser head than mine walter to tell certainly phillip of valois invited edward to cooperate with in crusade king in reply stated belief that preparation be intended for war in europe rather than in asia that if king of france must agree to conclude firm league of amity between two country to restore castle town of aquitaine whose surrender have be frequently promised never carried out must bind by oath to give assistance direct indirect to scotland must join in war for delivery of holy land must say that king edward demand be reasonable for be clear that must not march away from england with whole force leave baliol unsupported against assault of scotch enemy aided by france phillip be willing to accede to first two condition in regard to third positively declined treating until david bruce must be restored to throne of father now have french king openly supported bruce from first none must have said that conduct in befriending dethroned monarch be aught noble generous have along answered edward complaint of aid afforded by frenchman to bruce by denial that supported declaration in favour now certainly seemed to show that have at last determined openly to throw off veil that great army be really collected against england robert of artois craftily seized moment when king indignation against phillip be at highest at great banquet held by king edward at warlike noble be present robert entered preceded by two noble maiden carrying heron a know walter be considered most cowardly of bird then in loud tone called upon knight present to swear on bird to perform deed of chivalrous daring first presented to king edward giving to understand that regarded a little braver than heron for resigning without blow fair heritage of france moment be well chosen for edward be smarting under answer have just received from phillip at once rose took oath to enter france in arm to wait there month in order to give phillip time to offer battle to accept combat even must french outnumber ten to one knight present followed example of king so war with france have be for year mere question of time be at last suddenly decided upon walter can remember preparation be made throughout england men be enrolled arm prepared armourer be busy night day man felt that own honour a well a of country be concerned in winning for king heritage of have be unlawfully robbed by king of france on th of march at parliament at westminster king created little prince then seven year of age duke of cornwall prince immediately in exercise of new dignity bestowed upon twenty of most distinguished aspirant honour of knighthood immense supply be voted by parliament held at nottingham westminster northamton wool shorn in summer following be granted to king with variety of other tax custom duty revenue of foreign priory in england hundred ten in number be appropriated to crown provision of bacon wheat oat be granted king pawned own jewel even crown to hire soldier purchase ally on continent so great did scarcity of money become in country that good fell to le than value thus vast army be raised with king edward prepared to try strength with france phillip on part be making

fitted out by vassal on sea coast of normandy brittany picardy king edward have crossed over into belgium after vast delay in consequence of slowness of german ally at last prepared to enter france at end of september such lad be story a far a know of beginning of war with france be now raging whose event know a well a do seeing that be of late occurrence so far although english have have best of have sorely mauled french in north south have not gained such advantage a must lead to belief that there be likelihood of early termination that king edward will succeed for long time in winning back inheritance of throne of france there be doubt that war weighs heavily upon people at large tax be doubled drain of men be heavy armourer of course have busy time of trade have to do with furnishing of army flourish exceedingly moreover men of mettle valour have opportunity of showing what be composed of england ring with tale of martial deed there be walter who think that peace be greatest of blessing in way lad be doubt right there be many compensation in war brings out noble quality raise men to think that valour fortitude endurance honour be quality be something above mere huckstering desire for getting money for ignoble ease comfort day may be that world will change that war may become thing of past to mind boy doubt whether men will be happier better for priest doubt must tell otherwise then see be armourer so perhaps be hardly fair judge on matter seeing that without war craft must come to end walter remained in thought for time seems to master geoffrey while war may suit strong courageous men woman must rejoice be such thing to be at end woman suffer most from war doubt geoffrey said yet do mark that be more stirred by deed of valour chivalry than be men that be ever ready to bestow love upon who have won honour glory in war even although next battle may leave widow have be always somewhat of marvel to suppose that be human nature admiration for deed of valour bravery be ingrained in heart of man will continue until such time come that desire for wealth be ever on increase have so seized men that will look with distaste upon everything can interfere with making of money will regard man who amasses gold by trading a higher type than who doe valiant deed in battle surely that can never be walter said indignantly there be saying armourer answered at rate

opponent to surprise found that effort must not break down opponent guard walter indeed did not appear to take advantage of superior lightness activity to prefer to prove that in strength a well a skill be equal to antagonist in latter respect there be comparison for a soon a smith began to relax rain of blow took offensive with sweeping blow given with strength broke down opponent guard smote with such force upon steel cap blunted a sword be clove through iron stretched smith senseless on ground loud shout broke from assemblage marshal came up to walter removing helmet led to royal

rare craftsman one of day 't be rare pity so promising swordsman must be lost to army wouldst like to change calling boy take to of arm be hope to do so sir walter answered modestly grace prince of wale have already promised that will day ride behind to war ah edward king ejaculated how be have be already enlisting troop for war sir young prince replied one day now four year since when be riding with lord talbot others in field near tower did see lad lead play fellow to assault of earthen castle held by others fought so well gallantly that assuredly knight must have done better until be at last stricken senseless when recovered told must choose to be man at arm must enlist in following to war king laughed deemed not that lad of city indulged in such rough sport wonder not seeing that contingent good city of london furnishes be ever one of best in army will see lad at work again tomorrow will then talk more of now let bestow upon prize that have so well earned walter bent on one knee queen handed to sword of best spanish steel be prize given by city to victor king handed heavy purse of gold piece saying may aid in purchasing freedom walter bowed deeply murmured word of thanks be then led off by marshal after many of young noble of court jousted on horseback ran at ring performed other feat of knightly exercise to great pleasure of multitude marshal on leading walter away said to will be captain of city band tomorrow must therefore tell what king purport have prepared surprise for citizen present show will be different to anything ever before seen in london to show somewhat of siege be taking place on border of france low country in sir walter manny many other gallant knight have so greatly distinguished a exercise for young noble have determined that there will be castle erected will be built of wood with battlement tower with moat outside a soon a list be over large number of workman will commence erection piece be sawn prepared there will be machine ladder other appliance ten champion on side will fight a knight will have hundred apprentice a men at arm court party will have equal number of young esquire a winner of today tourney will have choice of defence attack must advise to take defence since be easier requires le knowledge of war many of other party have accompanied father master in field have seen real siege carried out can show plan of castle walter said if be not contrary to rule in order may think over plan of fighting tomorrow here be marshal said see that wall be foot long be foot in height with tower at end one over gateway in centre six foot high there be drawbridge defended by outwork of palisade six foot high moat will be dry one seeing that have mean of filling with water will be supposed to be full must be crossed on plank bridge two small tower on wheel will be provided may be run up to edge of moat will be a high a top of tower surely can not make before morning walter said will do so marshal replied castle have be put together in king courtyard piece be numbered two hundred carpenter will labour night at besides party of labourer for digging of moat will be rare show will delight citizen lady of court for thing have never before be attempted king grudge not expense will cost seeing that spectacle of kind do much to arouse warlike spirit of people here be list of various implement will be provided only be understood that mangonel arblasts will not be provided with missile seeing that many must assuredly be killed by will be employed however to show nature of work party of men at arm will be told off to serve crossbow arrow will be used weapon will be blunted will see that there be ladder plank for making bridge long hook for hauling men down from wall beam for battering down gate ax for cutting down palisade other weapon ten who will serve under a knight have already be nominated city will furnish with full armour for others apprentice of ward will choose sufficient representative to make up hundred who will fight a men at arm will wear steel cap breastpieces with leather jerkin vizor to protect face for even blunted arrow wooden quarrel might well kill if struck true on leaving marshal walter joined giles fletcher geoffrey ward who warmly congratulated upon success informed of spectacle king have prepared for amusement of citizen on morrow in faith geoffrey said idea be good one promise rare sport will be rough may expect many broken limb for be joke to be thrown down with ladder from wall even twelve foot high there will be depth of moat besides will only be two foot walter said for so be marked on plan do mean to take walter attack defence methinks king have erred somewhat in making force equal for assuredly besieger must outnumber besieged by fully three to one to give fair chance of success will take assault walter answered there be more to be done way than in defence when get home geoffrey will look at plan see what may be best manner of assault upon examining plan that evening found that wall be continued at angle at end for distance of twenty foot back so a to give postern gate behind of corner tower through sortie might be made geoffrey walter talked matter over together contrived plan of operation for following day will have one great advantage geoffrey said apprentice be accustomed to use of bow while young noble will know little of weapon therefore shooting will be far straighter truer even blunt headed arrow drawn from shoulder will hit so smart blow on wall will have difficulty in withstanding after talk be ended walter again crossed london bridge made way to ludgate where found late antagonist whose head have be plastered up be little worse for conflict there be ill will between hope walter said holding out hand none in world young smith said frankly be good tempered looking young giant with closely cropped hair light blue eye pleasant somewhat heavy face faith what blow be that gave why one must think that muscle be made of steel thought must hit good downright blow seeing have be hammering at anvil for last seven year strike a must must not beat down guard while mine went down a if have be feather before yours knew directly that have struck first blow felt how firm be defence that be up with knowing that in point of skill have chance whatever with be glad to see that bear malice ralph walter said hope that will be great friend henceforth be if will take a such seeing that be just out of apprenticeship while be not yet half through mine have come to talk to about tomorrow have heard that there be to be mimic siege have heard about ralph said city be talking of nothing else news be published at end of sport will be rare fun surely will be pretty rough fun walter replied must not be much surprised if life be lost be always so in tournament if knight noble be ready to be killed apprentice need not fear to hazard life now a to tomorrow a winner today be to be leader of party a second will of course be captain under now want to explain to exactly what propose to do to arrange with a to share in business young smith listened attentively to walter explanation when have done exclaimed admiringly why walter seem to be made for general how did come to lad must never have thought of such scheme talked over with master walter said idea be a much a mine wonder if will do be sure to do smith said enthusiastically castle be a good a taken next day london poured out to scene of sport greatest admiration wonder be expressed at castle have risen a if by magic in night be built at one end of list have be purposely placed in hollow so that great number of people besides in pavilion must obtain view from surrounding slope castle be substantially built of heavy timber painted gray looked at little distance a if constructed of stone flag floated from central tower building looked so formidable that general opinion be freely expressed that task of assailant whoever might be for at present be unknown be quite impossible at ten o'clock king court arrived after have taken place two band headed by leader advanced from lower end of list drew up in front of royal pavilion leader took place in front behind stood ten chosen follower of whom a well a chief be encased in full armour behind on one side be apprentice on other esquire attired a men at arm court party be led by clarence aylmer son of earl of pembroke companion be young men of noble family aspirant for order of knighthood be for most part somewhat older than apprentice a latter consisted chiefly of young men nearly out of term difference be not great walter armour be suit armourer have constructed year previously for young knight who have died before armour must be delivered walter have wondered more than once why geoffrey did not endeavour to sell elsewhere for although not so decorated inlaid a many of suit of milan armour be constructed of finest steel armourer have bestowed special care upon manufacture a young knight father have long be one of best customer early that morning geoffrey have brought to room have told to wear instead of lent by city fear will get injured walter have urged will not spare know geoffrey blow will be hard one more need for good armour walter city suit be made for show rather than use may be sure that young pembroke band will fight hardest rather than suffer defeat at hand of whom consider band of city varlet before issuing from tent where companion have put on mail walter carefully fastened in front of helmet tiny gold bracelet upon taking place before pavilion king ordered two leader to advance addressed multitude in following word brave leader people have contrived pastime today may show on mimic scale deed brave soldier be called upon to perform in france be more specially suited for combatant of today since one party have have small opportunity of acquiring skill on horseback moreover wish to teach lesson fighting on foot be a honourable a fighting on horseback for have now be proved sometimes to cost in scotland that footman can repulse even bravest chivalry today party will fight best remember even in heat of conflict matter must not be carried to extreme cut off from friend will be accounted prisoner a will who being overpowered throw down arm wounded on side will not be accounted a prisoner may retire with honour from field said looking at walter a conqueror of yesterday have choice of attack defence must advise to take latter seeing be easier to defend fortress than to assault many of opponent have already gained credit in real warfare while following be new to therefore in order to place defence on fair term with assault have ordered that side will be equal in number if liege will permit walter said bowing must fain take assault methinks that with following must do better thus than in defence king looked somewhat displeased a will said coldly fear will somewhat mar effect of spectacle seeing that will have chance against equal force more accustomed to war than party occupying so superior position however went on seeing that walter made sign of changing mind a have chosen so be now be for to choose lady who will be queen of tourney will deliver prize to victor look round there be many fair face be for to choose among smile passed between many of courtly dame lady at choice be to be made among by apprentice lad thought that must be sorely puzzled at duty walter however did not hesitate instant ran eye over crowd of lady in royal gallery soon saw object of search since have majesty permission said choose a queen of tournament mistress edith vernon there be movement of surprise general smile perhaps to who thought that have chance of being chosen selection be relief a none must be jealous of pretty child who at king order made way forward to front took seat in chair placed between king queen girl coloured brightly have heard so much of tourney joust that knew what be duty have be sitting far back on previous day apprentice when brought up before king be too far below for to see feature now recognized sir knight said in loud clear childish voice will both do duty today show yourselves worthy cavalier methinks that a queen of tourney must be neutral between a one of carry gage in helm good wish must need go with bright eye will be fixed on may well stir to deed of valour so saying resumed seat with pretty air of dignity why sweetheart king said how be that 'prentice lad know name how be that wear gage for know that young pembroke wear glove of earl of surrey daughter saved life sir mine mother child said told must be true knight gave bracelet see wear in helm recall somewhat of story king said will question lady vernon further anon see combatant be filing off to place with flag flying trumpet blowing young pembroke led force into castle of ten knight be followed by esquire bearing banner have ten men at arm under immediate order two of with twenty men remained in outwork beyond drawbridge rest took station on wall tower where platform have be erected running along three foot below battlement real men at arm with machine of war now advanced for time worked machine made pretence at casting great stone missile at wall assailant then moved forward unslinging bow opened heavy fire of arrow at defender who in turn replied with arrow cross bow 'prentices shoot well king said by lady must be hot work for defender be shaft pointed even a be knock must be child play for arrow although not pointed be tipped with iron without indeed straight shooting must be impossible return fire from wall be feeble king said laughing so far knight fair mistress have own way did not reckon sufficiently upon superiority of shooting of london lad indeed know not that ought not in fairness to order of defender off wall seeing that in warfare number must be rapidly thinned see assailant be moving up to two tower under shelter of fire of archer by time aylmer seeing that follower must make effectual reply to arrow fire have ordered save leader in full armour to lie down behind parapet assailant now gathered thickly round tower a if intended to attempt to cross by bridge must be let down from opening in tower level with top of wall while archer upon summit shot fast thick among defender who be gathering to oppose if young pembroke be king said will make strong sally now fall upon one other of party a spoke there be sudden movement on part of assailant who leaving foot of tower made rush at outwork in centre instant arrived fell to work with ax upon palisade many be struck down by blow dealt by defender others caught up ax in le than minute several of palisade be cut down assailant poured in defender fought gallantly be overpowered by number be struck down others taken prisoner by main force rest driven across drawbridge just a gate be opened pembroke at head of defender swarmed out to assistance there be desperate fight on bridge be well that armour be stout arm wielded weapon have not yet attained full strength several be knocked off bridge into moat be by rule obliged at once to retire take further part in contest walter ralph smith fought in front of men hard a pembroke follower struggled must not drive back foot court party be galled by heavy fire of arrow kept up by apprentice along side of moat finding effort to regain earth work useless pembroke withdrew force into castle in spite of effort of besieger managed to close gate in face assailant however succeeded in severing chain of drawbridge before must be raised from tower above defender now hurled over great stone have be specially placed there for purpose of destroying drawbridge must earthwork be carried board be soon splintered drawbridge be pronounced by earl of talbot who be acting a judge to be destroyed excitement of spectator be worked up to great pitch while conflict be going on citizen cheered lustily at success of apprentice be gallantly done king said to queen philippa leader of assailant be lad of rare mettle not captain of army not sir walter manny must have done more cleverly see by placing force at end of wall drew garrison thither to withstand assault from thus by sudden movement be able to carry outwork before must recover from surprise come down to aid be curious to know what will do next what thinkst thou edward asked son who be standing by side will win day young prince said in faith although others be comrade must be glad to see will make gallant knight sir one of day remember be engaged to follow banner so must not steal from see liege be taking plank ladder to outwork be doing wrongly then king said for even must bridge moat where drawbridge be can not scale wall there since tower defends ladder be long enough to reach lower wall leader have changed mind be taking plank along edge of moat towards tower on left will aid assault by bridge by passage of moat there seemed indeed that be plan while of assailant kept up arrow fire on wall others mounted tower while party prepared to throw bridge of plank across moat bridge from tower be now lowered shout of triumph rose from defender when be seen that by mistake of carpenter be too short when lowered did not reach within six foot of wall better king said while prince gave angry exclamation accident of kind will happen give opportunity to leader to show resource doubtless will carry plank up to tower so connect bridge wall indeed be what assailant tried to do while party threw plank across moat rushing over placed ladder against wall strove to climb strove in vain however ladder be thrown down a fast a be placed while defender thickly clustered on wall drove back who tried to cross from tower see leader of assailant prince said have white plume may have be shorn off king said look young pembroke be making sortie from sortie gate behind tower defender now poured out running down to edge of moat fell upon stormers however received with great steadiness while continued attack rest turned upon garrison headed by ralph smith drove gradually back fight well steadily king said one must have thought that have reckoned on sortie so steadily did receive a only portion of garrison have issued out be unable to resist long pressure of apprentice who drove back step by step to sally port pressing hard endeavoured to force way in at heel chapter vii young esquire while attention of whole of spectator combatant be fixed upon struggle at right hand angle of castle party of twenty 'prentices suddenly leapt to foot from among broken palisade of outwork lying prone there have escaped attention of spectator a well a of defender reason why assailant carried plank ladder to spot be now apparent only portion have be taken on to assault of right hand tower who now rose to foot lifted with plank ladder at rapid pace ran towards left angle of castle reached point before attention of few defender who remained on wall there be attracted to so absorbed be in struggle at other angle moment that saw new assailant raised shout of alarm din of combat shout of leader men be so loud that cry be unheard two three then hurried away at full speed to give alarm while others strove to repel assault effort be in vain plank be flung across moat ladder placed in position led by walter assailant sprang up gained footing on wall before alarm be fairly given thundering cheer from spectator greeted success of assailant springing along wall drove before few who strove to oppose gained central tower walter springing up to top pulled down banner of defender placed that of city in place at moment defender awakened too late to ruse have be played upon came swarming back along wall strove to regain central tower in confusion assault by flying tower of assailant be neglected at point also gained footing on wall young noble of court furious at being outwitted fought desperately to regain lost laurel king rose from seat held up hand trumpeter standing below sounded arrest of arm be echoed by two others who accompanied earl talbot who have taken place on horseback close to wall at sound sword dropt din abruptly ceased combatant stood glaring at other blood too heated to relinquish fray readily already much damage have be done in spite of armour mail many serious wound have be inflicted of combatant have already be carried senseless from field of assailant have be much shaken by being thrown backward from ladder into moat one two be hurt to death a few tourney took place without loss of several life be considered small amount of damage for so stoutly fought melee knowledge that many be wounded perhaps dying in way damped enthusiasm of spectator who cheered lustily for minute at triumph city have obtained in gallery occupied by lady noble of court there be comparative silence brave deed be appreciated in day although lady must far rather have seen victory incline other way yet waved handkerchief clapped hand in token of admiration at success of assault at commencement appeared well nigh hopeless lord talbot rode up to front of royal pavilion be about to stop fight sire when gave signal blood be up many must have be killed have combat continued castle be fairly won central tower be taken flag pulled down footing have be gained at point of wall assailant have forced way through sally port further resistance be therefore hopeless castle must be adjudged a fairly honourably captured renewed shout greeted judge decision king now ordered rival host to be mustered before a before battle when be done earl talbot conducted walter up broad step in front of king pavilion geoffrey ward who have after fastening on walter armour in tent before sport began taken place among guard at foot of royal pavilion stept forward removed walter helmet at foot of step young sir king said have borne right gallantly today have shown that posse quality make great captain do noble wrong when say that not one of must have better planned led assault than have done be not right sir looked round murmur of assent rose from knight noble king continued thought vain presumptuous in undertaking assault of fort held by equal number many of whom be well accustomed to war while lad who followed be untrained in strife have proved that confidence in yourself be not misplaced earl of talbot have adjudged victor none can doubt what end of strife must have be take chain from king who be glad to see that citizen of london be able to hold own even against of court than whom may say braver exist in europe kneel now to queen of tourney who will bestow upon chaplet have so worthily earned walter bent knee before edith vernon rose to foot with air of pretty dignity placed chaplet of laurel leaf wrought in gold clasped with

killed in trouble at commencement of majesty reign wife dame alice brought child to giles fletcher whose wife have be nurse dying left in care giles wife if called for can vouch for truth of can give proof of birth walter listened with astonishment to geoffrey speech thrill of pleasure rushed through vein a learned that be of gentle blood might hope to aspire to place among knight of king edward court understood now pain geoffrey have bestowed in seeing that be perfected in warlike exercise why giles have encouraged rather than repressed love for martial exercise determination to abandon craft become man at arm when reached man estate ah be so king exclaimed remember sir roland somers also that be slain by sir hugh spencer who a heard on many hand acted rather on private quarrel than a alleged in interest there be many who avowed that charge brought against sir roland be unfounded however matter must be inquired into high justiciar will see master giles wife hear evidence examine

bad walter sir john powis said men approach with air of resolution show that be bent upon success outnumber by twelve to one be likely enough that citizen may rise attack in rear have be ordered to bring stone for machine to wall one have laid hand to work must do duty a brave men lad doubt if yonder be not last sun will see furious a french be at recent success here may be sure that little

house sir john powis band be soon broken scattered leader slain by heavy stone from housetop walter fought way blindly forward towards castle although well knew that refuge must be found there ralph smith kept close beside levelling many of assailant with tremendous blow of huge mace somehow walter hardly knew how made way through assailant dashed in at castle gate crowd of assailant be close upon heel walter glanced round dashing across courtyard ran through passage into inner yard in a knew be well bucket hung at windlass catch hold ralph exclaimed there be just chance may a well be drowned a killed grasped rope jumped off bucket began to descend with frightful velocity faster faster went yet seemed long time before plunged into water be nigh hundred foot below surface fortunately rope be considerably longer than be necessary sank many foot into water still retaining hold then clinging to rope hauled to surface can not hold on here five minute ralph exclaimed armour be dragging down will soon get rid of walter said there go helmet now will hold on with one hand help to unbuckle breast back piece do same for with great effort managed to rid of armour then held on with ease to rope hauled bucket to surface tied knot in slack of rope so that bucket hung four foot below level of water putting foot in be able to stand with head above surface without difficulty be nice fix ralph exclaimed think must have be just a well to have be killed at once be sure to find here if will die of cold before tomorrow morning think will find walter said cheerfully when have searched castle thoroughly may occur to of that have jumped down well will be particular business of anyone to look for will be too anxious to get at wine butt to trouble head about matter besides must be heavy job to wind up bucket be not likely there will be such urgent need of water that anyone will undertake task be better off if ralph remarked for must die here if be not hauled out suppose intend to try climb rope might do twenty foot so on pinch must no more get up to top there than must fly must think over walter rejoined where there be will there be way know will take by turn to watch little patch of light overhead if see anyone looking down must leave bucket swim to side without making least noise may give few turn of windlass to see if anyone have hold of rope below be sure make slightest splashing noise for sound must be heard above to certainty ten minute later saw two head appear above instantly withdrew foot from bucket made stroke to side be four foot distant being careful a did that motion be imparted to rope then though be too dark to see anything heard bucket lifted from water minute later fell back again with splash then be quiet be safe now can take place in bucket be satisfied that if did jump down here be drowned now must think about climbing up aye will require good deal of thinking ralph grumbled for time there be silence then walter said first thing to do be to cut off slack of rope there be twelve foot of then will unwind strand of there be five six large strand a far a can feel will cut up into length of about couple of foot ought to be able to tie to rope in such way a not to slip down with weight if tie four foot apart can go up step by step see much difficulty about ralph said much more cheerfully must think that must manage that at once set to work rope be cut up unravelled strand cut into piece about two foot long then set to work trying to discover way of fastening by must not slip down rope made many fruitless attempt time that strand be fastened with loop large enough for to pas leg through slid down rope when weight be applied to at last succeeded in finding out knot must hold be done by tying knot close to one end of piece of strand then sufficient be left to form loop remainder be wound round rope in such way that weight only served to tighten hold will begin at once ralph said when success be achieved have better wait until vibration of rope when weight once get on might be noticed by anyone crossing courtyard do think have sufficient bit of rope ralph asked just enough think walter replied there be six strand have made six piece so have thirty six know well be about hundred foot deep for other day heard of soldier who be drawing water grumbling over labour required so if put three foot apart will take thirty three of will leave three over have better place little over yard so a to make sure in short time fading brightness of circle of light far overhead told that twilight have commenced shortly afterwards attached first strand to rope three foot above water now walter said will go first at rate for time must put one leg through loop sit a be while fasten one above a will want hand for work will find good deal easier to stand with foot in loop if get tired will fasten loop by side of on be resting so can come up pas there be hurry ought not to take up above hour will not do for to get to top until place becomes little quiet tonight be sure to be drinking feasting over victory until late now set to work step by step mounted rope found work le arduous than have expected rope be dry strand held tightly to two three time changed place resting in turn from work in le than two hour from time made first loop walter head shoulder appeared above level of courtyard must hear sound of shouting singing within castle knew that great feast be going on descending step two held parley with ralph think perhaps will be better to sally out at once everyone be intent on own pleasure will have difficulty in slipping out of castle unnoticed will be feasting riot in town so long a brush against one so that may feel wet garment be little likely to be noticed besides gate of town will stand open late for people from village round will have come in to join in revel be ready to try master walter ralph replied for ache from head to foot with holding on to rope sooner better

dipped in took long draught of wine then turning off from principal street made way by quiet lane down to one of gate to dismay found that be closed french commander knew that sir walter manny salisbury might ere be pressing forward to relieve town that finding that have fallen might attempt to recapture by sudden attack while permitting therefore usual licence after successful assault to

ralph walter said let make way thither at once everyone be so excited in city a yet there will be few guard upon wall sooner therefore attempt to make escape better chapter xiii white ford made way without interruption to wall found a expected entirely deserted although doubt guard have be posted at gate fleming however must have felt fear of attack by so small force a five hundred english whom knew to be in neighbourhood walter companion soon knotted rope together lowered into moat few stroke took to other side scrambling out made way across country to spot where english have be posted found earl of salisbury who commanded in great state of uneasiness message have reached during day have heard alarm bell of city ring scout who have gone forward returned with news that gate be closed drawbridge raised that strong body of men manned wall news be indeed bad said when walter related to event have taken place in town will altogether derange king plan now that ally be killed fear that hope of acquiring flanders for england will fall to ground be thousand pity that listened to van artevelde allowed to enter ghent alone have majesty landed a wished made progress through country prince receiving homage of large town must then very well have summoned ghent a standing alone against flanders citizen then must no doubt have gladly opened gate received prince if have refused must have made short work of however a have turned out be a well that did not enter town with fleming for against so large turbulent population must have have little chance now master somers will march at once for sluys bear news to king will tell a ride thither how man at arm managed to escape with whole skin from such tumult king be much grieved when heard of death of artevelde held council with chief leader at first in indignation grief be disposed to march upon ghent to take vengeance for murder of ally after time calmer counsel prevailed fleming be still in rebellion against count who be friend of france be english to attack ghent must lose general goodwill of fleming must drive into arm of france while if matter be left alone effect of popular outburst have caused death of artevelde must die away motif of interest fear of france must again drive into arm of england expedition therefore returned to england there king in proclamation to people avoided allusion to death of ally simply stated that have be waited upon by council of flemish town faithful obedience to a legitimate king of france be established upon firmer basis than ever course have effect have anticipated from people of flanders perceived danger disadvantage must accrue to trade from permanent disagreement with england be convinced by event soon afterwards happened in france that king of england have more power than phillip of valois must if chose punish severely breach of faith towards therefore sent over commissioner to express grief submission death of artevelde be represented a act of frantic mob severe fine be imposed upon leader of party who slew although principal town expressed desire still to remain under rule of count of flanders suggested that tie bound to england must be strengthened by marriage of louis eldest son of count to one of edward daughter more than offered to create diversion for english force acting in guienne gascony by raising strong force expelling french garrison

other town character of jacob van artevelde have have scant justice done to by most of historian of time living in age of chivalry when noble blood lofty deed be held in extraordinary respect have little sympathy with brewer of ghent deemed contrary to fitness of thing that chivalry of france must have be defied worsted by mere mechanic artisan there can be doubt that artevelde be very great

country dispersing slaughtering band of french who still remained together towards night earl of northampton returned to camp with news that enemy remained in vicinity must offer show of resistance to english force be said that far greater number of french be killed upon second day than upon first can be accounted for by fact that on first day small portion of english army be engaged that upon second english be fresh vigorous enemy exhausted dispirited greater number of french noble knight who fell died in attempt to break through black prince array besides king of bohemia nine sovereign

garrison refused to comply with demand fortification of town be extremely strong garrison numerous edward perceived that assault must be very unlikely to succeed must entail great loss while repulse must have dimmed lustre of success have gained therefore determined to reduce by famine troop be set to work to build hut so permanently strongly be constructed that seemed to enemy that king edward be determined to remain before calais even must have to stay there for ten year proclamation be issued in england flanders inviting trader to establish store to bring article of trade of kind in short time complete town sprang up be named by edward new town bold english fleet held complete possession of sea cutting off besieged from succour by ship enabling abundant supply for army to be brought

however managed to escape from vigilance of guard when out hawking fled to court of france in scotland phillip be more successful david bruce instead of employing time given by absence of edward with army in driving out english garrison from strong place still held in scotland raised army of men marched across border into england plundering ravaging queen philippa however raising army marched against scotch be completely defeated at neville cross being killed king taken prisoner walter conduct at battle of cressy gained still further favour of black prince valour with have fought be conspicuous even on field where fought gallantly prince felt that more than once must have be smitten down have not walter sword interposed ralph too have fought with reckless bravery many french knight gentleman have gone down before tremendous blow of heavy mace against stoutest armour availed nothing after battle prince offered to make esquire in spite of absence of gentle blood in vein ralph declined honour please sir prince said must feel more comfortable among men at arm fellow in day of battle trust must do discredit to squirehood at other time must feel woefully out of element must find nought for hand to do therefore if so plea royal highness must far rather remain simple man at arm ralph did not however refuse heavy purse prince gave although indeed a well a soldier be well supplied with money so great be spoil army have gathered in march before cressy now swept off in raid among northern province of france one evening walter be returning from banquet at pavilion of prince of wale with ralph a usual following at little distance when from corner of street man darted suddenly out struck dagger with force between shoulder well be for walter that have taken geoffrey advice have never laid aside shirt of mail night day fine a be temper two three link of outer fold be broken point did not penetrate second fold dagger snapped in hand of striker force of sudden blow however hurled walter to ground with loud cry ralph rushed forward man instantly fled ralph pursued short distance then hastened back to walter be hurt sir walter exclaimed in way ralph thanks to shirt of mail well indeed be for be wearing must assuredly have be dead man have almost begun to forget be threatened man will be on guard for future wish have followed fellow ralph said must not have slain must have helped must have left for hangman to extort from name of employer in truth struck so hard fell so straight before blow feared mail have given way that be sorely wounded if not killed have oft told that be over careful of see be not careful enough however may be assured that if attempt be made who attempt will not get off scot free do think of laying complaint before provost against suspect must be useless ralph may have suspicion of man from whom blow came have manner of proof might have be done by ruffian camp follower who struck blow only with hope of carrying off chain purse camp swarm with such fellow have clue must lead to detection unless added stooping picking piece of steel lay at foot broken dagger may day furnish with one will say nought about sir james carnegie be not now in camp having left week since on business in england exchange word when meet heard that have be called away fortunately young prince like not therefore have seldom occasion to meet have doubt that credit with disfavour in be held by prince have never even mentioned name before prince misliking be feeling noble generous heart have a though by instinct against one who be false treacherous at same time must grant that traitor knight be bold fearless man at arm fought well at la blanche tache cressy be much liked trusted by lord of northampton in whose following mostly ride 't be pity one so brave must have so foul treacherous heart here be at hut can sleep soundly tonight ralph for there be little fear that fellow who have failed tonight will repeat attempt for time think doubt that have killed for with blow so strongly struck must scarcely have felt snapping of weapon be likely enough already on board one of ship ply to fro from england on way to acquaint employer that be removed from path next morning walter mentioned to black prince venture have befallen narrow escape have have of life prince be extremely exasperated gave order that inquisition must be made through camp that men found there not being able to give good account of a having reasonable lawful calling there must be forthwith put on board ship sent to england questioned walter closely whether deemed that attack be for purpose of plunder only whether have reason to believe that have private enemy there be knight who be evilly disposed toward highness walter said seeing have proof that have hand in affair however strongly may suspect must fain with leave avoid mentioning name think that there be knight in camp capable of so foul action have have proof highness that be capable of such act in matter tongue be tied a wrong attempted be not against against others who have so far forgiven that must fain matter must drop owes ill will seeing that be aware of conduct that be intervention caused scheme to fail must attempt against be repeated can scarce be effect of chance must show premeditated design must then both in defence of own life because think that such deed must not go unpunished not hesitate to name to if proof be wanting to defy to open combat regret sir walter that scruple must hinder from at once denouncing seeing how grave matter be to charge knight with so foul crime will not lay stress upon be assured must repetition of attempt be made will take matter in hand will see that caitiff knight receives dessert short time afterwards accompanied prince in excursion made with portion of army sweeping french province a far a river somme upon way back passed through village of pres hard by stood small castle be situated forty mile from calais standing upon rising ground commanded very extensive view over country what say sir walter prince said to young knight who be riding near castle must make good advanced post messenger riding in must bring news of large movement of enemy walter assented then sir walter name chatelain will be sorry to lose good company post be one of peril know that be ever longing to distinguish take forty men at arm sixty archer with force may make shift to resist attack until help reach from camp may be sure that will not be slack in spurring to rescue must be assailed walter received proposal with delight be weary of monotony of life in new town post in vigilance activity must be required be just to taste so taking force named by prince with store of provision drew off from column entered castle chapter xv siege of fortalice walter first step on assuming command be to examine thoroughly into capability of defence of place to see that well be in good order supply of water ample to send out foraging party driving in number of beast cart load of forage must supply garrison for time castle found be le strong than looked wall be lightly built be incapable of withstanding heavy battering moat be dry flanking tower badly placed affording little protection to face of wall however extent of defence be small walter felt confident that with force at command must resist sudden attack unless made in overwhelming force so that face of wall must be assaulted at same time have large number of great stone brought in to pile against gate while others be brought into central keep similarly to defend door must outer wall be carried appointed ralph a lieutenant day leaving in charge of castle rode through country for many mile round with twenty men at arm to convince that considerable force of enemy be approaching reconnaissance be not without danger excitement for several time body of country people armed with scythe ax stave tried to intercept on return to castle once twice walter men have to fight way through opponent contrary to custom of time walter gave order to men not to slay when resistance have ceased be doing what must do did french garrison hold castle at home deem in way to be blamed for effort make to slay in self defence of course must do best must kill in order that may not ourselves be slain when be once routed let go to home poor people misery war have brought upon be great there be wonder that hate leniency on walter part be not without good effect when country people found that garrison of castle of pres did not carry fire sword through village around that took only sufficient for need behaved with courtesy to animosity to great extent subsided no longer did woman child of little village fly to wood when saw gleam of walter approaching spear remained at avocation answered willingly enough question asked a to whether have heard aught of movement of french troop so far a possible walter refrained from seizing cattle store of grain of poorer class taking such a needed from land of wealthy proprietor of whom have left country be either with french army sheltering in paris five of best mounted men walter chose a messenger one rode day to new town with news have be gathered returning on following day then resting horse for three day before again setting out night day sentry be placed on wall for although walter heard nothing of body gathering in immediate vicinity force might at moment issue from amiens appear suddenly before place such be indeed what really took place at daybreak one morning walter be aroused by news that sentinel saw large body of men rapidly approaching horse of messenger next on duty stood a usual saddled bridled in readiness without moment delay walter ordered man to mount ride to prince to give news that castle be assailed by how large force must not a yet say instant messenger have started through gate walter ascended to wall saw at once that party be strong one for although still at distance dimly seen in gray morning light judged that must contain at least thousand men at arm at moment call from sentry on other side of castle be heard hastening thither walter saw that body nearly a numerous a first be approaching from side of calais having made detour so a to place between castle army to news must naturally be sent of coming walter watched messenger who have now ridden half mile towards approaching body suddenly saw turn horse ride off at right angle to road see said be going to try to ride round fear that there be little hope of escaping seeing that be between calais assuredly among must be a well better mounted than a spoke party of horseman be seen to detach from flank of french column to gallop off at full speed to intercept messenger latter diverged more more from course be constantly headed off by pursuer at last seeing impossibility of getting through again turned horse head galloped off towards castle reached few hundred yard only in advance of foe must not help sir walter said a galloped in at gate found that although robin be fast of horseman have turn of speed of that be impossible must get through so deeming must do more service by coming to strike blow here than by having throat cut out in field made best of way back quite right martin walter said must have be grieved have thrown life away needlessly saw from first that escape be cut off now men to place first pile up stone against gate then let man take good meal for be like enough to be long before get chance of doing so again again ascending to wall walter saw that first body of men at arm have perceived be followed at distance by strong force of footman having with large wagon fear said to ralph that have brought machine with from amiens in case will not be long in effecting breach for doubtless know that wall be weak will have to fight stoutly for may be day before news of leaguer reach camp however trust that prince will by tomorrow night when find that two day have elapsed without coming of usual messenger suspect that be besieged will sally forth to assistance now let to breakfast for will need strength today may be sure that french will lose time in attacking seeing that assistance may shortly arrive from calais there be few preparation to be made man have have post assigned to on wall in case of attack pile of stone have be collected in readiness to cast down upon head of attempting assault cauldron be carried up to wall filled with water great fire be lighted under in hour french infantry have reached spot two hour elapsed before hostile movement be made leader of assailant giving men that time to rest after long march then stir be visible among be seen to form in four column about thousand strong advanced simultaneously against opposite side of castle a soon a intention be manifest walter divided little force gathering in four group upon wall prepared to resist assault to four of most trusty men at arm assigned command of party ralph being thus left free to give aid where be most needed assailant be well provided with scaling ladder advanced with number of crossbow men in front who speedily opened hot fire on wall walter ordered archer to bide time not to fire shot till certain that shaft must tell accordingly waited until french arrived within fifty yard of wall when arrow began to rain among with deadly effect scarce one struck mark face of enemy even closed vizor of knight chief men at arm did not avail to protect wearer shaft pierced between bar penetrated slit left open for sight many fell slain by first volley number be far too great to allow column being checked by fire of so small number of archer front rank indeed pressed forward more eagerly than before being anxious to reach foot of wall where must be in comparative shelter from arrow archer disturbed in way at reaching of wall by head of column continued to shoot fast true into mass behind a be for most part le completely armed than leader number fell under fire of sixty english bowman be turn of men at arm now immediately assailant poured into dry moat sought to raise ladder men at arm hurled down mass of stone piled in readiness while poured bucket of boiling water over in spite of loss be suffering french raised ladder covering head with shield leader strove to gain wall a did so of archer took post in flanking tower a with uplifted arm assailant climbed ladder archer smote above joint of armour beneath arm pit while men at arm with pike battle axe hewed down who reached top of ladder walter ralph hastened from point to point encouraging men joining in defence where pressure be hottest at last after two hour of vain effort suffering great loss assailant drew off garrison have breathing time well done men walter said cheeringly have have lesson will remember if so be that have brought with machine may hold out against for time be soon manifest however that along with scaling ladder enemy have brought one of war machine men be seen dragging massive beam of timber towards wall one of wagon be drawn forward upset on side at distance of sixty yard from wall not however without who drew suffering much from arrow of bowman behind shelter thus formed french began to put together machine whose beam soon raised high above wagon in meantime group of men dragged great stone laid upon sort of hand sledge to machine late in afternoon began to cast missile against wall against walter must do little have sack filled with earth might have lowered to cover part of wall assailed beyond annoying working machine by flight of arrow shot high in air so a to descend point downwards among must hing wall crumbled rapidly beneath blow of great stone walter saw that by following morning breach must be effected when night fell called men together asked if must volunteer to carry news through enemy to prince enterprise seemed well nigh hopeless for french a if foreseeing that attempt might be made have encamped in complete circle round castle a be manifest by position of fire several men stepped forward walter chose three light active men archer to attempt enterprise stripped off steel cap breastpieces so that might move more quickly when french fire burned low be quiet save creak of machine dull heavy blow of stone against wall three men be lowered by rope at different point started on enterprise quarter of hour later garrison heard shout cry knew that vigilant watch have be set by french that one if not of friend have fallen into hand night long machine continued to play hour before daylight when deemed that enemy vigilance must be relaxed walter caused with ralph twelve of men at arm to be lowered by rope from wall rope have loop at bottom in one foot be placed knot be tied in order to give better grasp for hand be lowered at short distance from spot at machine be at work be armed with ax made way unperceived until within few yard of wagon then there be cry of alarm in moment rushed forward among enemy men working machine be instantly cut down walter party fell upon machine cutting rope smashing wheel pulley hewing away at timber in minute two however be attacked by enemy officer in command having bade hundred men lie down to sleep close behind machine in case garrison must attempt sortie walter called upon ralph four of men at arm to stand beside while others continued work of destruction french came up in tumultuous body standing so far apart that must wield ax english dealt such destruction among first assailant that for time recoiled a fresh number came up encouraged by leader renewed attack in spite of most tremendous effort walter party be driven back by time however so much damage have be done to machine that must be hour before must be repaired even if spare rope other appliance have be brought with from amiens so that reinforced by working party walter be again able to hold ground after repulsing fresh onslaught of enemy gave word for men to retire at full speed french be so surprised by sudden disappearance of foe that be moment two before started in pursuit walter men have gained thirty yard before pursuit really commenced night be dark one considerably increased advantage before reach foot of wall where rope be hanging have of found rope walter asked a soon a affirmative answer be given placed foot in loop shouted to men above to draw up before enraged enemy must reach spot whole party be already yard above head archer opened fire upon french doing in spite of darkness considerable execution for men have snatched up arm at sudden alarm have joined fray in such haste that many of have not have time to put on steel cap there be noise bustle in enemy camp for whole force be now under arm in anger at sudden blow have be struck body of men even moved forward towards wall a if intended to renew assault of previous day shower of arrow with be greeted cooled ardour presently retired out of reach of bowshot there be respite now for besieger no longer few minute did heavy stone strike wall morning light enabled defender of castle to see extent of damage battering machine have effected none too soon have put stop to work for have continued operation hour two must have effected breach already large portion of wall facing have fallen other portion be so seriously damaged that few more blow must have levelled at rate walter said to ralph have gained respite even now fear that if black prince come not until tomorrow will arrive too late french apparently a well aware a garrison of necessity for haste laboured at repair of machine body of men started to cut down tree to supply place of beam have be rendered useless scarcely have assault ceased when horseman be despatched in various direction to seek for fresh rope by dint of greatest exertion machine be placed in position to renew attack shortly after noon by two o'clock several large portion of damaged wall have fallen debris formed slope by assaulting column must rush to bridge a soon a be manifest french force formed for assault rushed forward in solid column walter have made best preparation possible for defence in courtyard behind breach men have since morning be driving circle of pile connected by plank fastened to be five foot high along top in face next to breach sharp pointed spike nail have be driven rendering difficult in extreme for anyone to climb over a column of assailant approached walter placed archer on wall on side of breach while with men at arm took station in gap faced coming host breach be ten yard wide be only for about width that mound of broken stone rendered possible for enemy to assault consequently there be space of fifteen foot in width to be defended regardless of flight of arrow french headed by knight squire advanced to assault clambering up rough stone attacked defender walter with ralph three of best men at arm stood in front line received first shock of assault roughness steepness of mound prevented french from attacking in regular order very eagerness of knight squire who came first in contact with enemy be hindrance to when column be seen gathering for assault walter have scattered several barrel full of oil tar found in cellar over mound in front of breach rendering greasy slippery causing assailant to slip stagger many to fall a pressed forward to assault before fight commenced have encouraged soldier by recalling to how mere handful of men have at cressy withstood for hour desperate effort of whole of french army to break through line be prepared to fight to death struggle be desperate one served by higher position by difficulty french encountered from slipperiness of ground own fierce ardour to attack walter little band for long time resisted effort with sword ralph with heavy mace did great execution be nobly seconded by men at arm a fast a one fell took place breach in front of be cumbered with dead red with blood still french poured upwards in wave sheer weight of number fatigue caused by tremendous exertion defender be making began to tell step by step english be driven back walter saw that defence must not much longer be continued bade one of men at arm at once order archer to cease firing leaving wall to take refuge in keep thence to open fire upon french a poured through breach when found that movement have be accomplished walter bade men at arm fall back gradually gap have be left in wooden fence sufficient for one at time to pas through men at arm retired one by one to keep until only walter five others be left with walter flung suddenly upon assailant forced few foot down slope then gave word sprang back leaping down from wall into courtyard ran through barrier walter ralph being last to pas a french with exulting shout leapt down from breach there be fierce fight at barrier walter left ralph to defend with few men at arm while saw that be in readiness for closing door rapidly in keep then ran back again be just in time ralph indeed must for long time have held narrow passage barrier be yielding french be pouring in through breach a behind must not see nature of obstacle arrested advance of companion continued to push forward by weight pressed in front against spike in barrier many perished miserably on others whose armour protected from fate be crushed to death by pressure be now so great that timber be yielding walter seeing that in moment must be levelled gave word sprang back with ralph party entered keep just a with crash barrier fell french poured in crowd into courtyard bolting door defender of keep piled against stone have be laid in readiness door be on first floor be approached by narrow flight of stone step up two abreast must advance in first fury french poured up step from loophole commanded english bowman shot so hard that arrow pierced strongest armour smitten through vizor armour number of bravest of assailant fell dead who gained top of step be assailed by shower of boiling oil from upper chamber projected over door whose floor be pierced for purpose while from top of keep shower of stone be poured down after losing great number in desperate effort at french drew off for while while leader held council a to best measure to be taken for capture of keep after time walter from summit saw several body of men detach from crowd still without castle proceed into country two hour later be seen returning laden with trunk of tree be dragged through breach be in spite of effort of archer of men at arm with stone placed so a to form sort of penthouse against one side of keep number of soldier now poured up with sack kind of vessel have gathered from surrounding village filled with earth be thrown over beam until filled crevice between formed covering foot thick so that boiling oil water poured from above must penetrate to injure working beneath shelter when be ready strong body armed with pick crowbar entered penthouse began to labour to cut away wall of keep commander know business walter said device be excellent one can hing only depends upon strength of wall how long can hold out masonry be by mean good before nightfall unless aid come there will be nought for death surrender chapter xvi prisoner a long a be light anxious look out be kept from top of keep towards calais there be nothing to be done besieger who have entered wall be ensconced in various building in courtyard placed behind wall so a to be out of arrow shot from above be in readiness to repel sortie might be made to interfere with work going on under penthouse sortie be possible for to effect must be necessary to remove stone from door before must be accomplished besieger must have rallied in overwhelming force must sortie have effected anything beyond slaying of men actually engaged in work beam of penthouse be too strong too heavily weighted with earth to be removed attempt must only have entailed useless slaughter penthouse be about forty foot in length assailant be piercing three opening of six foot in width leaving two strong supporting pillar between anxiously garrison within listened to sound of work became louder louder a wall crumbled before stroke of pickaxe crowbar will hold out until last moment walter said to ralph in hope of relief before burst in will sound parley to resist further must be vain sacrifice of life presently movement must be seen among stone then almost simultaneously two aperture appeared chamber into opening be made be large one being used a common room of garrison here twenty archer remaining men at arm of whom nearly one half have fallen in defence of breach be gathered instant orifice appeared archer began to send arrow through then walter ascended to chamber ordered trumpeter to sound parley sound be repeated by assailant trumpeter who command force walter asked guy count of evreux be sir walter somers young knight continued wish to ask term for garrison must surrender unconditionally count replied from courtyard in ten minute will have completely pierced wall will be at mercy may pierce wall walter replied will cost many life before force way in will defend hold from floor to floor know how desperate men can fight will cost score of life before win way to summit of keep if have knightly word that life of within wall will be spared then will open door lay down arm consultation took place between leader below there be truth in walter word very many life must be sacrificed before resistance of so gallant garrison must be overcome minute be of importance for be possible that at moment aid might arrive from calais that table must be turned upon besieger therefore after short parley among count replied have fought a gallant knight gentleman sir walter somers have wrought grievous harm upon leading must grieve that so brave knight must lose life in useless resistance therefore agree to term swear upon knightly honour that upon surrendering yourselves prisoner of war life of within wall will be spared walter at once gave order stone be removed door thrown open leading men walter descended step into courtyard be now illuminated with torch handed sword to count of evreux promised count tall knight standing by side said that if be taken alive commander of castle must be prisoner did so sir phillip holbeaut when proposed adventure to offered to place following at command agreed to request made mind said sternly knightly word have be given for safety see that receives fair gentle treatment at hand must not that aught must befall so brave knight seek harm knight said angrily know that be one of knight of black prince own suite that ransom will be freely paid a coffer be low from expense of war must fain replenish at expense of english prince said not that doubted sir phillip count said calmly a knight surrendered on word be needful must warn to treat a must do did remain in hand to give fair treatment until duly ransomed must be glad count walter said if will suffer to take with a companion in captivity man at arm be strongly attached to have gone through many peril together will lighten captivity to have by side surely will do so sir walter wish boon have be larger one rest will take back with to amiens there to hold until exchanged for of who at various time have fallen into king hand now to work men lose not moment in stripping castle of that choose to carry away then apply fire to storehouse granary hold must not that remained standing to serve a outpost for english horse be brought from stable walter ralph took horse by bridle followed sir phillip holbeaut through now open gate of castle to spot where horse of besieger be picketed knight own men at arm who have at beginning of day numbered hundred fifty who be now scarcely two third of strength at once mounted with prisoner rode off from castle few minute later glare of light burst out from behind count order have be obeyed fire have be applied to store of forage soon castle of pres be wrapped in flame like not captor manner ralph said to walter a rode along side by side agree with ralph believe that reason gave count for request be not true one though indeed can see other motive must have for seeking to gain possession of sir phillip although valiant knight bear indifferent reputation have heard that be cruel master to serf that when away fighting in germany behaved so cruelly to peasantry even german who be not nice in mode of warfare cried out against be evil fortune have thrown into hand still although grasping avaricious can hardly demand for simple knight inordinate ransom french must cry out did do so seeing that so large number of own knight be in hand that king have ample power of retaliation however need not look on dark side be not likely that captivity will be long one for prince who be soul of generosity will not haggle over term will pay ransom a soon a hears into whose hand have fallen while there be score of men at arm prisoner whom can exchange for doubtless sir phillip will send over a soon a arrives at castle with one of own follower to treat for ransom after riding for hour troop halted weary horse in wood lighting fire cooked food then lay down until morning sir phillip exchanged few word with captive a having removed helm sat by fire walter have opportunity of seeing countenance did not belie reputation face have heavy brutal expression be not decreased by fashion of hair be cut quite short stood up without parting over bullet shaped head have heavy bristling moustache be cut short in line with lip be well walter thought to that be ransom rather than life be dear to evil looking knight for assuredly be not one to hesitate did fortune throw foe into hand at daybreak march be resumed be continued until reached castle of sir phillip holbeaut stood on narrow tongue of land formed by sharp bend of somme on entering castle knight gave order to follower prisoner be at once led to narrow cell beneath one of tower walter looked round indignantly when arrived there be dungeon for felon exclaimed not apartment for knight who have be taken captive in fair fight tell master that be bound to award honourable treatment that unless remove instantly from dungeon to proper apartment treat with due respect courtesy will when regain liberty proclaim dishonoured knight men at arm made reply locking door behind left prisoner alone what can mean ralph walter exclaimed be in lowest dungeon below level of river see how damp be wall floor be thick with slimy mud river must run just below loophole in time of flood probably enters here phillip of holbeaut on dismounting ascended to upper chamber where man in dress of well to do citizen be sitting well sir phillip exclaimed rising to foot a other entered what news news be bad knight growled famous scheme of yours have cost fifty of best men must have have nothing to do with walter somers other exclaimed what of have not escaped surely force marched from amiens be large enough to have eaten garrison have not escaped knight replied then be killed other said eagerly be killed be at present prisoner in dungeon below together with stout knave whom begged might accompany until ransomed be well then other exclaimed never mind loss of men money have promised for business will hire two hundred such knave why didst not knock on head at once be not so easy to knock on head sir phillip growled cost five hundred men to capture outer wall to have fought way into keep held a be by men who must have contested foot of ground be not job for of have much stomach seeing what first assault have cost so count took to quarter rest carried with to amiens leader according to promise made handed over to a share of day booty giving charge that must receive good knightly treatment doubt will observe other said with ugly laugh be bad business knight exclaimed angrily be not for friendship in spain memory of sundry deed did together not without profit to purse must rather that be thrown over battlement into river than have taken step in business however none can say that phillip of holbeaut ever deserted friend who have proved true to not to mention that sum promised for aid in matter will at present time prove wondrously convenient yet foresee that will bring into trouble with count of evreux ere many day demand will come for fellow to be delivered on ransom what will say other asked will say what be truth knight replied though may add something be not wholly so will say that be drowned in somme will add that happened a be trying to make escape contrary to parole have given in truth will be drowned in dungeon in have placed have rid of many troublesome prisoner before now river be at ordinary time two foot below loophole when tide be swelled by rain often rise above sill then there be end of one within can doubt word there be not many who must care to do so openly none who must do so for sake of unknown english knight a for complaint on part of black prince king phillip have shown over over again how little complaint of edward move be almost better to knock on head at once other said thoughtfully fellow have a many life a cat if have a many a nine cat knight replied must not avail will have violence water will do work a well a poinard will not have said even among such ruffian a mine that slew captured knight other will pas a accident care not what men may think a long a can say nothing for surety count may storm a much a will may even lay complaint against before king in time like present even simple knight who can lead two hundred good fighting men into field be not to be despised king be likely to be easily satisfied with reply to question may be raised indeed must seem contrary to reason must slay captive against whom have cause of quarrel so forfeit ransom must get for suppose that messenger must come offering ransom before river happens to rise then will anticipate matter will say that what know will happen have already taken place be uneasy sir james have word in matter now have gone so far will carry through from moment when ordered into dungeon fate be sealed in truth when gave order did so to put end to indecision in mind have be all night once in there must not be allowed to come out alive for report of such treatment must do more harm among of own station in france than rumour touching end must do be uncommon affair for one to remove enemy from one path cruelty to knightly prisoner must be regarded with horror must like to have look at other hesitated replied against personally have great grudge have thwarted plan stand now grievously in way of making fresh one a did so from ill will towards a be by hazard have personal hatred towards though must fain remove from path besides tell fairly even in dungeon where have thrown will not feel that be safe until send word that be dead have twice already got out of scrape when other men must have be killed at vannes at ghent escaped in marvellous way few week since by accident of having coat of mail under doublet saved life from a fair blow a ever be struck therefore must not that knew aught of having hand in matter for if after having seen made escape must never show face in england again must advise to bid three four men always enter cell together for that man of arm who follows like shadow be capable of playing desperate trick to escape matter be easily enough managed sir phillip said grimly by one entering dungeon at river may be slow of rising though in sky look overcast now be already at usual winter level whether dy from lack of water from too abundant supply matter little to only a told will give order for to be killed dost remember that jew carried off from seville kept without water until agreed to pay ransom made rich for six month be rare haul must rich jew be plentiful in country yes be good time other said although own have not done badly since war began having taken count three knight prisoner put to ransom having reaped goodly share of plunder from french burgher else indeed must not have offered so round sum to settle little matter for there be not many french knight who have earned count ransom in present war now will take horse here be one half of sum promised in gold noble will send remainder on day when get news from that matter be finished have money ready in week time knight replied taking bag of gold other placed on table for by time will hear from hope will not be last business may do together there ought to be plenty of good chance in war like time that can send word of intended foray by small party under commander whose ransom must be high one will share what get with similarly will let know of rich prize who may be pounced upon on same term agreed other said may do good business together in way lie too far away if move up a near a can to calais let know whereabouts so must send ride to in few hour might work together with small profit will take field a soon a affair of yours be settled knight replied messenger who brings news will tell where may be found now while horse be being got ready let drink stoup of wine together in memory of old time though for wine of ours be poor insipid beside fiery juice of spain while conversation upon fate so much depended have be going on walter ralph have be discussing situation have arrived at tolerably correct conclusion conduct on part of brutal french knight ralph be so strange that methinks can not be mere outcome of passion of hate against a englishman of deeper motive be right in thinking that in bargaining for person with count of evreux be more than ransom sought have that be only object must never have thrown into noisome dungeon for report of such treatment must bring dishonour upon in eye of knight noble in france a well a in england must be life aim at although what grudge can have against pass to imagine may be at cressy elsewhere dear relative of may have fallen by sword yet be so men nourish grudge for death of killed in fair fight boot not at present be enough for that be life aim at fear ralph yours must be included with mine since must never let witness escape to carry foul tale against being so agreement on surrendered be broken be free to make escape if can methinks sooner that be attempted better so let work to plan how may best get out of place after escape from well at vannes need not despair about breaking out from dungeon of holbeaut might overpower guard who brings food ralph said there be that chance walter rejoined think be poor one may be sure that dishonourable treatment will have rendered desperate will take precaution come well armed may be too that will not come at that intend to die of starvation perchance to be drowned by flood be easy to see often make way in here escape if escape there be must be made through loophole above be that bar removed methinks be wide enough for to squeeze through doubtless hazard have not occurred to seeing that be nigh twelve foot above floor that single man must by possibility reach with two of there be difficulty now ralph do stand against wall will climb upon shoulder standing there can reach bar so haul up look out be soon done walter seizing bar hauled up so that must see through loophole be a thought said water of somme be foot below level of window river be yellow swollen few hour heavy rain must bring above level of sill stand steady ralph be coming down again when reached ground said take off belt ralph if buckle mine together passing round bar will make loop upon can stand at window see how best can loosen bar constantly wet a be be likely that mortar will have softened in case will have little difficulty in working out plan be at once put into execution belt be fastened together walter standing on ralph shoulder passed one end around bar buckled to other thus making loop three foot in length putting foot in be able to stand easily at loophole be put in with mortar at top ralph mortar have rotted with wet at bottom lead be poured in when bar be set must be scooped out before can be moved fortunately knight gave order to men to remove dagger when be thrust in here will speedily dig out lead must come down first for strap prevents working at foot of bar must tear off strip of clothing make shift to fasten strap half way up bar so a not to slip down with weight in order to accomplish walter have to stand upon ralph head to gain additional height presently after several attempt succeeded in fixing strap firmly against bar half way up then placing one knee in loop putting arm through bar to steady set to work at lead sharp point of dagger quickly cut out that near surface farther down hole narrowed task be much more difficult several time ralph relieved at work at last be accomplished bar be found to move slightly when shook there now remained only to loosen cement above be comparatively easy task crumbled quickly before point of dagger bar be soon free to move now walter said have to find out whether bar be first put in from below from above one hole other must be good deal deeper than iron so that be either shoved up pushed down until other end must get under over other hole must think most likely hole be below a if held up bar against top when lead be poured in must fill up space so will first of try to lift must stand on head again to enable to be high enough to try head be strong enough warrant ralph replied will fold up jerkin put on for in truth hurt somewhat when be tying strap to bar walter effort did not succeed in raising bar in slightest therefore concluded that have be inserted here lifted while space be filled with lead be best so said must have to cut away stone above below can work much better below now will put knee in strap again set to work stone seems greatly softened by wet will yield to dagger readily enough be already getting dark a soon a have finished can start a walter have discovered stone be rotten with action of weather although a got deeper became much harder yielded to constant chipping with dagger in two hour ralph who at moment happened to be engaged announced to walter that dagger have found way under bottom of bar groove be soon made deep enough for bar to be moved out hour work be necessary somewhat further to enlarge upper hole so a to allow bar to have sufficient play fortunately be only inserted about inch half in stone amount to be cut away to give sufficient play be therefore not large then at last be ready for flight chapter xvii capture of calais when bar be once ready for removal captive delayed not minute for although be now so late that there be little chance of visit being paid be just possible that such might be case that might occur to knight that must be safer to separate now ralph do go first since be lighter can climb up by mean of strap can hold from above push bar out lay down quietly on thickness of wall splash might attract attention of sentry though doubt whether must for wind be high rain falling fast unbuckle strap before move bar a otherwise might fall must have difficulty in handing to again now be steady against wall ralph seized bar with great effort pushed bottom from moved through groove without much difficulty needed great wrench to free upper end however be done laying quietly down pulled up thrust through loophole be desperate struggle to get through for be only just wide enough for head to pas be so squarely built that body with difficulty followed wall be four foot wide a loophole widened considerably without there be when have once passed through from inside space enough for to kneel down lower one end of strap to walter latter speedily climbed up getting through slit with much le trouble than ralph have experienced for although in height width of shoulder be equal be le in depth than follower joined in opening ralph sitting with foot in water in order to make room for dungeon be upon western side of castle consequently stream must be with in making for shore be pitch dark knew that distance must have to swim must not exceed forty fifty yard keep along close by wall ralph if once get out in stream might lose way will skirt wall until end then there be cut for a saw when entered moat run right across neck if keep bit farther down then land will be fairly beyond outwork ralph slipped down into water followed by walter swam along at foot of wall have already be deprived of armour have luckily contrived to retain dagger in belt have again girdled on before entering water stream hurried rapidly along have only to keep afloat be soon at corner of castle few stroke farther again felt wall lined moat stream still swept along felt masonry come to end bush shrub lined bank be beyond outer defence of castle still little farther proceeded down stream in order to prevent possibility of noise might make in scrambling up being heard by sentinel on outer postern then when felt quite safe grasped bush speedily climbed bank looking back at castle saw light still burning there short a be time have be in water be chilled to bone for be month of february water be bitterly cold can not be more than nine o'clock now walter said for be not more than four hour since darkness fell be not likely to visit dungeon before eight nine tomorrow so can rely upon twelve hour start if make best of time ought to be far on travelling on night like through strange country must that star be shining however direction of wind rain will be guide to will soon strike road traveled yesterday can follow till morning be not long before found track then started at brisk pace along night struggled on through wind rain until first dawn enabled to see object in surrounding country making for forest extended to within mile of road entered deep into shelter there utterly exhausted threw down on wet ground after few hour of uneasy sleep woke taking place near edge of forest watched for passage of party might be in pursuit until nightfall none came along have not discovered flight ralph said at last must have passed long before sir phillip doubtless imago that be drowned water be within few inch of sill when started must soon have flooded dungeon did trouble to look in morning be unlikely enough seeing that must be sure of fate must be unable to descend stair must not reach to door so discover that bar have be removed motive may have be in compassing death be doubtless satisfied that have attained need have further fear of pursuit from rain have ceased think that will be fine night will walk on if come across barn will make free to enter stripping off clothing to dry will sleep in hay pursue journey in morning from travel stained appearance who may meet will take for two wayfarer going to take service in army at amiens be not until nearly midnight that came upon place a sought then after passing little village found shed standing apart entering found that be tenanted by two cow groping about presently came upon heap of forage taking off outer garment lay down on covering thickly with shed be warm comfortable be soon asleep awaking at daybreak found that clothes have dried somewhat sun be not yet up when started soon rose ere noon garment have dried felt for first time comfortable met few people on road passed with ordinary salutation have by time left amiens on right by nightfall be well on way towards calais early in morning have purchased bread at village through passed walter norman french being easily understood exciting surprise suspicion at nightfall slept in shed within mile of ruin of castle of pres late next evening entered english encampment at new town after going to tent where ralph changed garment partook of hearty meal walter proceeded to pavilion of prince who hailed entrance with greatest surprise why sir walter exclaimed what good saint have brought here have hour since received message from count of evreux to effect that be prisoner in band of sir phillip de holbeaut with whom must treat for ransom be purporting to send off herald tomorrow to ask at what sum held now appear in flesh blood before first before tell story must congratulate on gallant defence of castle of pres be accounted by a one of most valiant deed of war when two day passed without messenger from coming hither feared that be beleaguered started that evening with six hundred men at arm arrived at daybreak to finding only smoking ruin luckily among crowd of dead upon breach found one of men at arm who still breathed after cordial have be given wound stanched be able to tell story of siege needed not tale to tell how staunchly have defended castle for hundred of dead who lay outside of wall still more mass who piled breach many who lay in castle yard spoke for of valour with castle have be defended a keep be gutted by fire man must tell nought of what have happened after have be stricken down at breach knew not whether brave garrison have perished in flame saw penthouse beneath have laboured to cut through wall work have ceased before hole be large enough for entry hoped that might have seen that further resistance be in vain have made term for life indeed heard from country people certain prisoner have be taken to amiens rested one day at pres next rode back here forthwith despatched herald to count of evreux at amiens asking for news of garrison now have returned with word that twenty four men at arm fifty eight archer be prisoner in count hand that be ready to exchange against equal number of french prisoner that with man at arm be in keeping of sir phillip of holbeaut with whom

to holbeaut thanks royal highness for generosity walter replied there be ransom to be paid then proceeded to narrate incident of captivity at holbeaut escape from castle narration be frequently interrupted by exclamation of surprise indignation from prince knight present well well nigh pass belief prince exclaimed when have concluded be outrage upon law of chivalry honour what must have induced caitiff knight instead of treating with courtesy honour until ransom arrived to lodge in foul dungeon where have not made escape death must have be brought about very night by rising water must be think that brain be distraught by loss injury may have befallen at hand during war worked up to blind passion of hatred against englishman think not that royal highness walter replied manner be cool deliberate altogether free from sign of madness moreover must seem that have specially marked down beforehand since a have told have bargained with count of evreux for possession of person must escape with life at capture of castle seems rather a if must have have private enmity against although what cause may be can not imagine seeing have never to knowledge before met have only heard name by common report be cause prince said will have satisfaction for will beg king father to write at once to phillip of valois protesting against treatment that have received denouncing sir phillip of holbeaut a base dishonoured knight whom must fall into hand will commit at once to hangman upon following day walter be called before king related to in full incident of siege of captivity escape

from king of france saying that have inquired into matter have sent seneschal who have questioned sir phillip holbeaut of men at arm in castle that found that king edward have be grossly imposed upon by fictitious tale sir walter somers have found be treated with knightly courtesy believing to be honourable knight true to word slight watch have be kept over have basely taken advantage of trust with man at arm with have escaped from castle in order to avoid payment of ransom have now invented gross wicked charge against sir phillip holbeaut a cloak to own dishonour walter be furious when heard content of letter king black prince be le indignant although doubted not for moment walter begged that ralph might be brought before examined strictly a to what have taken place in order that might see that statement tallied exactly with have made when have be done walter obtained permission from king to despatch cartel to sir phillip de holbeaut denouncing a perjured dishonoured knight challenging to meet in mortal conflict at time place that might name at same time king despatched letter to phillip of valois saying that statement of french knight follower be wholly untrue begging that time might be appointed for meeting of two knight in list to king phillip replied that have ordered private quarrel in france to be laid aside during progress of war that so long a english foot remained upon french soil must give countenance to knight throwing away life owed to france in private broil must wait sir walter see king said until may perchance meet in field of battle in mean time to show how lightly esteem foul charge brought against how much hold honour bravery showed in defending castle son prince entrusted to a well a upon other occasion hereby promote to rank of knight banneret event now passed slowly before calais queen philippa many of lady crossed channel joined husband added much to gaiety of life in camp garrison at calais be be known in sorest strait for want of food at last news came that king of france with huge army of men be moving to relief have gathered at hesdin at rendezvous king have arrived in early part of april be not until th of july that whole army be collected marching by slow step advanced towards english position king edward have taken precaution to guard approach to city ground be in most place too soft sandy to admit of construction of defensive work fleet be drawn up close inshore to cover line of sand hill by sea with arrow war machine while passage of marsh extended for considerable distance round town be guarded by earl of lancaster body of chosen troop while other approach to city be covered by english camp french reconnoitering party found way open to attack english unless under grievous disadvantage cardinal of tusculum st john st paul endeavoured to negotiate term of peace commissioner on side met term offered by phillip be however by mean so favourable a edward after own victorious operation of army in brittany guienne have right to expect negotiation be broken off following day french king sent in message to edward saying that have examined ground in direction in order to advance give battle have found no mean of doing so therefore summoned king to come forth from marshy ground in be encamped to fight in open plain offered to send four french knight who with four english of same rank must choose fair plain in neighbourhood according to usage of chivalry edward have little over men with same evening that phillip challenge be received body of fleming english detached from army

answer to french king saying that agreed to proposal enclosed safe conduct for four french knight who might be appointed to arrange with same number of english place of battle odds be indeed enormous french being four to one edward after success of cressy have be won by black prince division bore still smaller proportion to force engaging might well feel confident in valour of troop envoy on arriving at french camp found that phillip have apparently changed mind declined to discus matter with be charged spoke only of term upon edward must be willing to raise siege of calais a have authority on subject english knight returned to camp where news be received with great disappointment so confident did feel in power to defeat huge host of french even greater be astonishment next

pursuit harassed retreating army on march towards amiens satisfactory reason ever have be assigned for extraordinary step on part of french king have be for month engaged in collecting huge army have now opportunity of fighting english in fair field with force four time a great a own only mean indeed of accounting for conduct be by supposing affected by temporary aberration of mind many other fact in history render not improbable fit of rage so frequently recorded of border upon madness number of strange action highly detrimental to own interest committed can only be accounted for a act of diseased mind view have be to extent confirmed by fact that le than century afterwards insanity declared among descendant few hour after departure of french french standard be lowered on wall of calais news be brought to edward that governor be upon battlement desired to speak with officer of besieging army sir walter manny lord bisset be sent to confer with found that object be to obtain best term must english knight knowing determination of king on subject be forced to tell that possibility existed of condition being granted that king demanded unconditional surrender reserving to entirely right whom to pardon whom to put to death governor remonstrated on severe term said that rather than submit to soldier must sally out die sword in hand sir walter manny found king inexorable strict law of war in day justified barbarous practise of putting to death garrison of town captured under such circumstance calais have be for many year nest of pirate vessel issuing from port have be scourge to commerce of england flanders king be fully determined to punish severely sir walter manny interceded long boldly represented to king that none of soldier must willingly defend town on

degree demanded that six of most notable burgher of town with bare head foot with rope about neck key of fortress in hand must deliver up for execution on condition agreed to spare rest with term sir walter manny returned to sir john of vienne governor left battlement proceeding to market place ordered bell to be rung famished despairing citizen gathered haggard crowd to hear doom silence followed
