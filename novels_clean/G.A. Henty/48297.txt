of cricket know nothing of music well father know have said many time that like musical woman be not fond of though like woman who can play accompaniment to good old english scotch irish song a for woman who be always strumming on piano think that be bore of worst kind so wo say much about music then must not make garment for to save life there be more necessary accomplishment on frontier than

barrack life wish have be boy instead of girl nita said rather wish so too nita a boy must have be obliged to go home work desperately hard to get commission think have better be contented with matter a be if ca turn out soldier can at least make lady of nita made little grimace showed that prospect did not delight what be use said of being able to hit ace of diamond ten time following at twelve pace be not impossible that may be of use if come out here again be more than probable that will be soldier wife in country such a be by mean unlikely that skill with pistol may be of use to remember in mutiny how woman fought at side of husband there have be more than one massacre since have be here such event might occur again at present moment tribe be restless may break out in general insurrection at time however be a may be young carter will take leave go down country in month time will place under care nita laughed must rather say father that must place under care for be most stupid man in regiment major smiled be not popular nita be good honest young fellow doe say much certainly a talk enough for two have doubt that will get on very well when be once in railway carriage on way down south will be able to look after when get to bombay see about passage make general arrangement for comfort know one in regiment to whom must rather trust well father a say so of course must go if be only for six month must not mind for want to see sea shipping of course will be new to in england have doubt that aunt will be very kind make allowance for deficiency will be terrible work saying good bye to when have never be separated even for day will promise will do best to be trained up to be lady will have to go to school certainly dear will ask aunt to find first rate finishing school to can be sent for three year that be in england except for holiday girl will think that be little savage have heard say that go out for walk two by two like awkward squad being

gymnastics will ask aunt to choose one of sort will be better nita said more cheerfully at rate think that will be able to hold own dare say will feel very happy when have be settled there for time great point be to make best of thing be big girl for age be a tall a many village girl at sixteen if be bright cheerful will soon make liked naturally in school there be one two disagreeable girl there will be reason why must quarrel with nita threw back head have better not quarrel with said know have have lesson in boxing why little savage said suppose in finishing school for girl use fist against other gave permission to learn to box for think well that man woman must be able to protect if necessary moreover boxing give quickness of thought doubtless improves pose figure if be to hit girl at school must lead to instant expulsion woman fight with word not with fist think after constant verbal skirmish with officer that will be able to hold own think so father nita said oh yes think will get on very well at school on following day major marched away told daughter that must probably be back in fortnight take care of shouted a waved hand before giving order to start expect to hear when come back that have be doing junior subaltern work to lieutenant carter a soon a force be beyond gate went up to lieutenant heard sir said saluting in military fashion that father have deputed to act a sub young man looked at in surprise understood that major be joking miss ackworth partly in jest partly in earnest sir said calmly one white officer to fifty men be quite enough under ordinary circumstance might not be enough here if be attacked in force by pathan might not be of use in directing men movement have own native officer for in case of trouble must keep watch carry order for act a hospital nurse do end of thing trust that there will be necessity at for effort in direction look here charlie said if be way take well meant offer will withdraw said in tone of contempt think be quite right to do so miss ackworth think there be most remote chance of service being called into requisition know said somehow other have sort of uneasy conviction that there be trouble brewing lieutenant face changed expression instantly have reason for idea asked with sharpness directness differing widely from usual manner can not quite say have still there be sundry little thing might afford foundation for to begin with know that thirty of camp follower went off week ago why must have done that be always well treated there have be grumbling among yet without moment notice stole away just before gate be closed at night yes miss ackworth discussed that matter among ourselves came to conclusion that men thought wanted change have gone off to village yes of course might have meant that heard talking over when be sitting in veranda outside bungalow thought be very stupid because only seemed to have one idea between why must have given several reason at least men belong to hill tribe have doubt have inkling that expedition be going to start so went to join friend took heard half dozen rifle with must certainly seem to show that have intention of returning here well be one solution other be that raid that father have gone out to punish be really feint to get to take greater part of garrison away during absence to fall upon nail young lieutenant looked at nita gravely what suggest be quite possible never thought of before think major can have done so must have left more of force here beg pardon miss ackworth see that in case supposition turn out to be correct will make very useful subaltern at once accept offer in direction trust sincerely that fear will not come to anything at rate will at once take precaution in power forewarned be forearmed know be right sir said saluting again hope that when be assigning place in defence to everyone else will not forget be a good with rifle a anybody a know be pretty certain shot with revolver if came to close fighting must not waste much ammunition will remember said with slight smile must say that to begin with place must be in one of officer bungalow will turn into hospital there will be plenty of work for there if be attacked again apologize for having treated first proposal so lightly oh never mind about charlie be glad that be that left behind for most of other officer must only have chaffed then must have got into rage greatly satisfied returned to father bungalow set to going through belonging putting aside old garment must find must be torn up used for dressing charlie carter at once called up two native officer told that did not consider fort safe from attack while troop be away soldier be formed up with made tour of wall telling off man to twenty yard additional men to point be weakest most open to attack will let men off duty day see that be ready for work at night there will be occasion for to remain on guard will station third of at post change three time during night not on sentry will sleep with rifle beside magazine charged so a to be ready at once if alarm be given one of by turn will be on night duty to see that sentry be vigilant that be going on quietly troop who be off duty will of course hurry to take respective post on wall must alarm be given by day officer appeared in way surprised at order there have be discussion among on previous evening about fort being left so slenderly guarded be pleased to see that officer be determined not to be caught napping tour of inspection be made man be instructed in position that be to occupy in case of assault weakest spot be gateway be commanded by native mosque hundred yard away several low building surrounding wish must pull that place down said to nita be more than can venture to do when have really nothing to go upon major have always said that if be going to be attacked must not hesitate to level to ground must not venture to do so unless danger be imminent a destruction must be bitterly resented by people round think charlie that if be to plant couple of barrel of powder under lay train by must be fired that must smash up pretty completely have large store of powder can spare two three barrel for purpose be capital idea miss ackworth will carry out to night when people in village be asleep upon word if be in accordance with military discipline must feel disposed to hand over command to for brain work quicker than mine doe by long way be quite content to serve under said dare say will have other suggestion to make later on doubt will be possible others contrary will submit for approval rejection knowing very well that of must be impracticable now look here will find frightfully dull taking meal by suppose will find lively so wish must join on veranda of bungalow know miss ackworth whether father must quite approve of nonsense girl laughed know be not in way to be regarded a young lady yet besides father be going to send very soon down to bombay from there to england under escort show that considers prudent trustworthy guardian for if be at home day by be sure must get jump brain be always busy a father representative here think ought to be able constantly to confer with be sure will be more pleasant for to sit in veranda smoke pipe put up with chatter than must be for to be moping by in ante room if like will promise to talk a childishly a can with due respect to a commander of garrison carter laughed very well miss ackworth must certainly be great deal more pleasant for must take responsibility when major return will do that said father must see that must be ridiculous for to be taking meal alone time that be away do know charlie nita said on second evening have always thought rather slow now see that be really nothing of sort carter laughed be quite conscious that be slow miss ackworth be not quick in taking in idea in expressing own often wish that be so have lately be getting better ca chaff a most of can find able to join in general conversation more easily day dare say will become quite conversationalist how very serious be said talk with a if be woman not a most of others do a little girl to be chaffed chapter ii attacked have got uniform charlie girl asked on following evening certainly have carter answered in surprise well wish must send over here send over here miss ackworth what on earth do want for well be be a well to be prepared for contingency certainly mean to be carried away if fort must be captured made slave of afridi chief if find thing going badly will run back here put on uniform cut hair off short then go out fight till last must be thousand time better to be killed fighting than to be captured certainly must young officer said gravely must be hard lot for woman to be carried off captive by afridis very well then will lend uniform yes will miss ackworth must advise to keep last bullet in revolver for mean to said something might happen might fall seriously wounded be unable to use then if found lying wounded must fire bullet into so finish god forbid that must come to that said though be a well to make provision against be now quite of opinion that there be possibility of being attacked for last two day many of villager have abandoned home cleared off there must be reason for only one can see be that men be aware that be going to be attacked have ground for complaint against have always paid for everything that have have of there have be enforced labour have reason for supposing that be well content to have established here a fort must be protection in case of afridi raid move on part certainly be ominous must be driven from wall hope will not take place suppose that must rally in mess house make last stand there wall be solid have morning set of men who know something of carpentering to work at once to make thick shutter for window to store house with provision think must make stout defence there think be very good plan charlie bugle call must bring men down from wall in time there be building round enemy must have to attack across open believe if only twenty men get there in safety ought to be able to drive off will have good try for anyhow young lieutenant said will know that major will not be many day before be back after one two sharp repulse may deem expedient to move off lest must find table turned upon be rather bloodthirsty little person miss ackworth do think so hope not know very well that if be attacked will be very serious matter fear there will be great loss of life do think that if made trifling attack drew off must enjoy excitement most certainly hope that there will not be regular attack still if there be fancy must in sort of way enjoy must be very wrong have doubt think must help think be way with soldier miss ackworth may feel nervous before action when be once engaged lose sense of fear great anxiety be to get hand to hand with enemy if be not for feeling fancy very few attack must ever succeed man who deliberately said to 'no one must live under storm of bullet a ' must not be likely to march steadily through be funny thing be that men must be so fond of fighting be have wondered over many time savage race love fighting certainly own people do if there be great war hundred thousand of men must volunteer at once be afraid instinct brings very near savage think other nation posse to anything like same extent a british race german be fine soldier fight well do purely because be commanded have to obey frenchman be nearly same think be something like with russian turk now be thorough good fighter with be matter of religious fanaticism be curious that indian subject for most part go into battle with same feeling a do own people there be finer fighter in world than sikh punjaubis ghoorkhas be magnificent be equalled in africa by hausa other tribe from whom draw soldier people go into fray a if be going to feast expect nita said be because have feeling that always win battle doubt be so only hope that feeling will not be knocked out of by school board other contrivance of sort nita shook head be beyond why must do so asked school board train up boy to despise father calling be afraid want to go into shop to get small clerkship to struggle in fact for anything where can wear black clothes instead of fustian still hope wo lose courage that race have always possessed at rate very large number of young fellow who have be to board school become volunteer afterwards thoroughly believe that volunteer must turn out a one man if have very serious war say with france germany must be serious war nita said nation have tremendous army so have heard father say have be in opinion too tremendous if be to fight in solid mass must be literally swept away if fought in open order be now rule with battle must extend over area that general in world must handle army covering such enormous space must say that from hundred to hundred fifty thousand be greatest body must be efficiently worked under one command think french be ever likely to fight way fashoda affair be settled seems to show that ruler be very adverse to plunging into war with when fought at beginning of century have population of five six million while french have six time that number now british island have something like forty million be day increasing while french be stationary if not going back besides if there be big war believe that colonist must if be hardly pushed send million fighting men between germany matter be different be entering field a commercial rival fret that must hold almost land in world where white man can work except of course north america german be uneasy in democracy be making great stride time may well come when german emperor may be driven to quarrel with in order to prevent civil war at home at present however power of emperor be supreme germany be adding to navy for without powerful navy must not hope to get into contact with while build one war ship can build three so that need not fear supremacy at sea being threatened save by alliance between france germany russia alliance there be little fear of coming about for german hate russian russian hate german might a well think of alliance between dog cat rat a three power must pull together next war when come may be between russia a be certain that little jap must join think that between must make thing pretty hot for there miss ackworth have be giving sort of lecture on politics of world hope that did not find dull certainly not nita said be very much obliged to of course have heard thing talked over before never in such way must exactly understand seems funny to be discussing such matter up here on frontier with chance of being attacked hour well must go round good night miss ackworth hope sleep will not be disturbed not indeed girl said have slept soundly night so far there have be so much to arrange work out that go off a soon a lay head upon pillow four hour later sat suddenly up in bed be certainly rifle shot that heard be followed almost instantaneously by heavy roar of musketry have come exclaimed a leapt out of bed hurriedly dressed paused moment a looked at suit of uniform then muttering there will be time enough for later on proceeded to put on own clothes slipped handful of cartridge into pocket with revolver in hand sallied out seemed to that place be attacked on side at once for flash of fire spat out round whole circle of wall be a nothing to roar outside by sound assured that main attack be directed on gate here fire of defender be also exceptionally heavy made way up to top of wall here found greater part of men who have be in reserve although of have a arranged hurried to other threatened point take steady aim men take steady aim lieutenant carter shouted told where be stationed made way to when eye fell on said ought not to be here miss ackworth if thing be going badly with must say nothing against at present at rate have business here must ask to retire at once what do suppose major must say if on return found that have be killed by chance shot on wall must really beg of to descend at once never before have nita heard young lieutenant speak in such tone of command determination all right said meekly just let have one peep over wall then will go down may take just one peep there be nothing to see have failed in expectation that must take by surprise at present be lying down using up ammunition nita took hasty glance over parapet then descending step made way to bungalow have be decided have better be used for wounded a be bullet proof building although le well ventilated comfortable than hospital must have be set to work to light lantern ranged along wall to get out bandage to prepare for reception of wounded two of men have be told off to assist be already there when arrived be not long before first patient be brought in have be severely wounded in head while firing over parapet nita shuddered putting on thick white canvas apron have made on previous day began work surgeon have unfortunately gone with expedition felt that responsibility be heavy one knew little of bandaging having be present when doctor have given lecture to officer on subject be case altogether beyond must only bathe man head then put loose bandage round gave drink of water then sat suddenly down on next bed faint sick held out hand to one of men for glass of water drank up then with great effort got on to foot again waited for next patient five six more men be brought in during night have be hit either in head shoulder of however be only gashed in cheek a soon a wound be bandaged took up rifle went off again to wall so night passed fire have slackened good deal be evident that afridis have abandoned idea of taking fort by assault although be two o'clock when attack have begun night seemed endless to nita be grateful indeed when first tinge of daylight appeared in east presently carter arrived have done well indeed miss ackworth said have be far more useful than must have be on wall required deal of nerve to carry out work look show what strain have be beg that will go lie down for time men have come down from wall good many of be adept in art of bandaging wound having be enlisted among fighting tribe bandaging have be really effective men will make neater job of illustration suddenly sat down on next bed faint sick how be thing going on asked very well have fallen back now to mosque village doubt will spend morning in consultation have not fired off barrel then oh will keep that a pill for when matter become more serious now please go lie down of course if there be fresh attack will get up come out again nita walked slowly across yard to room why be leg so ridiculously weak said to herself be sure have not be afraid a to work of bandaging poor fellow be nothing suppose be sight of blood having to wait so long for something to do be sure must have borne ten time better if mr carter have allowed to remain on wall must not have thought must have be overruled by what said spoke so sternly sharply felt must obey must not have believed that charlie must have spoken so will not be so quick in forming opinion about people again think spoke of a betupid when father said be to take down country see that there be nothing stupid about be very quiet certainly take command a if have be accustomed to life be quite certain that if anyone can defend place can how silly of forgot to ask be strength of force attacking however will keep till get up so saying lay down on bed dressed a be in two minute be fast asleep be eleven o'clock when woke did not think must have slept five minute said indignantly to here have have nearly six hour dipped face in water brushed hair made a tidy a possible when went out lieutenant carter be talking to two native officer waited till saluted retired then went up to please tell little more about mr carter how many be there of attacker what do think be going to do did kill many of three question at once said with smile to none of can give satisfactory answer in first place be very strong have put down a having fifteen hundred men a to intention can tell nothing yet for there have be development thirdly think that must have killed fifty at first rush at gate be pure surmise for carried off body a fast a fell be waiting somewhat eagerly to see what next move will be have heard outburst of yell twice in last hour expect that will soon see result be long odds girl said very long answered lieutenant for there be doubt that be preconcerted thing attack be made on outlying post considerable distance from fort probably only with intention of getting garrison to march away while assembled tribe came down upon feeling doubt that with benefit of surprise knowing how small garrison must be must be carried at first rush now that have failed will doubt adopt quite different tactic have have men at work ever since daybreak piling up sack full of earth against gate to within two three foot of top where have made loophole so that men can lie down on sack keep up heavy fire be can do at present until see what game mean to play be capital girl said if make real attack be position where will place there will be chance of being hit there at distance must calculate on bringing down enemy at shot be afraid that be very wilful young person said with smile a know how good shot be will not refuse aid in case of extremity chapter iii hard pressed towards daylight next morning tremendous fire opened suddenly nita dressed hastily ran out running up to wall saw that large number of men be approaching gate covered by rain of bullet from mosque village that a seemed to equally strong attack be being made from other side punjaubis be hard at work from number of dead covered ground behind enemy felt how accurate fire have be time afridis seemed to have worked up to pitch of fanatical bravery two three time halted for minute leader came to front waving flag led forward again at last in spite of fire of twenty five men on side reached gate at began to hack with heavy knife dozen men now ran down from wall climbing up barricade opened fire through loophole on mass below causing terrible destruction among men who must not get at gate opened fire at loophole be not long before two of defender fell shot through head nita at once went up took place of one of two men who have be killed be lying next to other taking careful aim from one loophole fired man dropped then shifted place to next vacant loophole fired from that sometimes lay still for two three minute then fired several shot in rapid succession from loophole sometimes using one sometimes other thus avoiding storm of bullet followed shot have sense of fear now be proud of doing share of work that be doing share knew for scarcely one of shot missed mark presently men before gate began to sneak off in five minute more be over afridis suffering heavily a retreated across open then nita went down into courtyard a did so saw carter run across court to other side where combat be still raging mounted wall short distance away enemy have brought up great faggot thrown down against foot of wall giving slope almost to top up have again again rushed only to be beaten back time by punjaubis fortunately faggot be insufficient to reach quite to top of wall afridis have to help comrade up eight foot between crest top of parapet only to see fall back shot bayoneted arrival of ten men from gate turned table with thirty rifle playing upon afridis felt that more must be done retired sullenly taking advantage of bit of rising ground bush to lie down fire well miss ackworth that affair be over saw standing at distance be thankful that did not come up to join did fighting on other side said with smile know said that did said angrily will have to put under arrest miss ackworth for disobeying order thank happens that did not disobey order particularly said that might fire through loophole of gate when be seriously attacked took advantage of permission to get possession of two hole where defender have be killed flatter did good fired thirty shot know enough of shooting to be sure that there be not many of thrown away circumstance be exactly what pointed out gate be very seriously attacked be therefore open to to do little shooting on own account be really wrong of miss ackworth attack be serious never thought for moment that must take gate certainly never entered mind that must expose to being killed in way took precaution charlie fired sometimes from one loophole sometimes from a must have accounted for quite twenty five men honestly believe that at least did a much a of soldier probably good deal more be very well said say that did not do good service admit that order did give sort of license however must not occur again will consider duty to order to keep place in hospital will have to put sentry at door to prevent from coming out under pretence while fighting be going on must remember that will have to account for safety to major when return be anything to happen to blame must fall upon shoulder must not be put down to wilfulness however must time ever come when be driven to last corner will then authorize to use pistol glad to have got off so easily nita went down to hospital there be few wounded a before have be hit principally on head shoulder lieutenant carter came in shortly afterwards let have look at patient miss ackworth have gone through st john ambulance course be pretty good at bandaging see that have taken great pain with men think that can possibly make little improvement here there besides in case may be able to get ball out will be more than week before surgeon be back with father extracting bullet might make difference between life death have brought in case of instrument doctor left behind do think that must help certainly must said think first attack of weakness will be last well then let set to work with two three of patient ball have penetrated too deeply where have lodged comparatively close to surface carter managed to find position with probe in four case succeeded in getting out patient behaved with heroic fortitude although operation be necessarily painful bore without murmur when work be done wound bandaged again said now nita little fresh air must do good come with up to rampart be going to try effect of explosion be certain that enemy be gathered now in mosque village possibly after defeat of morning blow will disconcert altogether send to right about must think must nita agreed what loss did suffer morning do think must say at least hundred fifty of bravest men went together to spot where train of gunpowder ended go on to wall said watch will run up a soon a have lighted fuse calculated that must last five minute before fire train of gunpowder nita ran up to wall minute later be joined by officer took out watch counted minute a went past now miss ackworth said putting watch into pocket again fuse ought to be done in forty second must allow minute two for miscalculation in length two minute passed then there be deep roar mosque came down like house of card many of dwelling collapsed from shock of explosion timber stone flew up high into air there be moment pause then outburst of wild yell scream think that ought to frighten bit lieutenant said unless leader have great power over be man of iron nerve will be off worst of be wo like to return home to face woman after disaster that have suffered without having obtained great success men scarcely know what nerve mean may very well make up mind to try one last attempt may be sure will be formidable one if do will probably adopt entirely new scheme will have to be doubly cautious for next two night although sharp look out be kept there be sign of enemy retreating towards evening scattered fire be opened from village against gate otherwise night passed quietly like carter said next morning enemy have not gone yet have not renewed attack have doubt that beggar be up to something wish knew what be worry doe seem strange nita said perhaps have be burying dead must keep pretty well occupied day however a have beaten off twice with loss to ourselves of only six killed eight wounded suppose that will be able to resist again be sure will if attack openly be only unknown be afraid of be on wall whole night except for continued random fire from village be quiet wish have moon in case must make out comfortably at hundred yard whereas on dark night one ca see twenty officer prevision of danger told upon nita when reached bungalow night dressed in carter uniform cut hair carefully close to head lay down in readiness to leap up at first alarm have anyone be keeping special watch in courtyard must have seen number of dark figure clustering between wall hospital during preceding night party of afridis have gathered at foot of wall crawling forward one by one on stomach be armed only with spear knife with have attacked wall noiselessly working stone out one by one unobserved undreamt of by watch on wall above first night have almost completed work by three in morning on second have made opening through two men must pas abreast then one have gone back to village presently stream of men be passing through wall when be ready burst out with triumphant yell be however ignorant of position of various house scattered miscellaneously moment later bugle sounded twenty men in reserve at once made rush to mess house defender of wall came running down various step leading from battlement many of be cut down on way twelve of managed to join comrade at mess house nita sprang up when first yell broke out seized revolver box of cartridge have reached mess house just a party in yard came in door be kept open until last fugitive entered desperately wounded followed by mob of exulting afridis who however be prevented from entering building man have be instructed a to place must occupy in case be driven from wall punjaubis took up position in stern silence where be lieutenant carter nita asked have anyone seen be here miss ackworth thank god be here too be one of last to come in for hung round bungalow to help if necessary candle lantern have be placed on table nita took match box from pocket lit several of hullo miss ackworth be that really said astonished lieutenant a soon a light be struck really truly said rather scared yesterday by talk so got into uniform before lay down did well said must certainly take for lad who have just joined regiment well must not stay here first thing be to go round rearrange post for have little more than original number now will only leave three four men on floor at present will at once open fire from upper window will be much obliged if will stay down here certainly will do so will place near main door will let know if enemy seem to be collecting for attack upon be brave girl said wish have two three dozen like afridis at once pulled down barricade from front gate tribesman swarmed in very soon however be obliged to take shelter in various building for galling fire from window of mess house rendered impossible for to stay in open at daylight firing ceased altogether refreshment be served out to troop lieutenant nita sat quietly down to breakfast there be disguising said position be very critical one in first place have idea how rascal got into fort have certain idea at charlie think that in dark must have somehow cut hole through wall must think that be something of sort certainly did not get over must not have done so without being seen by sentry that must have got in have certainly changed position greatly for worse have shown amazingly determined enterprising have doubt will fill house whose window bear on ours keep up such fire that will not be able to show under cover of fire will attack may kill great many of fear that in long run will come to same thing only hope think lie in chance that major have received news of attack upon have abandoned idea of expedition be hurrying back to relief god grant that may arrive to day at latest to morrow be use shutting eye to fact that position be very grave one nita have already seen yet turned little pale at companion word well said be glad indeed put on uniform one can be killed once if fail to kill will do myself only thing that trouble be thought of father returning finding dead eye filled with tear be awful can say nothing to comfort said sadly must keep up other courage till last there will be no great occasion to keep up yours though for be pluckiest girl that ever saw a for own courage be in command here must keep up brave face matter what may think be afraid that be not so brave a seem to be be a much a can do really to keep from breaking down cry be only natural nita if must like to have good cry will leave to yourself for hour oh mean that be going to for if began to cry know when must stop added with attempt at smile must shake hand will want to be a steady a can think that can promise shot will tell time dare say seems horrid to must be so bloodthirsty hate so for coming down attacking like must kill with one blow if must wish must very heartily said with smile have be great friend to went on taking hand high spirit have kept up know what must have done without be that thought of blowing up mosque must say must have accounted for great number of not to mention brought down with pistol have forgiven speaking so sharply to hope have never thought of since be quite right to blow up felt that at time yes have be great friend have told score score of time what little fool be to have thought that be rather stupid because talked so little did seem to care much for entering into amusement of others know be not what call good comrade must not help fancy be shy did not care much for of sport besides knew that regarded rather a killjoy kept from mixing with much well have have turn now charlie one must have come out of more splendidly will be great soldier day if stopped if live yes hoped day to have got chance of distinguishing chance have come a say be unlikely that will ever come again a also said one can die once at least hope that will die with credit soldier can wish more must give few hour may have left to to know that must escape be nonsense charlie be only girl girl life be not worth anything if be for father must be fairly content well said be use talking will have to do best can when time come must go round see after men chapter iv prisoner there be short cessation of hostility then from building round blaze of musketry burst out men be at once called down from upper room where there be shutter planted at loophole of on ground floor throw away shot be order given to keep well in shelter when do fire take care that bring down man so fight went on day loss of enemy be far greater than of garrison men lost to latter must be ill spared be awful to think of fate of in hospital nita said when took hasty meal in middle of day with lieutenant carter four five of managed to get in here alive rest must have be massacred in cold blood fret over nita may be fate of of in few hour will sell life dearly can not shut eye to fact that enemy be not far off big rush then door will give way for have mean of strengthening a there be two entrance at back a well a in front nothing return of major can save there be doubt that in spite of loss enemy be determined to capture place have now only eighteen men left capable of firing rifle be fifty to one against be of use disguising from to night will see end of fight if must be so must nita said quietly think that anyone be likely to see be girl certainly not disguise in way be complete perhaps have better allow to trim hair a closely a can to masculine style there be more chance for than for men for be just possible that may take carry off a hostage mean that will keep a slave till be attacked in such force that may think prudent to make term chance be against there be possibility that be course will take must rather die than nita said might keep up disguise for time must be sure to detect sooner later dare not think of believe that must be detected nita must not penetrate disguise if who know can not do so may well pas with ruffian have plenty of spirit may very well sustain character will blow brain out before be taken said passionately have quite made up mind to must be own choice said gravely while there be life there be hope sooner later may be restored to friend sooner than later must guess for may be sure that when news of massacre reach authority will lose time in getting together strong punitive expedition against tribe a soon a find resistance be hopeless will try to make term on strength of hostage that may have in hand nita shook head be very well for to give hope charlie know a well a do that chance be hundred to one against illustration nita have one shot left in revolver directed against forehead at night a soon a became dark there be tremendous rush against four door be of use men carter said in firm tone rose above din door will not hold out five minute will assemble here fight till last have done that men can do thank for way that have stood by odds be too great for have nothing to do now except die like men will find handful a be can account for good many of yet men gathered in ring with carter nita in centre three minute later two crash be heard afridis burst in paused moment on seeing compact little body waiting attack then with yell of triumph rushed at be met with stream of musketry shot of took effect crack of revolver of carter nita added to din in vain enemy endeavoured to break circle then betook to musket ground be speedily piled with dead number gradually prevailed little ring of defender grew smaller smaller at last when six men be standing enemy burst into circle there be wild fighting for minute bayonet against sword spear gradually din ceased carter be one of last to fall nita have one shot left in revolver directed against forehead at moment when be about to draw trigger be felled to ground by blow from butt end of musket then afridis seeing that be over scattered for plunder leaving body of slain where lay daybreak dawned nita opened eye saw that carter two others have be removed from heap of slain placed by closed eye again with shudder yet with feeling of relief removal of three men a well a must have be result of examination of slain like other three must have be found breathing head ached a if must split lay for long time without moving then two men who be evidently chief came up examined there be discussion between then carter be taken away remaining man who be one of native officer be also carried out wound of four be roughly bandaged then carter companion be taken up by four native borne away nita remained for hour by time fort have be completely ransacked then companion be also placed on stretcher carried out of fort be at once set on fire in dozen place water be given tribe then started off nita lay with eye closed day scarcely able even to think for head throbbed a if must split travelled fast did not halt till then be given piece of dry bread little water made effort to eat be useless drank most of water however soaked handkerchief in rest placed on head managed at last to doze off to sleep in morning felt better chief then came up spoke to shook head went away presently returned with one of tribesman who have served in punjaubi regiment who be asked in language nita must speak fairly well be officer in regiment said be relation of major who commanded fort man translated to leader who looked pleased tell that will be servant said will be well treated if give trouble if attempt to escape will be shot at once be translated to nita then went on be very young to be officer be more than boy be young nita replied when one have major for relation one can get commission at much younger age than one otherwise must here be peach said will eat better than bread thank very much nita replied have nothing matter with chief went on except that have big swelling at back of head suppose be knocked down by musket be fortunate for that be supposed to be dead at time for men must not have spared after loss that have inflicted upon by time found that be alive passion have died down be able to show that other three might be much more useful alive than dead be friend other officer seriously hurt nita asked be badly wounded think that will recover also other two so saying turned off went away nita felt most grateful for peach gave couple of to havildar who evidently needed even more than did then sat down ate own slowly sweet juice cooling parched tongue even pain in head seemed to abate somewhat hour later tribe again set off ascended two steep pass at end of sixth day halted in small valley there be several village scattered about foot of ground be cultivated be greeted with shout of welcome by inhabitant who flocked out soon cry lamentation mingled with cheering from woman whose husband have not returned however soon retired to home to grieve in solitude while others went on with dance of triumph tribesman scattered to own village in centre of valley stood strongly fortified house to prisoner be taken day nita have be strong enough to walk pain in head have abated though pressure of cap still hurt chief wife who walked beside husband glanced at prisoner be evidently by mean pleased at being quartered upon when chief explained that must be slave at service looked mollified be taken to small room in upper story then gave large jug signified to that be to draw water from stream ran through valley anxious to please woman who be to be mistress fulfilled mission although feeling very tired with walk woman seemed more gracious when nita returned with burden while have be away chief have explained to value of captive that must either get large sum for restoring to friend might use to arrest progress of large party of troop sent against only to think said a nita went wearily upstairs that slight boy must be officer why with be bravest strongest men who be chief how can expect to fight against when be led by boy like must twist round finger way of english be unaccountable chief said be a say boy though officer not much bigger than with only fifty men have killed nearly three hundred of not one offered to surrender fought to last two two others who have gone with orokzais be only one found breathing when examined dead be strange people men be men fought like lion if have offered to surrender must have given life carried off a captive be good thing to have certain number of prisoner in hand for then can always make peace with countryman be not to be little garrison be determined to die did die however officer be in hand treat well wife will pay to do so rather like fair haired boy have shown very patient plucky volunteered to walk instead of being carried to day think will find very willing cheerful have better be said savagely a to being cheerful care not for one way other if be not willing will soon get taste of stick must advise not to try be in room in last fight saw how steadily straight shot certainly fourteen so of men fell at hand must have saved then if must have done so for never did see lad fight so stoutly fired a deliberately a if be aiming at mark eye shone strangely cheered on men to end be sure that if strike be capable of doing harm at cost to woman muttered to herself be evidently impressed with husband warning also with glance nita have given when ordered to fetch water can cook said one of woman have died since have be away have work on own shoulder be not sure if know anything of cooking chief replied can teach will not be long in picking up now will show thing have brought home sight of various article of spoil completely mollified woman there be large copper cooking pot two small one there be clothes that nita recognized a belonging to carter looking glass dozen knife fork meat chopper of precious thing indeed in afridi village besides outside there be dozen cattle forty sheep chief share of animal picked up at various village in neighbourhood of darlinger chief wife be specially delighted with mirror fixing against wall stood admiring for long time twisting head from side to side grimacing with air of affectation that be a much a nita must do to refrain from breaking into scream of laughter be own said at last turning to chief other two wife have nothing to do with be not even to look into unless give permission chief nodded gravely other two wife have while be going on be occupied with domestic duty in bringing in various good nita made up mind at once that have very bad time be little better than slave a chief left hut wife turned to nita go help others said nita understood action though not word with shrug of shoulder went to help other woman presently large bowl of rice slightly flavoured with condiment be brought in chief who have returned sat gravely down by to eat when have finished head wife seated took share after be satisfied other woman sat down together nita hesitated have now recovered appetite sat down quietly with instead however of grabbing handful after handful a did others took a much a wanted placed on ground in front of quietly began to eat head wife laughed derisively made remark to husband chief be evidently not pleased spoke sternly to nita guessed that said be valuable captive being officer must be fairly treated be of course important that if british army entered valley prisoner must give good account of treatment while captive there woman be without doubt cowed afridis use stick freely on wife be evident that although tyrant in house stood in wholesome fear of husband chief moved across hut took down earthenware plate placed before nita who let see by manner that appreciated act of kindness further signified by gesture that might regard plate a own use upon occasion when meal be over nita assisted to tidy up room then went down with large earthenware jug to stream brought back full of water have not be ordered to do woman nodded to more kindly than have hitherto done seeing that captive be ready to make useful after doing nita returned to room be now nearly dark went chatted to native officer bathed wound gave of food that have put by for get well sooner than can help said woman of house be vixen of worst kind will set to work moment be able to crawl about husband be disposed to be friendly think frightened woman of course must not have understood anything said be sure manner showed that must be safe to touch nita went down early in morning mistress of house have not yet appeared two woman be hard at work grinding meal nita went at once to assistance be clumsy at work share be very inconsiderable still woman be grateful nita must not understand that said by way patted on back shook fist menacingly at room where head wife be sleeping be apparent that hated with deadly hatred recognized in friend animated by same feeling a matter went on quietly for little time nita set to work to pick up language a oppressor evidently thought that must make more use of prisoner if understood what said threw impediment in way suffered nita to chat freely with others while be at work even went so far a to admit to husband that prisoner be very willing to work understood what wanted done still fact that husband have placed nita to extent beyond power galled frequently indulged in violent ejaculation threat be more furious because nita received upbraiding with quiet contempt did not appear even to hear must many time have struck be in truth little afraid of nita be convinced that did attempt to do so lad must regardless of consequence return blow with interest chapter v escaped a nita picked up language heard to delight that carter be recovering from wound that be held prisoner by chief who lived fifteen mile away among mountain learned that captivity be much more severe than hers that while be allowed when not engaged indoors to wander about village be held close prisoner in house of chief a soon a found out became restless must be easy thing for to escape alone idea possessed that ought to do something to free carter seemed almost impossibility one thing be evident must in first place get afridi dress must not be difficult much more serious be question how be to subsist saw that might be work of week possibly of fortnight after got away before must communicate with carter arrange for escape must then need considerable quantity of food also long rope disguise of sort must be required for carter nita began by taking flour meal from storehouse downstairs put in sack hid in bush short distance from house day added to store a swelled took two three goat milk cheese hesitated good deal whether must adopt male female dress finally decided upon man attire did not intend to show by daylight casual glimpse of female on hillside must almost assuredly excite observation suspicion moreover intended to carry rifle if must obtain one must be altogether out of character with dress of woman three week be spent in preparation by end of time sack be a heavy a must lift have from first made up mind that must be necessary to carry off donkey mountain pony intended to sling sack on one side of with skin of water on other sack be about third full of grain third of meal remainder be made up of cheese rough clothes rope have also cut pliant stick four foot in length with notch at end to carry string for must clearly be necessary to shoot note to begin with into window of prisoner room made three four rough arrow tied to bow be now ready first thing be to get hold of pony in order to do once twice day took handful two of grain to pony belonging to one of afridis in short time must come eagerly to when called at last preparation be ended one evening a soon a house be asleep took rifle bag of cartridge from corner where stood then of chief robe down from wall very cautiously unbarred door carrying water skin with closed behind started for hiding place of sack then went to little enclosure where pony be standing calling softly to came at once to gate opened gave mouthful of grain taking hold of mane led to where good be hidden placed two three of cloth folded across back then with difficulty fastened sack water skin on to followed path leading to south for four five mile then struck off in direction of village in carter be confined have chosen moonlight night made way mile without encountering great difficulty then came to piece of country so rough that be compelled to halt at first break of dawn be off again succeeded in crossing crest of line of hill separating valley have left from next down went for distance along place so precipitous that even sure footed pony have difficulty in making way at last came upon small ravine must see broadened out lower down here lay down slept after giving pony two three handful of corn fastening up to bush after time continued journey from description have heard of village knew that stood in strong position on hillside when got down to bottom of ravine again fastened pony up went out into valley be glad to see that water ran down be great relief to for although water skin must last for many day must not suffice very long for pony need walked on five six mile then caught sight of village three mile ahead exactly answered description have gathered of in carter be confined keeping along side of valley taking advantage of spur of hill got to within mile of then ascended slope till reached spot quarter of mile behind village here lay down reconnoitred differed little from one have left consisted of five six fortified house position be strong one a hill in front of sloped steeply down selected clump of scrub mile away wrapping up in blanket lay down to sleep a be already becoming dusk in morning started at daybreak spent day with pony late in afternoon returned again with by midnight be safe in spot have chosen scrub be high enough for pony to stand unseen after giving good feed eating of grain piece of cheese lay down till morning looking round saw clump of rather larger tree in dip mile behind at once moved to for there thought that must be able to light fire without fear of being seen then again started for village found that by keeping to small ravine came down behind must approach within three hundred yard of without running risk of being seen did taking advantage of rock from here nita must see be going on in village men have already driven out cattle other animal to valley woman moved about gossiping one of house be larger than others guessed to be abode of chief for hour lay watching upper window at last to delight saw khaki clad figure come to one of stand for time looking out air be listless a window be at back of house looked up hill there be little to interest now that have ascertained room strolled away again remained for rest of day in wood practising with bow arrow then wrote on sheet of pocket book of have not be deprived look out for at eleven o'clock to morrow night will shoot up string there will be rope attached to strong enough to hold can slide down yours nita at ten o'clock started from hiding place at eleven reached village house be surrounded by wall a hoped gate be unbarred opened quietly going round to back took post a far away from house a must shot arrow on have fastened little note at window opening at third essay be successful arrow went right into room then quietly withdrew be thought certain to see when awoke a room be generally very small must hoped be certain to wake before of people of village entered room carefully closing gate again behind made way back to wood lay down slept till morning passed day in state of feverish anxiety now that success seemed almost certain be far more apprehensive of being discovered than have be before spent day at edge of wood on look out for approaching figure day passed a quietly a others have done a soon a be dark strolled down to look out near village carrying with bow arrow rope seemed to that village must never go to sleep that evening finally became quiet last light be extinguished waited hour to allow occupant of village to settle down then ventured to move in five minute stood opposite to carter window be of course without glass being closed only in cold weather by blanket hanging before moonlight permitted to see figure standing there four time missed before succeeded in shooting arrow into room in minute string attached to be pulled then fastened end of rope to be drawn up by carter minute later slid down a came up to whispered hush led way out through gate ascended ravine not until be two three hundred yard away from tower did stop dear miss nita said by what miracle have managed there be miracle in answered got away naturally be not going to leave without hope that have quite recovered from wound quite said though just at present seem hardly able to use leg for have have exercise except what must get in room eight foot square however dare say that will recover use again before long where be taking to wood mile half away where there be pony provision when get there must discus way must go seems to that must be better to cross river go over opposite hill a far a can make out lead away from frontier be direction in will doubt look for a be sure be looking for must be certain to suppose must go way think will know best for have travelled about country good deal more than have really know what to say in way of thanks began after pause will make very angry if thank at may admit however that girl can be of good sometimes be not meant only to be looked at will never say anything against courage again young officer said now tell how have fared how succeeded in getting away got on fairly well chief wife be harridan husband rather took under protection insisted on having fair treatment think be rather uneasy a to consequence of attack on fort wished to keep in well with so be fairly fed allowed certain amount of liberty in village during day did not seem to have suspicion be likely to try to escape be confident think must not be able to cross mountain alone therefore be able to collect store little by little chief magazine be generally open during day own robbed shamelessly then have to slip away after house be asleep have collected sackful of flour meal grain few cheese for knew might have to live long time before must discover place where be confined even if be lucky enough to do so without much waste of time might have to exist considerable period among hill before got to frontier how on earth must carry weight made friend with pony by treating to handful of grain have difficulty in getting to follow large skin full of water very fairly balanced sack of provision annexed two of chief robe turban four five blanket so start under good auspex of course brought that rope that came down by rifle ammunition be in corner of chief room wish must have brought rifle for there be not one handy be sorry must not get revolver fell to share of someone else when good be taken after fight splendid splendid how did find place where be confined picked up little of language learned that chief in whose hand be lived about fifteen mile away nearly due west that village stood on hillside be strongly fortified be fortunate enough in lighting upon without much difficulty lying short distance away be not long in making out at window rest be of course easy now put command into hand followed order when be in command of fort now have escaped freed have shown capacity that certainly wish to interfere with plan think that what proposed namely that must cross river strike into mountain away from frontier be best must hold on in same direction a long a be able before trying to strike down have doubt search for will be very hot for next week ten day be certain to be pursued on downward track a will make sure that have made off in direction news have also got away will not be long crossing hill to village will have difficulty in connecting two event will think that when catch one that be sure to catch other be wood place where pony be hidden yes have given good meal will be ready to start a soon a have loaded up be fortunate indeed that have moon will therefore have trouble in keeping right direction in five minute be moving made way down to river at nita suggestion kept up stream for about mile then struck across for hill by morning be fifteen mile away in extremely rocky precipitous country here halted for hour then made way downhill found that be in fact travelling along near edge of precipice at whose foot stream ran between lofty cliff so steeply did hill slope down to edge of precipice that must only travel with extreme caution even pony sure footed a be have difficulty in keeping foot at length however slope became more gradual ravine widened out into valley apparently about mile wide mile long chose dip in descent found when arrived at bottom that be completely sheltered from view of anyone passing along valley that ravine be to extent used be evident from fact that few cattle be scattered about think that will be obliged to confiscate one of animal for own use carter said diet of flour grain must be apt to pall little even when varied by cheese eventual success depends on keeping up strength quite agree with nita said one thing be certain however that meat will be of use to until can light fire to cook think that will be able to manage that said see depression look a if have once be water hole be eight ten foot below level of hillside be very place want for cooking will not see fire only light reflected on ground above think if collect stone build circular wall say four foot in diameter few foot high with small opening at foot for feeding fire putting on meat there will be fear of reflection falling on hillside must think that must do very well nita agreed have two hour of daylight a hill be everywhere scattered with rock boulder ought to make considerable progress with oven in time well will please sit down then will collect stone depression be scattered pretty thickly with oh must let do share of work nita said be just a keen to have piece of roast beef a be at rate will gather up smaller stone a soon a becomes dark will go out cut brushwood with sword bayonet have match carter said in tone of dismay have nita said not many dozen so put loose into pocket of tunic so must at once get light in case of sudden attack have time even to think of when afridis broke into fort did think of when got to village for saw that if must make escape must be of great use certainly will be invaluable carter said will get wall up a high a can then spread brushwood over top will help to deaden reflection will allow smoke to escape freely worked very hard till became dark by time rough wall be three foot high now said if will lend sword bayonet will go out meat hunting while collect fuel for cooking for covering over top of oven chapter vi rough travelling carter be away two hour returned carrying prime joint of beef be lucky in finding animal be lying down stalked from behind came upon before must spring on to foot get into motion be good indeed nita said what have done with remainder be fortunately lying near river cut remainder of carcass up into number of piece threw into stream be strong rapid enough to carry away down pas before morning of course owner will light upon blood will most likely put down that beast have be killed by bear from mountain how have be getting on made fire at once have laid in good stock of fuel have got batch of chupaties almost ready for eating must have be better if have have little of beef fat to mix with will be thankful for a be after having eaten nothing unground corn for last four day now will please cut off slice for spitting over fire have never done work of sort be afraid must make very poor hand at in couple of minute four good sized slice of meat be grilling over fire have salt mustard nita said merrily a companion placed two of savoury slice on chupaties a have knife sword bayonet be somewhat clumsy instrument for feeding with be reduced to making unaided use of teeth however meal be merry one spirit rose high at thought that be again free that with good fortune might not be long before rejoined friend after meal be over have consultation on best course to be pursued finally agreed to travel west for time then to turn south towards frontier must thus at least thought farther throw pursuer off track must then only have to run ordinary risk of detection from tribe through whose territory passed discussed prospect for next day march finally decided to take day rest nita have suffered much from anxiety very long journey have told on a spot where then be be well hidden be improbable in extreme that of herdsman passer through valley must be at likely to come upon after meal talk carter made shelter tent of large blanket for nita wrapping up in rug lay down short distance away next day passed quietly have not replenished fire when lay down be necessary to light one in morning a have purposely cooked sufficient to last for couple of day towards evening observed three four herdsman gathered by stream at point where carter have killed bullock night before be evidently greatly puzzled at occurrence from gesture while carter be watching formed conclusion that theory of being carried away by bear did not find much acceptance among however said on returning to nita who have be having nap wo start off on search afternoon before morning will be well away sha' want to repeat offence for little time for store of meat now have ought to last for seven eight day be to say if doe not get bad before must think that up in high altitude must keep for time two hour before daylight be on move water skin be refilled at river put bundle of firewood on top of sack a must be by mean certain of finding water wood on way be so far up hillside by time sun rose that have fear of appearance being noticed by people in valley that have left went on merrily laughing joking be delighted with progress though at time cold be severe in extreme met with sign of pas even smallest track sometimes carter must ascend to point commanded view of line that be following at others came to precipice so steep that have to make detour of mile before found place where descent must be made into ravine a rule be water course covered with boulder of shape size after day of perpetual toil agreed at camp fire at night that must now have got far enough west must strike for south suppose have idea how far frontier be charlie not in slightest even know how far be from darlinger to village for be insensible during most of journey took six day charlie suppose two village where be confined be about same distance from darlinger what rate did travel fancy about forty mile first day considerably le afterwards making somewhere between one hundred fifty two hundred mile yes suppose so of course calculation be mere guesswork may be forty fifty mile out since escaping have only steered by sun may be good deal north south of due west besides have made such bend turn a must make impossible to keep anything like true reckoning however suppose call two hundred mile from here to darlinger will be lucky if travelling among hill have to go twice distance certainly unless get into very different country from through have be travelling so far ten mile day be extreme that can calculate upon in case charlie even if go well will be from forty to fifty day before see dear father think will travel good bit faster than carter said encouragingly everywhere through mountain be valley of of considerable size containing dozen more village of course when come upon must travel at night ought to be able to do from twenty to thirty mile must not have done at first practice have have at work have put into first rate marching condition yes except foot charlie think of poor foot shoe be fast disappearing know what will do when come quite to piece must kill goat make pair of sandal for of skin thank charlie must be first rate still shoe will do for bit yet be little doubtful a to capability a shoemaker well think will do better to morrow from high ridge last crossed must see large valley in front of be not sure saw village then eye be sharper than mine be saw valley failed to make out anything like habitation however in case be not likely to go very fast to morrow for must say that must be still fifteen mile from valley oh well one day will not make very great difference will go on a long a be light enough to see then camp for night go down next day to point low in hill can either camp for night stop twenty four hour certainly vote for halt carter said be sure that deserve how did think valley lay must think from appearance of hill behind that must run north south be right direction for probably when get to other end carter said will find track of sort through can pas into next valley know whether there be much traffic between village if so will have to travel at night if not can risk go on by day hope latter will be case will be bad enough finding way along valley now that there be moon must make very slow work of on track connecting on dark night will have new moon afternoon nita said yes be full night stood at window be fortnight ago to day will be splendid charlie if get even full then will make good travelling ground be crossing over at rate when get into valley will let carry rifle wo insisted on taking know if come to fighting have right to have certainly have a be very much better shot than be will be more valuable in hand than in mine following evening camped three mile from valley next day only moved to spot where commanded full view of thought be twenty mile long contained many village thank goodness there be river running down nita said that will be guide anyhow there be only one two village on bank a far a can see rest be on hillside started a soon a be dark made way down into valley striking river kept along down not keeping close however for course meandered so much that must add very greatly to distance to be travelled there be north star carter said if keep on same hand steer by sha' be very far out plodded steadily on more than once must have walked into village be warned of exact position by barking of dog however after what seemed almost interminable journey arrived at end of valley a morning be breaking found that path ran up hill in front of a soon a have satisfied about position entered grove close by camped there eating chupatie two from store have cooked evening before nita threw down fell asleep at once carter however placed on watch near edge of wood four time during day party of two three men went up path led to believe that next valley must not be far away that good deal of communication be kept up with one be now in late in afternoon nita opened eye looked about for minute two before caught sight of companion at once went up to mean to say charlie that have be watching time while have be asleep be absolutely necessary to keep watch said be very glad to do so be nothing to to miss night sleep be very angry with said insist on taking turn in future now must lie down at once without minute delay sun be already getting low can not have more than three hour before be time to start suppose be not very necessary to stand quite still watch time by mean from point can see well down valley must be able to make out one approaching at distance very well then will get meat cooked be sorry to say that have come to last piece have held out good deal better than expected have doubt that will be able to replenish said there be considerable number of cattle in valley three hour later again set out be in many place very difficult to keep to path have to hark back several time at length began to descend so rapidly that felt that must be small distance from next valley therefore halted sat down till daylight broke then moved away from path to mass of great boulder among lay up for day three more valley be passed in safety carter have succeeded in replenishing supply of meat water skin be regularly filled whenever got chance thing be going on first rate nita said when halted early one morning yes must not expect always to go so well valley be getting larger house be more carefully built be doubt inhabited by increased population see robe that be wearing will do well enough to pas at distance must not bear close inspection next evening emboldened by good fortune started time before sun be down at sudden turn in pas came upon three afridis walk straight on carter said nita happened to be carrying rifle while charlie have be obliged to lead pony men paused when within twenty yard of then sudden exclamation broke from party one raised rifle shouted who be be traveller on way to home twenty mile off lie man said pointing gun at be not native of country nita have thrown rifle forward fired at same instant a native bullet knocked off turban while shot through body with shout of rage other two men raised rifle one fell dead before must get to shoulder other fired shot then fled with agility of deer getting cover in moment round sharp corner of defile be unfortunate there be nothing else to be done carter said now what be best course nita stood minute without speaking then said opinion be that have better find spot to hide a close here a possible hide a close to place a possible carter said in surprise must have thought that have better turn down pas at once push on think so nita said must take a certain that man who have fled will return a quickly a possible with twenty thirty others a will not see on way here will suppose that have returned have taken to hill one side other must never think of searching close here be right carter said what do say to pile of boulder on right will do excellently if can find place among be sure to be able to do by moving two three of have probably got couple of hour to make preparation accordingly set to work at once by using united strength managed to move enough of to make first rate place of concealment for pony animal leg be fastened be made to lie down took place beside carter went down path looked at hiding place from side in order that might feel sure that must not be made out from point close by heap of boulder lay at foot of steep precipice be evident that one from above must approach near enough to edge to look down upon having made sure of returned to hiding place three quarter of hour passed then score of wild figure armed with rifle musket other weapon appeared round corner of pas carter took glimpse at what be going on there be excited conversation of men pointed to hill on side while be evidently of opinion that assailant whoever be have returned to valley beyond finally broke up into three party seven eight men going on side while remainder pushed on along path hour later sixteen men came up also divided half climbing hill on side night be now falling for time shout of searcher must be heard gradually ceased a men abandoned hunt a hopeless for night came down in two three until presently fugitive be convinced that have returned be certainly admirable plan of yours miss ackworth have completely thrown off scent now have better be going moon give enough light to make way must be a far a possible from here before morning when doubt men of valley perhaps one that have just quitted will turn out in search of be quite ready nita said have doubt pony be too sack have be getting lighter lighter day think that have more than thirty forty pound left a have always be able to get water think that there be more than enough in water skin to balance sack be sorry that provision be getting short carter said be immense advantage in climbing about among hill to have such light burden pony ought to be able to make way wherever can so a want to cut adrift from valley must say that have better work round foot of hill in case ought to be well to south of next valley before day break fortunately can have idea who be that be stranger curious one of course know be so far out of road must think escaped prisoner must take that be not at likely that will in way associate with even if have heard of escape be very improbable will therefore have nothing to indicate road be taking really do know of be that have rifle can shoot straight chapter vii skirmish started at once not trying to mount hillside above point where have be hidden to keep along a far a possible at same height after making way painfully for couple of hour came to spot from must see valley below then gradually made way down till only two three hundred foot above bottom then kept along side in still night air must hear many voice knew that coming of mysterious dangerous visitor be being warmly discussed light burned much later than be usual in village at last altogether disappeared ventured still lower keeping however sharp look out for village situated on spur valley be not above eight ten mile long be well past before morning dawned country now entered be little more precipitous rugged than that have recently passed agreed that must be impossible to climb over that must have to make use of pas therefore chose good hiding place distance up on hill be sheltered from behind by precipice at whose foot grew clump of bush of considerable size can not do better than carter said a people will be starting in search of in le than hour have farther time to look for hiding place indeed think that must be likely to find better one if did there be one comfort however numerously turn out will take care not to scatter much in view of lesson gave unless do scatter chance of lighting upon be small indeed suppose heart will be very much in business except on part of relative of men shot who be after a likely to belong to valley left a to one tribesman be good fighter when liberty be threatened be not very fond of putting into danger feel much more comfortable carter continued now be no longer condemned to go about unarmed be grand idea taking rifle of two men shot pony carry one carry other have carried one time yes a be under order to hand over to whenever wanted have not be great satisfaction to now can feel that can play part although martini be not quite a good a lee metford be quite good enough for practical purpose with magazine always in readiness ought to be able to give good account of day passed quietly party of men be seen moving about on hill none came near at night went forward again moved with great caution a be possible that a fugitive must hardly get across mountain afridis might keep watch in pas have crossed highest point be descending when saw rising before by side of path old buddhist temple when within short distance from dozen men jumped out fired volley shot went wide reply be not so futile four men fell rest appalled by heavy loss fled down hill be sharp carter said soon over however be beginning of will carry news down to next valley will be besieged here however fortunately appears to be very steep on side of temple think even afridis firm footed a be will be able to climb hill get behind can no more get up than can at least will give only one side to defend can keep eye on hill pick off who try to make way along top if worst come to worst must retire down pas again to night try to strike out somewhere over hill doe much matter way so that get out of neighbourhood be becoming altogether too hot for daylight be just breaking when number of men be seen coming up pas two fugitive have already ensconced pony in temple have posted at two of narrow window nita shouted keep away will be worse for want to hurt if will leave alone if attack will defend answer be volley of shot to defender of temple did not reply a be anxious not to waste cartridge emboldened by silence enemy gradually approached keeping up steady fire when be within eighty yard defender answered steadily deliberately by time twenty round have be fired enemy be in full flight leaving six dead upon ground while several of others be wounded expect will sicken effectually carter said at rate will not attempt to renew attack until becomes dark again think have better wait hour see what intend doing hour be just up when white figure be seen high up on hillside making way cautiously along face of precipitous hill what be distance do think carter said five to six hundred yard must say suppose be about well must be stopped if possible levelling rifle took long steady aim fired man be seen to start a bullet sung up close to can beat nita said in tone of disgust will try anyhow said range puzzle one man being so far above steadied rifle against stone fired man be seen to disappear behind rock splendid shot carter exclaimed be not sure that hit think fell at flash however there be space between stone boulder ahead of be five minute before movement be seen then man started forward suddenly nita be kneeling with rifle aimed at spot half way between stone a crossed pressed trigger time there be mistake man fell forward on face lay there immovable have doubt that be watching down below when see fall one will care to follow example now think have better be moving must risk meeting people coming over pas if can get over worst of must hide then climb mountain on side appears easiest time be lost be still early for daylight be scarcely breaking when attack have taken place leaving temple started at once travelling a fast a pony must pick way along steep path two hour later saw far in distance two men coming up there be fortunately shelter near here took refuge lay hidden until men have passed then continued journey be three part of way down pas when on right hand side saw slope seemed practicable made way up slowly cautiously till reached plateau mountain still rising steeply in front of travelled along plateau presently saw opening in mountain range halted now lit fire in hollow cooked food then confident that be well beyond area likely to be searched lay down to sleep start be made at daybreak found difficulty of crossing range enormous have frequently to retrace step at last struck head of small ravine decided to follow down late in evening found at spot where ravine widened into valley waited until morning when be able to obtain view down be of very great extent about quarter of mile wide mile long contained few house remained quiet day at moved along valley on side opposite to village found that small stream ran through decided to follow course next morning halting well beyond valley in deep gorge be strange nita said a settled for rest how narrow gorge can have cut way through mountain yes can only be that age since valley be deep lake at time of melting of snow overflowed doubt in place stratum be softer than others here water began to cut groove grew deeper deeper till at last lake be empty then of course work stopped water must run off a fast a fell must have taken enormous time nita said for hill bordering ravine must in place be three four thousand foot deep fully that certainly give wonderful idea of age of world tremendous power exercised by water in dry weather ravine formed chief road of country though doubt be so blocked with boulder fallen from above washed down by torrent that can not be used by laden animal fancy there be not much communication between valley be governed by chief be only in case of common danger that ever act together prize independence above everything be ready to gather from part of country for common defence european except feel certain have ever entered valley inhabitant be absolutely convinced that ravine pass be impregnable doubt at time other british will be driven to send expedition to convince to contrary think that if there be such thing a gun belief in impregnability must be well justified men be brave hardy thoroughly understand how to take advantage of wonderful facility of ground for defence even in most remote valley have managed to accumulate store of first rate rifle how have got be mystery good many perhaps have be carried off by deserter from frontier regiment many of enlist for purpose alone serve faithfully for time at first opportunity make off with rifle still numerous a desertion be must not account for tithe of rifle in hand of tribesman fancy must be landed by rascally british dealer in persian gulf on coast of beluchistan have be imported by trader from india at rate be unquestionable that vast number of rifle be in hand of afridis will give world of trouble when set in earnest to deprive of wonder government doe forbid exportation of rifle altogether nita said indignantly must be well if did so there be difficulty in way indian prince buy in large quantity for follower nominally be doubt imported for purpose when well up country be taken north disposed of to afridis who be ready to pay price for for afridi value nothing a doe good rifle must willingly exchange wife child to get possession of one nobody want to buy wife child nita said doe seem to that posse sort of property must pay for rifle by time got into country fancy be paid for largely in cattle herd be driven down country watch that can keep can prevent traffic cattle be always consigned to large town well past frontier where rifle can easily be handed over think ought to be stopped altogether nita said indignantly people of town can do very well without afridi cattle if not must be made to must be much better for to have to pay anna extra pound for meat than for to have to spend hundred of life million of pound in getting rifle back again yes there be many thing that soldier who be only here to do fighting can make head tail of if india be governed by soldier instead of civilian thing must be very differently managed a be can only wonder grumble authority be so mightily afraid of injuring susceptibility of native that pamper in way even when be manifest that whole of community suffer by so doing be more ridiculous because in old day own ruler paid not slightest attention to same susceptibility to like dislike of subject be very strange nita said very unaccountable everyone on frontier know that sooner later will have to deal with afridis that will be enormously difficult expensive business will cost immense amount of life let talk about more make out of patience to think of such folly journey be resumed next morning continued day after day week after week sometimes be obliged to turn quite out of direct course have to run considerable risk to get fresh supply for forage for pony be obtained by entering village at night filling sack from stack of grain forage grain pounded between flat stone a sat by fire so made coarse meal generally boiled into sort of porridge sauce pan being gourd cut in field meat have difficulty about a carter managed when necessary to kill bullock take sufficient meat for ten day supply seldom caught sight of villager when travelling through valley for afridis have marked objection to moving about after nightfall once twice one two of approached carter raised loud threatening roar that in case retreated with speed to village filled with alarm with tale of having encountered strange terrible creature gradually difficulty decreased mountain became le precipitous valley larger more thickly inhabited matter caused inconvenience a always traversed at night during journey carter have filled nita note book with sketch map a country be wholly unexplored must be of great advantage to advancing army when properly copied out on large scale be clever with pencil nita used to be greatly interested in lively little sketch of scenery through passed will be very useful to said in event of troop having to march through district must go long way towards securing staff appointment for in such case sketch map must be invaluable must get end of credit for so ought to nita said have taken lot of pain about anyone with map must be able to find way back by route have come have doubt about that said that be if be not with to point out place have passed must find difficult for have come by very devious road of course have have chance whatever of getting compass bearing have only be able to put in by position of sun besides great part of journey have be done by night although of course can indicate general direction of valley through have passed route at night among mountain be necessarily little more than guesswork for except when have moon have practically nothing else to tell of position direction in be going have star nita said yes when get back work out position of star will of course help great deal pole star especially have be of immense use to in fact have not be for star must not except when there be moon have be able to travel be sure will come right when work out nita said confidently that will get immense deal of credit for have be jolly time have in spite of hard work danger know have have capital time of a to health feel a strong a horse fit to walk distance especially since foot have got so hard be time will always look back upon nita a one of most pleasant memory have be splendid comrade thanks to pluck good spirit word can express how much feel indebted to oh be nonsense said of course have done best be very little may not think so in reality owe not only escape various suggestion have be of so much use to a for example hiding in place close to road instead of starting up into hill where must have certainly be overtaken have helped on many occasion too to say nothing of constant cheeriness of companionship have certainly be very strange young man girl thus wandering about together somehow have scarcely felt strange to defence of fort brought very close to other be so far fortunate that prepared for business however agree most thoroughly with that in spite of hardship danger have have to go through companionship have be very pleasant one oh dear nita sighed how disgusting will be to have to put on girl clothes again settle down into being stiff proper fancy having to learn school lesson again after chapter viii darlinger again at length came upon burned village whose wall showed mark of cannon shot shrapnel tower have be blown up valley appeared to be entirely deserted be good sign carter exclaimed work be evidently quite recent doubt be result of punitive expedition sent out to revenge destruction of fort expect from here onwards will find that village have be destroyed of course must still travel cautiously native will doubtless be returning setting about rebuilding home still be not likely to meet many of continuing journey found trace of fire sword everywhere work have be done well thoroughly carter said there be not roof left standing have doubt village on frontier have be visited punished be most serious attack have be made for year on one of border fort may be sure that pain have be spared to make punishment proportionate to offence there will not be many rifle left in part of country for may be sure that will have to be handed in want to run risk if did fall in with native must doubt if after punishment of must dare to meddle with presently indeed did meet party consisting of dozen native be evidently returning to home be armed only with old musket seeing three rifle carried by stranger simply saluted walked on may fairly consider among friend at least among men who no longer venture to be enemy fancy know village be about fifty sixty mile from fort rode out here with troop to demand instant surrender of cattle have be stolen from across frontier country be fairly open way will have difficulty with rest of journey now pressed forward with haste travelling by day towards evening two day later made out far away on plain group of white tent a came nearer saw that considerable number of men be employed in rebuilding house in fort in adding additional work round sun be just setting a arrived at edge of camp evident surprise be caused among soldier at appearance of two officer in khaki uniform be in ribbon so dirty travel stained that be difficult to make out that be officer presently one of soldier recognized carter raised shout immediately soldier flocked round cheering loudly at reappearance of officer who have deemed be killed at capture of fort one noticed nita who seized with new shyness followed carter who must move slowly for soldier pressed forward to salute soon officer appeared on scene too gave lieutenant enthusiastic welcome who be have with one of asked will explain to later on carter said at present want to go to major tent hope be here yes be here poor fellow be quite changed man be frightfully cut up at loss of daughter did find body carter asked innocently no be doubtless among destroyed by fire in mess house thought that be there also for on uncovering ruin found nothing charred mass of body utterly unrecognizable there be major tent be standing at door waiting doubt to ascertain cause of hubbub a carter approached entrance to tent major stepped forward having gathered from shouting who ragged figure approaching be shook lieutenant cordially by hand be glad indeed to find that be alive carter said everyone thought that there be not single survivor of massacre though hear now that havildar one of men be taken prisoner only last week sent off into mountain to offer term for ransom will enter tent if will allow major have something of importance to tell major entered followed by carter with nita three four pace behind major who have not before noticed lieutenant young companion looked at youthful figure in surprise then staggered pace two back a nita holding out hand exclaimed know father with hoarse cry major held out arm nita ran into while carter at once left tent for time major must only murmur exclamation of thankfulness a calmed down at last asked what be doing in masquerade nita explanation be father when place be attacked dressed up in suit of carter clothes because be determined to fight till last be killed rather than be carried away captive did fight father be at last knocked down with butt end of rifle left for dead by next morning recovered consciousness when examined body found that be sensible carter be still insensible be carried off in different direction idea being suppose to obtain ransom for to pacify if must bring expedition into mountain then gave full account of wandering keeping entirely in background giving credit to carter if be carried off by different party how did come together again escaped eventually made way over hill to where have learned that be confined then got away joined have be long time in mountain together travelling time how did get food stole good part of father suppose ought to be ashamed of having done so be absolutely necessary before escaped collected gradually till have sack full then stole pony to carry skin for water supply lasted over fortnight carter went down sometimes into valley killed bullock kept well supplied with meat a to grain occasionally rifled village storehouse so really be never short of food though must say that will be very glad to have piece of good bread between teeth again must not have known in least major said be altered good deal carter be much more so of course have have opportunity of shaving since have be away so have grown quite respectable beard now suppose first thing that must like to do must be to get into own clothes again how be to manage know for of course everything be destroyed at capture of fort must like clothes indeed father of course got quite accustomed to when be prisoner have have time to think about since indeed did not even feel strange in when attack upon fort be going on must not like to be seen wearing man uniform here still suppose few trader have come up have opened temporary store if must go over buy cloth can soon make up something in will not mind appearing think have arrived yet will go across to quarter master tent see what have got major went out in ten minute returned followed by sepoy carrying roll of karkee serge there nita said can make skirt out of with one of jacket will be all right although suppose will be quite fashionably dressed will find needle thread in haversack now dear while be arranging matter will go across to mess room doubt officer be gathered there to hear carter story major returned couple of hour later nita except hair be still short face hand sunburnt be again do know father said a entered feel horribly uncomfortable in clothes of course will get accustomed to in time at present seem to cling about in most disagreeable way must have be pleased dear if have heard hearty cheering there be in mess tent when told who carter companion be for have kept profound silence on subject have simply told that be fellow captive never saw men more pleased show how popular be in regiment carter have told very different tale from what told went of course much more into detail detail related largely to doings first of all gave description of siege of desperate stand made when afridis burst in how fought until last of little group be overpowered then told how when recovered consciousness found carried along how after day travel be imprisoned in upper room of one of fortified house said that found captivity be exceedingly strict that real hope of escape entered breast until one morning found note from fastened to arrow lying on ground told that must shoot in arrow next night with string fastened to rope attached to then went on to tell how when have got down took to camp mile half away where have pony large sack of provision say that during travel showed marvellous amount of pluck endurance that in first skirmish occurred shot two out of three of assailant in consequence became possessed of rifle used to good purpose when be afterwards seriously attacked said that when concluded that large body of tribesman must be at once sent out in search of be advised that must take shelter among rock few yard away from spot where be attacked a be not at likely that enemy must begin search so near to scene of action altogether gave highest credit then be foolish wrong father nita said angrily be sure that will admit that always followed advice without question indeed except in way of travel did go through awfully rough country have continually to change course to avoid impossible difficulty really have adventure to speak of except two skirmish of course be greatly helped by afridi custom of staying indoors after next day nita held sort of reception be called upon by officer of regiment whereas during journey have felt feeling of shyness now felt timid embarrassed a father told feeling must wear off before long few day later major sent nita home to england where at once went to school close to aunt be two year before rejoined regiment found that several change have taken place carter have obtained company have received very high credit for sketch map that have furnished of hitherto unknown country through have passed of course must not be same chum a before be not long before be evident that have not forgotten perilous journey together within month became engaged with father complete approval for carter in addition to captain pay possessed income of year since then have passed through tirah campaign where map proved of great value gained for brevet majority with cherished companion who have become wife life bid fair to be perfectly bright happy one how count conrad von waldensturm took goldstein cheerful home coming johann conrad von waldensturm said bitterly fool be to believe that goldstein must be bound by oath 't be well that have heard news did not learn for first time looking at ruin of home elector of treves must do justice master elector have hand full with quarrel with neighbour must not care to take up arm against powerful vassal must need strong force indeed to take goldstein there be many who although love not baron must not care to war against in quarrel did not greatly concern have be at home think that baron must have dared thus to attack castle without further pretext than family have always be on bad term when emperor called upon honourable gentleman to aid in struggle with turk have thought that harm might come in absence that death must take away father bravest best knight in province that sister minna must be left unprotected have received news earlier of father death might have be home in time if messenger be sent to tell doubt not be case harm befell on way be not until four month later that knight from treves joining army told news then a fortunately defeated turk with heavy loss emperor permitted to return home before left army blow came castle be destroyed most of retainer on estate killed carried away speaker count conrad von waldensturm be young man twenty five year old father castle stood on steep hill above moselle when have left two year before be strong shapely a fair castle a in valley now be ruin stonework be for most part little injured interior have be gutted by fire empty window looked mournfully out on fair prospect gate be gone in several place battlement have be demolished moat be empty drawbridge have disappeared be work of baron wolff von goldstein whose castle lay twelve mile lower down river be much larger stronger place than abode of conrad ancestor for nigh century there have be little friendship between lord of waldensturm of goldstein have taken different side in trouble of time enmity thus created have never died out baron von goldstein have be on winning side have be rewarded by gift of fully land of waldensturm when emperor have called upon noble baron of germany to aid against turk have issued order that feud must during absence be laid aside when allowing son to go to war count von waldensturm have called upon wolff von goldstein to take oath that there must be peace between two family during absence baron have done without hesitation month after count death von goldstein suddenly fell upon castle put retainer to sword ravaged whole of estate carried off minna girl of fourteen to castle other speaker be johann bernkof stout man at arm leader of little troop of eighteen retainer sole survivor of fifty men who have followed young lord to war be sitting on horse twenty yard behind speaker looking in speechless wrath at ruined castle remains of village formerly stood down by river edge untilled field wasted farm what have befallen family none knew father brother friend who have be among retainer of castle have almost certainly perished where woman be sheltered what have become of knew not a count be speaking to bernkof insensibly moved horse up closer young count turned suddenly well men said have be fighting well manfully against enemy of country religion seems to that have enemy at home more faithless more cruel than turk will fight le manfully against will fight to death men shouted drawing sword for home vengeance when time come will call upon young count said though fear that can hing at present be ten time a strong must not hope to storm goldstein first thing be to take care that news that have returned will reach baron therefore scatter to home quietly singly if a fear will generally be case find destroyed take shelter among friend who remain lay aside armour appear a peaceful men find out a far a possible where who have escaped von goldstein attack be sheltered doubt will have gone elsewhere let be sought out told under promise of secrecy have returned bid capable of bearing arm be in readiness to gather on day hour may appoint be at present will take up abode in ruin here who have aught to tell will find there evening in three day let have news where of have bestowed arrange with friend that few lad will come here evening to act a messenger must have need of little troop broke up at once conrad rode with sergeant up to castle dismounting entered courtyard tear came into young count eye a looked round at ruin thought of how father household have bidden farewell how young sister have placed scarf of own embroidering over shoulder have wept freely a did so at thought of month must elapse before must see again for moment unmanned however with effort roused said have not done so much harm a have feared johann stonework have suffered little be carpenter work rather than mason will be needed timber be cheap happily purse be well lined with ransom that turkish emir captured paid for liberty still that matter nothing at present so long a goldstein stand waldensturm will never be rebuilt first thing to do be to look round see where have best bestow ourselves horse there be difficulty in office on ground floor be strongly arched although most of chamber have be crushed in by fall of floor above by battlement have be toppled down upon three four remained intact horse be led into one of young knight johann set to work to clear of debris rubbish for own habitation be better than have hoped former said when work be done now johann must wait for supper till men charged to obtain food for ourselves forage for horse return be accustomed to hard fare matter not so that can obtain bread enough of more than that can not expect for such of vassal a have remained in neighbourhood must be beggared a have not seen head of cattle sheep since crossed border of estate field stood uncultivated two of men presently returned one brought black bread two fowl flask of wine got wine at old richburg lord said have small store escaped plunderer fowl got elsewhere have be out in field when raider came down carl schmidt on return gathered score two have multiplied let run wild so that must raider come again may escape a before have built shelter of sod where house stood will bring two fowl day so long a have left say that to morrow will gather dozen of in maybe will be able to add few egg to fowl brings told that many of people have returned have built shelter in wood others like have established in rough hut on spot where old home stood have sown small patch of grain have be living in hope of return there be not man boy who will not take up arm a soon a give word be glad to hear take thanks to schmidt richburg tell have not come home penniless that whether succeed not against perjured baron will have help to rebuild house to enable to live until can raise crop fire be soon laid for yard be strewn with unburned beam have fallen from roof shed johann plucked split open fowl grilled over fire have done worse than many time when be with emperor conrad said a ate meal when have finished sat for long time in deep thought then remarked must think over plan so far have be able to form none that castle have fallen knew be not aware how absolutely vassal be ruined to morrow morning will mount early ride to point where can have view of goldstein see now that can not hope to gather force must attack castle that if be to succeed must be by well devised trick if have sister out of hand must afford to wait must go round among father friend endeavour to obtain aid from though own have great hope that many must adventure life fortune in quarrel be not own von goldstein be most powerful baron in part stand well with elector of treves if fail to right will go to vienna again lay case before emperor saw before left told what have befallen be greatly angered when heard that von goldstein have broken oath taken advantage of absence to destroy castle active aid must not give gave rescript proclaiming baron to be false perjured knight whose estate be forfeited by treachery called upon elector to deprive of fief to bestow upon declaring that in case of failure to do so must intervene must by force of arm if need be expel von goldstein hand over fief to to be held not under elector directly from must be useless at present for to produce document for elector know well enough that emperor hand be full with war against turk who be trouble at best of time authority be slight over western province elector must write making sort of excuse for not meddling with von goldstein be better before appeal to elector to raise troop from own resource even if laid out penny of emir ransom must scarce gather force must suffice to storm castle feel that if be to recover minna must be by stratagem at present can see way by can be done maybe a look at castle brain may work to more good purpose now johann be well to lead horse out hobble there be field passed way down where grass be growing long thick when boy come to morrow night will arrange with to cut bring in bundle of will stay out there with count must rough rider catch sight of standing unguarded might well take fancy to for yours at least be animal such a be not often seen there be need for johann be dark already be not likely that anyone will pas here after must be well to fetch in at daybreak will do lord arm horse be chief possession now though might replace mine steed a yours must cost noble ransom yes indeed apart from value must not lose since be gift of emperor next morning rode out early entered wood on eminence mile from baron castle then dismounting walked to edge of tree count sat down on fallen tree gazed at castle for hour in silence be indeed strong place castle be perched upon edge of precipitous cliff on three side of fell away almost perpendicularly on other side approach though steep be more gradual in front of castle be large courtyard inside at foot of side wall rose apparently sheer from edge of precipice be quarter of garrison end wall be very strong massive with flanking tower at corner over gateway at foot rock have be cut away perpendicularly forming dry moat twenty foot deep forty wide on other side of moat be similar enclosure open towards castle larger with even more massive wall with strong flanking tower at short distance apart here vassal must drive in cattle herd on approach of hostile force exterior fortification be in unusually strong must have to be taken before second wall must be attacked a must only be approached on face be strong place indeed count said at last must be necessary to scale outer wall even must be done by stealth there must be that deep cut next wall to cross castle be indeed fortress to enter well nigh impossible undertaking think must be necessary to scale wall of outer court lord for there be open ground on side a far a point where cut be made beyond methinks there will be space enough to walk between edge of rock wall castle be most likely so built that cliff go sheer down from foot think be so with wall of courtyard there must be occasion for bravest men must not venture upon narrow ledge where must be overwhelmed by stone missile from wall above think be so johann at rate that cut must have to be passed castle be impregnable save by stratagem treachery within against army with battering machine 't be stronger than thought never took so good look at before for be seldom that rode in direction must need army johann agreed might well cost loss of thousand men must be well content johann young count said gloomily if must carry sister off to ride back with to vienna where emperor must place under protection of dame at court where might carve out new inheritance with sword seems to a difficult to get away a be to storm castle know not where be placed assuredly that knowledge be first that must gain before plan can be contrived must only be done in one of two way by bribing one of servitor at castle by introducing friend of own latter must not be easy count johann said shaking head if baron be apprehensive of attack might increase strength one presenting a man at arm out of employment might be enrolled in band at present be scarcely likely to increase force see that johann must go a minstrel among in castle there might well be who must recognize a know have skill with lute must pas well enough if be not for be detected captured 't be certain must never leave castle alive be not to be thought of count person be so well known to country round that must certainly be recognized if not by baron by of who be with at treves when be there with father before started for war methinks other be only plan baron garrison consists not so much of own vassal a of wandering men at arm whom have gathered round who serve for pay not from duty love among there must be many who must willingly accept bribe if lordship think well of plan will myself go down to village endeavour to gather news be not likely to be known be simple man at arm when went out be only when rudolph max be killed that made officer over rest there have be little communication for year between people of baron to make matter sure might put patch over eye must say be wandering soldier who being disabled in war be now returning unfit to friend at luxembourg will pretend to be very hard of hearing in order that may speak more freely before can even stay there for day two alleging that be wearied worn out 't be certain that baron be not loved by people be hard man rough one go far beyond right in due demand know may learn anything be possible may do so 't be good plan johann must carry out be full young too healthy looking to pas a discharged soldier 't be well that must run risk lord did aught happen to there be not only own life must be lost vassal must have more to hope for so far from what others said last night baron doe not concern with at present be to cultivate land must assuredly gather produce with none to protect speak for must be driven to go elsewhere at rate lord will gladly try naught may come of maybe may hear discontented soldier growling over cup may find opportunity of sounding taking care may be sure not to mention name merely saying that know of manner in handsome sum may be earned by one willing to do service if find rise at bait will bid meet again will before see discus matter with so that may be with judge for how far must be safe to go with at rate johann other plan present at present though think likely that much may come of be at least worth trying rode back to waldensturm hour later johann set out on foot leaving breast back piece behind taking only steel cap be dinted by many blow sword for without weapon of kind one in day must think of travelling be afternoon when entered wine shop in village mile from goldstein chose quiet looking house of better class must be more likely to be frequented by people coming in from country round than by men from castle with black patch over one eye well worn garment looked character well landlady glanced with disfavour at for did not care for custom of wayfarer can pay way said be beggar broken down soldier who have saved little money in war laid crown piece on table have be fighting against turk a see lost eye have almost lost hearing so pray to speak loudly have journeyed far be wearied desire to rest day two before continue journey to luxembourg native town can promise that will give little trouble will talk of later on landlady said know whether can take in if can not will tell where can obtain lodging in village johann made repeat twice time in louder voice then nodded thank mistress know worn out soldier be not welcome customer at house like yours have ever be quiet man given to quarrelling drinking beyond what be seemly only desire quiet house such food a there may be flask of best wine for be long since drank flagon of good moselle a money will last well until get to luxembourg can afford with will take if plea cold meat if have if not cheese fruit landlady seeing that wayfarer be able to pay be likely to give trouble presently placed before food asked for when have finished took seat in corner of room taking jug of wine of have drunk sparingly with landlady paid further attention to till day work be over of neighbour dropped in together with three four person from other village on estate who have be in goldstein on business to sell vintage crop to arrange for carriage by boat to em in hour two left only three four of trader of village who be accustomed to use house a sort of meeting place remained chatted for time on different matter casting occasionally somewhat suspicious glance at johann who be leaning back in chair a if asleep landlady observing said to need not mind be old soldier on way back to luxembourg be very civil spoken man be almost a deaf a post have almost to scream into ear to make understand even if be awake must not hear single word say suppose that have heard that bertha grun lisa hermann will be released from castle in few day gretchen horwitz girl have got to take place hear that bertha be told that lisa other two be to wait on minna von waldensturm during alternate week yes heard other said pass bearing that damsel must be thus taken against will that of parent save for two three old crone there have be woman in castle since baron wife died till minna von waldensturm be taken there after sacking of castle say that baron be determined that will marry son suppose reckons upon young waldensturm being killed in war then can unite waldensturm with goldstein without anyone making objection be sorry for for youth be lout say a savage a brutal a father know that baron ill treatment brought wife to grave must say that son wife must not fare much better be sorry for conrad von waldensturm said spoke well of who knew be gallant youth kindly be likely to prove a good master a father be be bad business fear that there be little chance of ever being righted elector be great friend of baron whose castle in case of trouble must act a bulwark against enemy advancing up river conversation then turned to local matter amount of vintage probability that must turn out unusually good in quality quarter of hour later johann went up to room that landlady have told must occupy next morning after hearty breakfast told that felt so much better after good night rest that must continue journey after paying reckoning left inn returned to waldensturm must have news for johann count said a came in have not expected for two three day have news think of importance related conversation that have overheard struck at once that be very thing that wanted one of young woman who have be carried off against will to act a chamber maiden to countess minna might be induced to befriend who be even more hardly dealt with than be who be beloved by who know escape too must release from further attendance at castle be right johann 't be stroke of good fortune indeed that have learned be of more importance since be evident that time must be lost for if baron have once set mind upon marrying minna to son may at moment force to do so however great repugnance to match must weigh a nothing against determination will myself take matter in hand although might be known be to appear in own dress be not likely anyone must recognize well to do young farmer what might be still better trader travelling with ware a conrad von waldensturm whom suppose to be far away fighting against turk father of girl be evidently substantial men since name be familiar to heard talking there must be difficulty in finding place be probably not very far from goldstein a baron must hardly send to distant farm village for young woman required wish that knew something of men disposition for there be who must put up with outrage of daughter being carried away against will meekly quietly while others must be stirred to greatest anger be so lord a believe that baron be generally hated by vassal think that there be few who must not be glad to do ill turn then be thinking of speaking to not to girl must depend upon father timid man however much might hate count must shrink from allowing daughter to run slightest risk while bold man must heartily enter into scheme be easier to speak to man than to get speech with maiden if when see appears to that must not be likely to consent to daughter taking part in plot must then wait however long for opportunity of addressing one of girl can not go again johann might send henrick who be sharp fellow to goldstein might be dressed a hind giving out that be seeking employment on farm might say that have be told that of two men be likely to give employment might reasonably ask question a to character before going to must be good plan count henrick be lodging in cottage down by river escaped notice of baron men can fetch up in quarter of hour if started at once must be there afternoon fetch by mean johann sergeant have already told soldier nature of work that be required to undertake on arrival at once expressed to conrad willingness to carry out in first place will go to goldstein find out where men live then will go to hamlet nearest to will have difficulty whatever in learning reputation in stand with neighbour character bear may live distance apart be important that must find out about be probable that be well to do men for baron must not have taken daughter of mere boor a attendant on captive must have chosen maiden of good repute manner be not until late next afternoon henrick returned men lived in different direction count said be four mile from goldstein so must only hear about one yesterday evening have to walk to village near where other lived be six mile away next morning be men with considerable holding fact that baron have carried off daughter have excited great indignation among neighbour though of course one dare express sentiment openly least of two men horwitz be said to be man of sullen disposition hard man to who work under very close parsimonious in dealing grun be much more popular among neighbour be kindly man not easily stirred to anger be passionately attached to daughter who be only child since have have to go to castle have not be said left house even to attend to vintage then will try grun first count said man of nature describe will not be likely to betray even must refuse to allow daughter to assist in way have done very well henrick to morrow morning will ride to weisenheim buy for suit of clothes such a small trader who journey through country selling good must wear then go to various shop buy such article a might carry material for dress ribbon kerchief cheap silver ornament make up into pack bring hither buy at one shop even if must have in store that require doing so must excite curiosity get material for at least dozen dress not common good such a be worn on fte day here be money will be amply sufficient for purchase johann will go to morrow morning to village beyond estate buy small horse with saddle such a must be used for packing good on then will be ready for start next morning commission be executed young count started leading pony whose burden be by mean heavy one have learned price henrick have paid for article fastened ticket to a be possible that might be invited in by of country people might ask too much too little for ware so create suspicion that be not what seemed be indeed asked to show good several time a charged rather under price that have given for in town effected several sale about noon arrived at house of farmer grun one of maid who saw coming up ran out 't be use stopping here said in bygone time must have be different master mistress be in deep grief so have heard conrad said yet must fain be allowed entrance having need of speech with master on matter of importance pray to tell so returned in minute master say that visit be untimely that if matter be of importance will see tying up pony to hook in wall conrad followed maid into house big powerful looking man be sitting on chair before empty grate looked up listlessly at conrad entrance hope said young man that have not disturbed in trouble needlessly entered here under false pretext assuredly enter needlessly though own that be under false pretext yet be not so though matter must speak of to be of importance have heard herr grun that be kindly man just in dealing one to be trusted be going to trust farmer listened with increasing surprise a spoke manner of speech be not one that travelling pedlar of good must have adopted be rather that of man of rank be conrad von waldensturm young count went on farmer gave exclamation of surprise rose to foot have just hurried back from war at news that castle have be destroyed estate ravaged sister carried off have come home to rescue heard of outrage of daughter have be victim having made enquiry judge that must not be one to sit down tamely under tamely no man said passionately there be pain of can tiller of soil do against feudal lord show way to avenge count von waldensturm be assured that will not find backward there be not man in barony who must not see castle razed to ground with joy what can do have two hundred armed men within wall must crush a hammer must crush egg have suffered unnumbered wrong at hand at of son who be even worse than how with club stave must attack castle be strongest in electorate have never yet be taken however count have doubtless plan in mind that have thus come to knew honoured father envied who held land under be reported that son must tread in footstep be already beloved by vassal first object conrad said be a may suppose to rescue sister from hand with intention returned home may well believe that news that baron intends to wed to son have added to desire have shown need for haste in carrying out first thing be to ascertain exactly in what part of castle be confined how be guarded manner in chamber must be approached having ascertained must of course open communication with so that may be cognizant of plan be ready to assist in being carried out be not baron doubt son with party of men at arm will set off in pursuit will have ambush prepared have twenty men with good soldier who have fought in war hope to gather fifty more from former vassal must be enough to ensure that none of party who sally out will return alive to castle have a many more determined men might carry castle by surprise for must with own troop ride forward being taken for baron must find gate open drawbridge down entering must hold gate with men until rest who must have followed close behind rushed in when might well overcome garrison taken by surprise a must be 't be good plan farmer said striding up down room methinks that not only can promise aid of daughter can bring score of stout fellow to aid hired ruffian of baron be hated a much a be enter house choose demand victual wine insult woman with foul oath coarse manner lay hand on anything fancy treat a if be conquered people be master be worse than useless to complain of to baron neighbour of mine did so be hung over gate a lesson to rest of of have talked matter over again again a to whether must not be possible to attack baron when rode out with party of men if did so be successful neighbouring lord must unite against a rebel against master whole country must be harried who be caught hung like dog under leading must be different matter must be feud between two noble what must do with castle sir must hold a own conrad said goldstein have destroyed waldensturm waldensturm in turn capture goldstein must appeal to emperor if elector take part against will offer to hold fief of goldstein waldensturm a emperor vassal know that must grant to be elector to besiege castle must lay order on of neighbouring prince hesse luxembourg to give aid then in case count may reckon upon aid of fully hundred men there be not only hate against baron follower prospect of becoming vassal instead of of baron must mean prosperity happiness instead of being ground down by unjust demand exposed to constant insult injury from now lord will call daughter in tell design bid not only to answer question to aid by mean in power bertha be sent for be pretty modest looking girl face told of recent suffering bertha father said be count von waldensturm have returned home from war to rescue sister charge to answer question to aid in way to best of power will readily for young countess have be very kind to pity deeply saved from insult on part of baron son appealed to baron to allow to remain always with not even to descend to kitchen to fetch food baron who evidently wish to humour in small matter gave order be just what must have thought of minna conrad said in tone of deep pleasure now frulein in what part of castle be sister confined in room in north angle be fifty foot from courtyard into look be window barred girl said lower window be strongly guarded on floor be not so then take that if have rope other maiden must easily lower to ground must do easily enough count be there must be nearer escaping there be always guard at gate drawbridge be up at night even when across there be outer court to be passed be there stair to wall near where must alight yes sir there be flight of stair in angle just below window next thing have to think about be safety a sleep in room must be clear that must not have escaped without knowledge assistance baron in fury must be capable of slaying must certainly do so farmer said shortly then be clear that must escape with sister must hide somewhere must be found sooner later girl said not if plan succeeds bertha intend that escape will be known a soon a be completed that baron will set out in pursuit that will have ambush prepared for that will not return to castle with retainer vassal father assistance will then capture in case must be easy enough for to hide girl said there be chamber in castle that none ever enter must without difficulty conceal there must either do escape with young countess will think over conrad said be there sentry on wall there be two on tower over gate none along wall at least two be there in daytime have never looked out at night be only yesterday morning that be released so have five day to think over plan by way must be possible for to descend from room to courtyard at night without passing through occupied room otherwise attracting attention because if so there must be necessity for lowering sister from window think so sir there be staircase by there be communication with floor above that below be small stone winding stair in thickness of wall have never be up down connects with room by short passage in there be door be always kept closed at night lock young countess obtained key from baron saying that did not have anyone ascending descending must come into room without let hindrance there can be little doubt that stair descend to courtyard that be used by men going up down to sentry duty on upper platform only question be whether door at foot opening into courtyard be kept locked can not say sir never went down to courtyard when be at castle be there sentry posted on top of tower yes sir believe so at rate often hear tread of men going up down that by night a well a by day in case be possible that door be not kept locked a be so often used must give unnecessary trouble if key have to be fetched time sentry be changed be very important that must know for certain because must save much risk trouble if must leave keep without descending from window see how must let know like putting adventure off until be again on duty for there be saying when baron may carry out intention of forcing sister to become son wife must manage count farmer said might well enough go to castle with present of fruit with woman gear that bertha might have left behind might not be able to see girl might send down message if door be locked need send only thanks if be open must say that need not trouble to send fruit a have abundance of everything wanted must be very good plan young count said will return here in three day by time hope to have plan laid out on return to waldensturm conrad ordered two three of men to make light ladder twenty five foot long sent henrick over to weisenheim to buy hundred yard of light very strong cord next night rode with johann to within short distance of goldstein latter carrying ladder be dark night leaving horse mile from castle made way towards reached foot of outer wall taking great care to avoid making noise proceeded along edge of wall of outer court until came to cut in rock then ladder be lowered down descended shifting ladder to other side be soon at foot of wall of inner court found to satisfaction that there be two foot of level ground between edge of precipice a went on sometimes widened to twenty foot more sometimes narrowed to three foot a wall kept straight along without following irregularity of rock at masonry rose up in front of extending to very edge of crag knew that have reached castle that sixty foot above be chamber in minna be confined so far everything be well johann if only door at bottom of flight of step be unbolted seems to that will have difficulty everything have succeeded beyond expectation three day ago rescue of sister seemed almost impossible now thanks to bertha grun father everything be in train returning a came carried ladder to wood where have left horse hiding there rode home boy have not be idle day have gone out sometimes to place many mile away to warn vassal young lord have returned that must hold in readiness to assemble at waldensturm with best arm must obtain immediately upon receiving summons tenant be all delighted when heard message boy have carried with money to give to who be in want to purchase long pike sword in readiness for service lord might require of day after expedition to goldstein conrad resumed trader dress taking pack pony a before went to grun matter will be easier than expected said to farmer who gave hearty greeting have found that once at foot of castle there be difficulty in making one way along if daughter find that door at bottom of staircase be unlocked there be difficulty then described how made way along to foot of wall of castle a can be few pace from bottom of staircase to one in angle must if in dark clothes mount wall unperceived even be there guard in courtyard be most unlikely a baron have fear whatever of attack be only upon outer wall that shrewd watch must be kept think that to avoid danger must be better that daughter companion must also fly when once beyond wall must have guide in readiness to take to one of cottage still standing on estate in pack be long rope well knotted be not bulky daughter must wind round under garment when get on to wall will fasten one end securely drop other down will be there will at once climb to top lower sister girl down one by

anything yes have sounded many of neighbour one will gladly join in attempt to overthrow baron son of will communicate with others have not mentioned name given particular have simply said that there be plot on foot be in opinion certain to be successful in manner will prevent of neighbouring lord taking up baron cause have reason to believe that new lord who will be just good master will be forthcoming think can promise by middle of next week there will be hundred fifty men ready for work must be ample grun if be successful promise that farm will be for ever exempt from feudal obligation rent quittance will not come over again until daughter have returned to castle have learned from whether door be open if be not so must examine bolt carefully be probable that must be shot from inside if have suitable tool in case must defer until again return to castle unless companion find that can get bolt back without difficulty ask to ascertain first day return have thought that possibly might not be able to see that message that sends down to might not be rightly reported therefore instead of paying visit tell on morning after return to castle be to go to window between eight nine o'clock to shake cloth garment out of if door be unlocked find that can open will be watching for signal if be not made attempt will be deferred if be made will be at midnight on third night after return at

bring ax so that can fell tree across road behind so enclose be of utmost importance that not one will escape to carry news to castle bertha be called in instruction be repeated to until conrad be perfectly satisfied that knew what have to do be at once to inform minna that brother have returned be prepared to rescue tell directly get back bertha then if baron must determine to hurry on marriage can beg for week further grace before take place everything being now arranged conrad returned home waited impatiently for hour when signal must be made on morning three of men dressed a peasant took up position at various point quarter of mile so from castle hiding behind bush so that must not be perceived from castle soon after eight o'clock watcher saw figure come to window shake garment a if to free from dust then one by one got up strolled carelessly away mounted horse in wood rode back to waldensturm men number of boy be assembled at ruin be at once sent off to order vassal

tightened a soon a have passed so a to trip over of rearmost horseman who tried to escape tree be cut almost through at point men with ax stationed there so a to bring down a soon a horseman have passed having seen that everything be in readiness conrad left johann in command with three of follower rode on to edge of wood nearest castle here two of men remained with horse when heard conrad horn sound be to bring up towards castle to stop just beyond bowshot henrick carrying ladder accompanied a before have difficulty in gaining foot of castle wall after waiting quarter of hour there be

have followed conrad called off knew that stair must not be carried without great loss a dozen men at top of of flight of step must hold against hundred fight have not be conducted in darkness for there be many torch burning in courtyard will wait till morning said be like rat in trap at moment sudden uproar be heard in inner courtyard shout of waldensturm waldensturm couple of minute later johann party rushed in through upper gate where stopped astonished at quietness prevailed be on wall johann there be nothing more to do at present conrad said will go back with will take possession of castle there be not likely to be resistance few men will have remained there when see that courtyard be in hand will hardly resist if surrender will kill one damage must be done to anything castle be mine now herr grun will remain in command here think men on wall will make attack keep close watch on castle gate be closed when reached five six men with cross bow be at window commanding what ho there conrad said be useless for to resist conrad von waldensturm call upon to surrender baron son be killed garrison rest be in power if surrender peacefully life will be spared if not man will be put to sword there be short pause then voice said surrender relying upon knightly word minute later sound of bar being withdrawn be heard door opened conrad with own follower entered letting others remain without men be first disarmed placed in guard chamber at gate sentry posted outside then taking torch from wall conrad made hasty survey of interior telling frightened scullion other servant that harm must come to 't be indeed stately castle said to johann have made good exchange now do remain here in charge will go down see how matter be proceeding day be breaking already then with who have remained outside castle gate joined main body in outer courtyard now grun said to farmer will summon men on wall to surrender must see that case be desperate there be sixty seventy of be hopelessly outnumbered if refuse will not attack hunger thirst will soon tame have not lost life must not that of good fellow mine must be killed be to storm wall must assuredly lose many must be sorry indeed be wife left widow child fatherless by night work accordingly a soon a became light conrad summoned men on wall to surrender on promise of life being spared answer be yell of defiance when subsided said well if plea to starve like rat in trap can do so there be hope of escape of aid arriving baron son party who rode with be dead castle be in possession be a much prisoner a if be in dungeon now ordered own men dozen of vassal to leave courtyard form line across narrow neck by castle be approached to see that one passed for deemed possible that man might be lowered from wall to entreat aid from of baron neighbour food be brought out from castle distributed men be divided into four party of be to take up station near foot of four flight of step up to wall two mounted men be sent off to waldensturm to fetch young countess back courtyard be cleared of body have fallen three hour later minna arrived on way have heard detail of capture of castle be delighted to hear that have be taken without loss of single man be proud of indeed minna said always be so after capturing in way castle that baron considered impregnable will always regard a hero indeed credit be chiefly due to grun daughter conrad said without must have done nothing with aid matter be simple enough brother sister sat for long time talking together in great hall of castle have much to tell other of what have happened since have parted two year before be really to be lord of castle said can keep conrad elector may bring army against think can hold if doe think that will have order from emperor to elector to declare baron estate forfeited to install in place contains threat that must send force to carry out if failed to do so must hold direct from have not captured castle parchment must have be of little good elector must know that threat be vain one since emperor have force that must send on long expedition needing man in struggle with turk moreover elector regarded baron a great friend of even did feel constrained by command of emperor to aid must know that must need force that must raise to capture castle now that have be done be master matter have changed altogether must rather have a friend than enemy especially a most of vassal that must call upon to aid in recapturing castle must have viewed with displeasure baron attack on hold in absence after having taken oath of peace have fear whatever of that large portion of vassal of estate have aided must take refuge here if force marched against must fight till last knowing that mercy must be shown to minna think that need have fear for future at four o'clock in afternoon conrad be summoned to courtyard a men on wall have shouted that be ready to surrender thought that must soon be tired of being cooped up there without food drink conrad said a went out have be expecting for last two three hour thirst rather than hunger have done work certainty sooner later must give in have broken spirit a count appeared in courtyard there be general shout of surrender on promise of life promise that now let man take off armour lay arm on wall then come down four at time will have food water given to will then leave castle anyone found within limit of estate by nightfall will receive mercy in hour last of garrison have left castle tenant on estate at once dispersed to home receiving present from count promise of remission of half that year due own vassal kept there to form with retainer garrison until must hire sufficient force for purpose at end of time must return to ruined home conrad promising aid to rebuild house entire remission of due for next two year conrad then drew up document addressed to elector stating what have done enclosing copy of emperor order saying that must present original when visited court of treves a have anticipated elector reply be favourable have be said shocked at conduct of baron in attacking ravaging castle estate of waldensturm punishment inflicted upon be just one must therefore willingly accept conrad a vassal for feoff of goldstein begged to speedily repair to court to take oath thus conrad von waldensturm revenged wrong obtained finest estate strongest castle in electorate of treves raid by black story of outlying station begin to think be wrong in coming so far out into bush be tempted by what hawkins told of place have come across when exploring country seemed everything must be desired plenty of water timber for purpose fine grazing admit that be that said black be quiet enough then though be good bit beyond nearest station thought when came have look at place that be well worth risking have not done badly here sheep cattle have pretty well doubled number year wool have paid expense everything have be comfortable enough except difficulty have have in bringing up grocery flour in ten year if have gone well must have be really prosperous man with big flock of sheep fine herd of cattle to say nothing of horse now black have got nasty begin to think have made great mistake have heard more bad news william wife asked anxiously yes harry read rode up hour ago said that brother be going to drive animal in take to station of friend of forty mile nearer sydney till thing settled down bit for have heard that two three station have be attacked by black soul murdered what do think wife will do same mr robert be courageous woman know what to say replied be getting on very well here a said of course always knew that there be risk must not have got big station like down country without paying large sum for far more than must have afforded think must be pity to give up at present after may not be attacked see have three men now only have one when came here built house specially for defence with squared log even log for roof so that must not be set on fire must get shingle off in hour a be dry season think must be a well to do at once can shoot fairly well so can effie with six rifle ought to be able to keep off mob of native how about animal husband said well must say that best plan must be to send greater part of away for bit talbot have nothing like enough stock on place have doubt must be glad to graze for bit at very small rent of course if think best be quite ready to give place up though in opinion must be pity after chance of black coming here be not great there be dozen of other station a exposed a be have have two three alarm before nothing have ever come of be glad that be opinion wife mine be exactly same certainly for own sake must great deal rather stay here take chance be of effie be thinking well then will consider settled will ride down to talbot at once arrange with will get back late evening to morrow morning will take lot of stock over there thompson will go with to help to drive down will bring back a be a well to keep a strong garrison here a possible can arrange with talbot that one of men will be specially told off to look after animal will pick out three hundred of best ewe few ram hundred cattle dozen of best horse need not take more horse than that be shy of blackfellow there be not much fear of being caught so need not bother about especially a if be taken away to new ground

really black animal will have chance of escaping be pitch dark even if there be of in yard be not likely to see two minute later door be very cautiously opened four men went out effie barred behind then joined mother who have hastily dressed took gun went to effie window be already open will not be able to see where to fire mother dear if black do attack will hear by yelling whereabouts be can fire in direction may not hit of will confuse alarm however remember when hear stir first thing for to do be to run down to door in readiness to open when father men return sheep be moving about now be quiet before mother be likely black will begin there mr robert said doubt be hungry be always sheep that make for first will very likely kill have feast before attacking trust however that may not attack at must know that house be strong one may not care to risk life have only come to drive off stock still be afraid will try attack hoping may be asleep that may gain entrance before have time to get rifle four five minute later low whistle be heard outside effie ran down opened door when father men at once entered door be bolted behind well mr robert said fear there be doubt that there be black about from uneasiness of animal must say there be good number of however be warned think that surprise will be on side not on ours removed bar so animal can get away if like also have locked door of stable except for uneasiness of animal saw sign of enemy at now first thing to do be to get shutter closed be at once done mr robert have always be little nervous of trouble with black so in addition to building house of solid log have have strong loopholed shutter arranged on window of lower story when closed be held in position by massive cross bar discussed best position for to take in case of attack having arranged one of men went up to keep look out from upper window while rest of party remained chatting in sitting room wish there be moon mr robert said be so dark that will be firing quite at random must not make sort of torch effie suggested must light up place outside be first rate idea effie how be to manage party sat silent for minute then effie said there be plenty of wool how must be to make bundle of about a big a head wind round with wire then soak in paraffin when native come have only to put match to throw outside very good indeed effie father said let try to carry out idea at once a material be to hand will not take long in hour six of ball be finished have short length of wire by must be thrown through window fortunately there be plenty of paraffin bucket being filled with ball be soaked one after be then carried upstairs in separate basin will have to be very careful how throw mr robert said else will be setting on fire thompson be think worst shot of lot a be rather short sighted will therefore trust business to have old blanket ready to beat out of burning oil may drop on floor be careful also to keep a much in shelter a possible of black be sure to have bow ready right bos need not fear will look out now a be to be on duty upstairs might a well go up at once send james down think bos have better take post at loophole now may catch sight of one of varmint against sky line will throw ball a soon a hear first shot be quiet for quarter of hour then effie suddenly fired shot be followed by wild yell outside dozen of dark figure leaped to foot bounded towards door strove to break in with waddies ax defender be hard at work occasional yell of pain showed that bullet be taking effect suddenly there be even wilder yell a brilliant ball of fire fell twenty yard from house lighting up front of almost a if be day shot told now in minute native fled with wild bound outside circle of light losing heavily before vanished into darkness well think will try game again mr robert said when firing ceased after shaking hand wildly round sat down did not expect to attack so boldly be quite contrary to usual habit if have not be for fire ball know how thing must have gone be splendid idea effie why ought to set up a inventor there be further attack two hour later one of men on watch thought heard movement in neighbourhood of spring on firing shot in direction be quiet there be further disturbance till day broke soon after daylight party except man on watch sat down to breakfast discussed event of night what do think will do next father effie asked know whether will hunt down cattle horse drive off whether will hang round here for time be difficult to say at rate think have cause for uneasiness except so far a touch one pocket be lucky indeed that shifted more than animal to talbot henceforth must divide into two party keep watch by turn for have provision enough to last for couple of month have only one chance be to set place on fire that practically did away with when took shingle off roof must never venture to bring stick fire up to door in teeth of rifle two hour passed quietly then loud yell be heard number of speck of fire shot through air blazing arrow settler said quietly expect have white man among escaped convict of course have put up to fancy use fire arrow though of course may do so well can amuse a long a like may go on for four twenty hour will never set beam on fire for ten minute flight of arrow continued below must hear constant tapping a missile struck roof at end of time ceased to fall native evidently recognizing that for reason other attempt be complete failure made more effort small group of must be seen out on plain in pursuit of animal however be evidently alarmed by shout proceeding of night before made off at top of speed whenever native approached horse be especially wild kept considerable distance away will take good many day to gather in mr robert said grimly fortunately horse mine effie be safe in shed a fastened door be commanded by loophole in shutter on side of house a long a hold out will be safe a soon a rascal have gone off will ride into settlement get dozen men to help then will set off in pursuit must think that by to morrow at latest be likely to give up a bad job must know that have chance of starving out black however evinced intention of leaving must be seen moving about among tree by smoke rose in direction be evident that have kindled large fire be so far within bush that exact position must not be made out shot be fired from time to time when black showed be done rather for purpose of showing that besieged be on watch than with hope of hitting quickly moving figure main body of sheep be huddled out on plain mile away under charge of two of black leaving mr robert effie on watch rest of party now went out dragged body of native who have be killed distance from house covered with thick layer of earth two three of sheep have be killed by chance shot be carried in skinned hung up will be ample to last colonist said will be off long before be eaten evening be likely will be making great feast expect to morrow morning will be off to carry out fresh rascality elsewhere if thought intended to stop here longer must try to get through to night to fetch help must do bos in case one of men said be just what be thinking will try to do warrant will be a thick a pea round place to night next morning however be seen that black have intention of moving at present party of two three be starting across plain evidently with intention of driving in of cattle can not make out one of men said rather anxiously ca think what game can be a rule strike blow have big feast then be off at once driving sheep

under lower bar kept straight on have comfort of knowing that be not for slight sound black must be listening for opening of door of house stable crawled for good quarter of mile before felt assured that be well beyond cordon of native then stood up put whistle always carried to lip blew twice sharply loudly in stillness of night must instantly hear sound of horse foot then there be burst of yell shout continued rapid tramp of hoof kept on whistled again minute later horse dashed up to sprang on back with word of encouragement patted on neck then set off at full speed hundred yard behind black be running a hard a must filling air with shout felt that be safe now strong steady pace showed that horse must not have sustained serious injury indeed be case so swiftly be distant whistle followed by approach of galloping horse that black have scarce time to take up spear waddies when animal dashed through scattering in path like chaff before spear have be thrown be aimed high at rider who believed be in saddle only one have slightly grazed animal back girl took circuit lest of black must be on road knowing foot of country regained track two mile farther on at time have eased down to
