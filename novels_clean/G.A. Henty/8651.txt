be packed up that be to be left behind being handed over to care of barrack master considerable portion of heavy baggage sent on by cart there be delay officer men be alike delighted that period of waiting have come to end there be loud cheering in barrack yard a soon a news came at daybreak next morning rest of baggage started under guard three hour later mayo fusilier marched through town with band playing at head amid cheer of populace a yet martial spirit be roused by struggle in peninsula have scarcely begun to show there be strong animosity to france throughout england desire to aid people of spain portugal in effort for freedom in ireland for most part there be such feeling since battle of boyne siege of limerick france have be regarded by greater portion of peasantry section of population of town a natural ally of ireland there be hope that when napoleon have europe prostrate under foot must come a deliverer of ireland from english yoke consequently although townspeople of athlone cheered regiment a marched away country people held aloof from a passed along road scowling look from woman greeted in village while men ostentatiously continued work in field without turning to cast glance at terence be not posted to father company be in of captain o'driscol although lad must have preferred to be with captain o'grady with whom be great favourite latter be one of captain whose company be unprovided with ensign have asked adjutant to let have lad instead of ensign who be to join at cork matter have be settled other way o'grady in colonel opinion will be much better with o'driscol who be more likely to keep in order than be o'grady be one of most original character in regiment be rather under middle height have smooth face guileless innocent expression habit of opening light blue eye a in wonder hair be short stuck up aggressively brogue be strongest in regiment blunder be innumerable look of amazement at laughter called forth be admirably feigned save that twinkle of eye induced suspicion that enjoyed joke a well a anyone good humour be imperturbable be immensely popular among men officer o'driscol repeated in mild astonishment do mean to say that o'driscol will keep in better order than if there be one man in regiment more than who must get on well with lad be meself barring none must get on well enough with o'grady have doubt must be by letting have own way in encouraging in mischief of kind o'grady eyebrow be elevated eye expressed hopeless bewilderment be wrong entirely cleary nature intended for schoolmaster be just accident have taken to soldiering flatter meself that one look after subaltern more sharply than do only fear be that be too severe with may be mild in manner know well enough to tremble if speak sternly to trembling must be with amusement adjutant grumbled well colonel have settled matter terence will be in order to morrow a appointed to o'driscol company other to yours thank for nothing cleary o'grady said with dignity must have seen that under tuition lad must have turned out one of smartest officer in regiment have heard of spartan way of teaching son to avoid drunkenness captain o'grady divil word cleary reckon that best way with haythens be to keep from touching whisky be what always recommend to men of company when come across one of worse for liquor adjutant laughed be not spartan way o'grady advice if taken must doubtless have same effect who be spartan at have not time to tell now o'grady have end of business on hand thin what do keep talking here for have lot of work on hand too came in to ask simple question instead of giving civil answer kape wasting time wid o'driscols spartan kind of rigmarole be worst of being in irish regiment nothing can be done widout ever so much

parsonstown templemore tipperary fermoy a colonel have received order to use speed at place portion of regiment be accommodated in barrack while rest be quartered in town late in evening of fifth day march arrived at cork next day went on board two transport provided for joined fleet assembled in cove of ship have be lying there for nearly month waiting order troop on board be heartily weary of confinement news however that sir arthur wellesley have be at last appointed to command that be to sail for portugal have caused great delight for have be feared that might like other body of troop be shipped off to distant spot only to remain there for month then to be brought home again nothing indeed must exceed vacillation confusion reigned in english cabinet at time force of england be frittered away in small objectless expedition plan of action be changed with report sent either by interested leader of insurrectionary movement in spain by signally incompetent men who have be sent out to represent england who distributed broadcast british money british arm to most unworthy applicant by lavishness subservience to spaniard representative increased natural arrogance of people caused to regard england a power be honoured by being permitted to share in spanish effort against french general general spencer with men be kept for month sailing up down coast of spain portugal receiving contradictory order from home endeavouring in vain to co operate with spanish general of whom have own private purpose be bent on gratifying personal ambition of thwarting scheme of rival rather than on opposing common enemy not only be english ministry incapable of devising plan of action be constantly changing naval military officer of force at one moment one general admiral seemed to posse confidence while soon afterwards without slightest reason two three others with greater political influence be placed over head when at last sir arthur wellesley whose service in india marked a greatest soldier be sent out with supreme military power gave definite plan of action general spencer be nominally placed under order by one set of instruction while authorized to commence operation in south without reference to sir arthur wellesley admiral purvis who be junior to admiral collingwood be authorized to control operation of sir arthur while wellesley have scarcely sailed when sir hew dalrymple be appointed to chief command of force sir harry burrard be appointed second in command sir arthur wellesley be reduced to fourth rank in army that have be sent out to command two of men placed above being almost unknown never having commanded military force in field men assembled in cove of cork knew nothing of thing be going out under command of victor of assaye to measure strength against of french have fear of result hope captain o'grady said a officer of wing of regiment to belonged sat down to dinner for first time on board transport that will not have to keep together in going out why so o'grady captain asked because there be doubt at ship be fastest in fleet that will get there in time to have little brush with french to ourselves before others arrive what make think that be fastest ship here o'grady anyone can see with eye o'driscol look at line be flyer if be not obliged to keep with others will be out of sight of rest of before have sailed six hour pretend to know anything about line o'grady look to regular old tub be old o'grady admitted reluctantly give plenty of wind will see how can walk along there be laugh round table o'grady absolute confidence in anything in be interested be known to horse have be notoriously most worthless animal in regiment although continually last in hunting field o'grady opinion of speed be never shaken there be always excuse ready horse have be badly shod be out of sort have not have feed before starting going be heavy did not like heavy ground country be too hilly too flat for be same with company with non commissioned officer with soldier servant notoriously drunken rascal with quarter o'grady looked round in mild expostulation at laugh will see said confidently there can be mistake about two day later ship of war entered harbour usual salute be exchanged then signal be run up to one of mast head again gun of fort pealed out salute word ran through transport sir arthur wellesley be on board on following day fleet got under way transport being escorted by line of battle ship four frigate be to join lord collingwood squadron a soon a have seen charge safe into tagus before evening sea horse be mile astern of rearmost ship of convoy one of frigate sailing back fired gun a signal to to close up well o'grady have left fleet see though not in way predicted whist man see that captain be out of temper because have got to keep together instead of letting go ahead rag of sail be now piled on to ship a many of others be showing nothing above topgallant sail rejoined rest just a darkness fell there see o'grady said triumphantly look what can do when like do see o'grady with twice a much sail up a anything else have in three hour picked up mile have lost wait until get wind hope sha' get anything of sort at least strong wind old tub must open seam if did might think lucky if got through at o'grady smiled pleasantly said be useless to argue with so obstinate man be afraid o'grady be wrong a usual dick ryan said to terence who be sitting next to when once have taken idea into head nothing will persuade that be wrong there be doubt sea horse be a slow a can be suppose owner have interest with government must surely never have taken up such old tub a troop ship chapter ii two danger next day in spite of sail carried sea horse lagged behind one of frigate sailed back to captain shouted angry order to master to keep place in convoy if get wind o'grady said a frigate bore up on course again will take time to keep up with fine fellow see explained to terence vessel be perfect in point like good deal of wind be best in calm now ship want wind think doe captain o'grady terence replied gravely at rate strong point be not sailing in light wind o'grady admitted regretfully be not ship fault have doubt at that bottom be foul that have lot of barnacle weed twice a long a body be reason why be little sluggish may be terence agreed must have thought that must have seen to before sent to cork be like enough that owner be well wishers of napoleon terence that be out of spite that have done there be doubt that be wonderful craft be quite inclined to agree with captain o'grady for a have never seen ship except when regiment came back from india ten year ago be judge of one be eye terence ca say have be much at sea except on voyage out home have eye for ship can see good point at glance can take from that be wonderful vessel must look better if sail be bit cleaner not so patched terence said looking up might look better to eye lad doubt owner know what be doing consider that go better with sail fit than must with new one terence burst into roar of laughter o'grady a usual looked at in mild surprise what be laughing at young spalpeen be thinking captain o'grady lad said recovering that be great pity must not have obtained situation of devil advocate have read that year ago someone be appointed to defend old nick when others be pitching into to show that be not a black a be painted be respectable gentleman who have be maligned by world doubt there be good deal to be said for o'grady said seriously give dog bad name know may hang have doubt old one have be held responsible for lot of thing never have a much a tip of finger in at at seeing that captain be about to pursue matter much further terence making excuse that be time went down to see if men breakfast be right slipped off dick ryan have hearty laugh over o'grady peculiarity think o'grady captain o'driscol said two day later be going to have opportunity for unless be mistaken there be going to be change of weather cloud banking up ahead look like gale from southwest before night wind be blowing furiously sea horse taking green sea over bow wallowing gunwale under in wave at daylight when went on deck gray mass of cloud be hurrying overhead angry sea alone met eye not sail be in sight whole convoy have vanished be out of sight of fleet o'grady captain o'driscol said grimly felt sure must be o'grady said triumphantly sorra one of must keep foot with be ahead of man o'driscol said angrily mile mile ahead ahead be must know better though be little enough know of ship see be close hauled there be doubt that be vessel strong point why have dropped rest of like hot potato if little breeze keep on maybe will be in tagus day day before o'driscol be too exasperated to argue o'driscol be good fellow o'grady said turning to terence be misfortune that be so prejudiced now what be own opinion have opinion about captain o'grady have very strong opinion that be not going to enjoy breakfast that motion doe not agree with at have be ill night dick ryan be awfully bad by sound heard must say good many of others be same way on main deck be awful have got hatch battened down just took peep in bolted for seemed to that everyone be ill best plan lad be to make up mind that be quite well if once do that will be right directly terence must not for moment reply having made sudden rush to side see how can persuade that be quite well said when returned when feel terribly ill yes want resolution terence be afraid that be deficient in must not be half half have got to say to yourself 'this be glorious never enjoyed so well in life when have said that feel that be quite true whole thing will be over doubt in least terence said ca say without telling prodigious lie worse still must not believe lie when have told then be afraid that must submit to be ill terence know once that have drame drame be be at sea horribly sea sick woke up said to myself be nonsense be a well a ever be faith so be ill a terence be burst into fit of laughter be just dream captain o'grady mine be reality know think that be looking quite well be perfectly well a far a sea go terence never be better in life that pork have for dinner yesterday be worse than usual think perhaps ought to have taken glass two to correct must have be pork terence said a seriously a o'grady be unfortunate that be such abstemious man a say effect might have be corrected be opinion terence boy that be humbug then captain o'grady be clear that evil communication must have corrupted good manner must have be in infancy then terence for divil bit of manner good bad have ever seen in have not even good manner to take glass of cratur when be asked that be true enough terence laughed having be brought up in regiment have learned at least that best thing to do with whisky be to leave alone be afraid will never be credit to terence not in way of being able to make heavy night of then turn out a fresh a paint in morning terence retorted see captain o'grady even abstinence have advantage for at least there will always be one officer in corp able to go round of sentry at night at moment vessel gave heavy lurch that be thrown off foot rolled into lee scupper while at same moment rush of water swept over amidst shout of laughter from other officer two scrambled to foot illustration two french privateer bear down upon sea horse holy moses o'grady exclaimed be drowned entirely sha' get taste of salt water out of mouth for week there be one comfort terence said might have be worse how must have be worse o'grady asked angrily why if have be in steadiest ship in whole fleet might have be washed overboard there be shout of laughter o'grady made dash at terence latter easily avoided went down below to change clothes gale increased in strength whole vessel strained so heavily that seam began to open by one o'clock captain requested major harrison who be in command to put of soldier at pump for three day night relay of men kept pump going have not be for troop on board sea horse must long before have gone to bottom with such powerful aid water be kept under on morning of fourth day storm began to abate by evening more canvas be got on next morning two vessel be seen astern at distance of four five mile after examining through glass captain sent down message to major harrison asking to come up in three four minute officer appeared there be two strange craft over there major from appearance have not least doubt that be french privateer thought must like advice a to what have best be done know see gun might just a well be thrown overboard for good must be major said thing must not be safe to fire salute with blank cartridge can hardly be called serviceable master agreed spoke to owner about said that a be going to sail with convoy did not matter that must have others for next voyage must like to see owner dangling from yardarm major said wrathfully however just at present question be what have best be done of course must not take ship from must have very little difficulty in sinking first thing be to put on stitch of sail must avail nothing can sail two foot to one quite so major must not hope to get away must think be trying to do so idea be that must press on a fast a can till open fire at must hold on for bit then haul up into wind lower top sail will take for proof of surrender wo strike flag captain can not do anything treacherous be not thinking of doing that see flag be not hoisted yet wo hoist at till get close alongside then can haul up sweep deck with musketry of course men will keep below until last moment plan will do very well major agreed be if venture to come boldly alongside one be pretty sure to do so though other may lay ahead astern of with gun pointed to rake in case make resistance seeing what be that carry only four small gun side be hardly likely to suspect anything wrong be not at afraid of beating off only fear be that after have sheared away will open upon from distance yes must be awkward however if do must keep men below in meantime have better get carpenter to cut up spar make lot of plug in readiness to stop up hole make near water line think be likely to make very ragged hole wood be so rotten shot must go through side a if be brown paper still might get lot of square of canvas ready with hammer nail strange craft be already heading towards sea horse time be lost in setting stitch of canvas that must carry wind be light now vessel be rolling heavily in long swell major examined gun closely found that be even worse than have anticipated rust hole eaten in iron having be filled up with putty whole painted be turning away with exclamation of disgust when terence who be standing near said to beg pardon major think that if be to wind thin rope very tightly round three four inch thick might stand charge two of grape to give at close quarter need put in very heavy charge of powder even if did burst must think that rope must prevent splinter from flying about idea be not bad one at terence will see if captain have got coil two of thin rope on board fortunately ship be fairly well supplied in respect few of sailor who be accustomed to serving rope with dozen soldier to help be told off to work rope be wound round a tightly a strength of dozen men must pull process being repeated five six time until gun be surrounded by a many layer of rope thin rod have be inserted in touch hole cannon be then loaded with usual charge of powder filled to muzzle with bullet rod be then drawn out powder poured in until reached surface while be being done soldier not engaged in work went below officer sat down under shelter of bulwark two privateer large lugger brig have be coming up rapidly by time gun be ready for action be mile away presently puff of smoke burst out from bow of lugger round shot struck water short distance ahead of sea horse held on course without taking notice of for few minute privateer be silent then when be mile away brig opened fire two three shot hulled vessel will do captain major said may a well lay to now sea horse rapidly flew up into wind sheet be thrown off upper sail be lowered one after other job being executed slowly a if by weak crew two privateer have be sailing within short distance of other now

moment covered with dead dying men minute later volley fired by remaining company completed work of destruction halliard of one of lugger sail have be cut by grape sail now came down with run to deck down below of major shouted fellow behind will rake in minute soldier ran down to hold again minute later brig sailing across stern poured in fire of gun one by one standing much lower in water than opponent none of shot traversed deck of sea horse carried destruction among cabin fitting of deck below a however be entirely deserted one be injured by shot flying fragment brig then took up position three four hundred yard away on quarter of sea horse opened steady fire against to barque must make reply fire of musket being wholly ineffective at distance lugger lay helpless alongside sea horse survivor of crew have run below dared not return on deck to work gun a must have be swept by musketry of sea horse hour later terence be ordered to go below to see how be getting on in hold terence did so lantern have be lighted there found that four men have be killed dozen so wounded by enemy shot greater portion of however have gone over head carpenter assisted by of non commissioned officer be busy plugging hole have be made in between wind water have fairly succeeded a four five shot have struck so low enemy object being not to sink to capture vessel a passed up through main deck to report terence saw that destruction here be great indeed woodwork of cabin have be knocked into fragment there be great gaping hole in stern seemed to that before long vessel must be knocked to piece returned to deck reported state of thing look bad major said to o'driscol be hour work when fellow come to conclusion that can not make strike will aim lower there will be nothing to do to choose between sinking hauling down flag after delivering report terence went to side of ship looked down on lugger attraction of ship have drawn closer to be few foot away thought struck went to o'grady look here o'grady said that fellow will smash up altogether if do something must be bright boy to see terence faith have be thinking so for last ten minute what be to do musket wo carry so far at least not to do good cannon be next to useless two of lot fired though rope prevented damage being done quite so there be plenty of gun alongside now if go to major volunteer to take company gain possession of lugger with one of mate dozen sailor to work can get up main sail engage brig by power terence be broth of boy hurried away to major major said if will give leave will have up company take possession of lugger will want one of ship officer dozen men to work sail then will go out give brig pepper be splendid idea o'grady be not idea at at be terence o'connor who suggested to suppose can take lad with by mean get company up at once o'grady hurried away in minute men of company poured up onto deck can come with terence have major leave said to lad at moment there be slight shock a lugger came in contact with ship come on lad o'grady said a set example of clambering down onto deck of lugger be followed by men first mate six sailor also springing on board hatch be first put on to keep remnant of crew below sailor knotted halliard of main sail soldier tailed on to rope sail be rapidly run up mate put two of men at tiller soldier ran to gun be already loaded haul sheet to windward mate shouted four sailor aided by of soldier did so head soon payed off amid cheer from officer on deck lugger swept round mounted twelve gun o'grady divided officer non commissioned officer among taking charge of long pivot gun in bow take stiddy aim boy fire a gun bear on ought not to throw away shot at distance a lugger came out from behind sea horse gun after gun be fired white splinter on side of brig showed that most if not of shot have taken effect o'grady gun be last to speak out shot struck brig just above water line take round shouted to mate give boy on other side chance lugger put about starboard gun poured in content be way shouted a laboured away with men with to load pivot gun again will give two three more round then will get alongside ask for health brig however showed inclination to await attack shot have be hastily fired when lugger first gun told that be now enemy at once put down helm made off before wind be now very light load gun then out with oar captain o'grady shouted be jabers will have fellow let man attend to sea horse be from that be to take order besides said to terence there be signal book on board may hoist a many flag a like twelve sweep on board lugger be at once got out manned by three soldier o'grady continued to direct fire of pivot gun sent shot after shot into brig stern latter have four hundred yard start although also hurriedly got out sweep lugger gained upon crew clustered on taffrail kept up musketry fire upon party working pivot gun two of have be killed four wounded when o'grady said to others lave gun alone boy will be alongside of in few minute be use throwing away life by working run gun over to other side will give warming then go at sea horse have hoisted signal directly on board perceived that lugger be starting in pursuit of brig terence have informed commanding officer of o'grady replied know nothing about terence most likely mane 'good luck to chase blackguard capture ' let wood come near do want to hear idea of what signal may mane terence have just time to stop mate a be coming forward ship be signalling said have told captain o'grady sir terence replied doe not know what signal mean have doubt that be instruction to capture brig mean to do so officer laughed think that must be pity not to said will be alongside in ten minute think duty to tell what signal be can tell what be terence said be possible that in heat of action may forget to report to captain o'grady be right enough sir think be recall well will attend to presently terence laughed when within hundred yard of brig troop opened heavy musketry fire many of men making way up ratline so commanding brig deck be answered with brisk fire french shooting be wild by shouting of order confusion prevailed on board be evident that privateersman be disorganized by sight of troop capture of consort brig gun be hastily fired a must be brought to bear on lugger a forged alongside sweep have already be got in lugger eight gun poured content simultaneously into brig then withering volley be fired headed by o'grady soldier sprang on board brig a did so however french flag fluttered down from peak privateersman threw down arm english broadside volley fired at close quarter have taken terrible effect of crew of eighty men be killed large proportion of rest wounded soldier gave three hearty cheer a flag came down privateersman be at once ordered below lieutenant hunter o'grady said do go on board lugger with left wing of company mr wood think have better stay here there be good many more sail to manage than there be in lugger one man here will be enough to steer will pull at rope for put others on board lugger by by mr wood said see that ship have hoisted signal doe mean believe that to be recall sir told mr o'connor ought to have reported same to o'grady said severely however will obey at once sea horse be lying head to wind mile half away two prize ran rapidly up to be received with tremendous cheer from men closely packed along bulwark o'grady at once lowered boat be rowed to sea horse taking terence with have done extremely well captain o'grady major harrison said a reached deck congratulate heartily must however have obeyed order of recall brig might have proved too strong for bound on service a be have right to risk valuable life except in self defence sure knew nothing about signal o'grady said with air of innocence thought just meant beore power to ye give hot ' something of kind be not until after have taken brig be told that be order of recall a soon a learned that came along a fast a must to mr wood must surely have known mr wood did tell major terence put in somehow forgot to mention to captain o'grady there be laugh among officer standing round ought to have informed at once mr o'connor major said with attempt at gravity however went on with change of voice owe so much to that must overlook a there can be very little doubt have not be for happy idea of taking possession of lugger must have be obliged to surrender for must not have be justified in holding out until ship sank under will not fail in reporting matter to do full credit for share in now what be loss captain o'grady three men killed eleven wounded sir what be of enemy thirty two killed about same number of wounded more le have not time to count before sent down have not time afterwards for be occupied in obeying order of recall be sorry that have killed so many of poor beggar if have hauled down flag when got up with there must have be occasion for must have told captain that looked upon a obstinate pig a first officer be killed there be use in spaking to well have be very satisfactory operation major said be very well out of very nasty fix now will go back to brig captain o'grady prepare to send prisoner on board will send boat for doctor daly doctor o'flaherty will go on board with see to wounded french english doctor daly will bring worst case on board here will leave o'flaherty on brig to look after others will be better there than in crowded ship first officer will remain there with with five men will retain fifty men of own company second officer with five men will take charge of lugger will have with fifty men of captain o'driscol company under officer will give little more room on board here how many prisoner be there counting wounded major there be about fifty of crew be eighty strong to begin with there be only thirty including slightly wounded to look after if brig hold be clear think that have better take charge of at present will both lie to beside here till have completed repair when make sail be to follow keep a close a possible on account captain o'grady be to undertake cruise on own account will bear in mind major will do can to keep up with laugh ran round circle of officer at o'grady obstinacy in considering sea horse to be fast vessel in spite of evidence that have have to contrary major said gravely will have to go under easiest sail possible brig can go two foot to craft one will only want lower sail if put on more will be running ahead losing at night will show light over stern on account be to allow yourselves to lose sight of party of men be already at work nailing batten over shattered stern of sea horse when be done sail cloth be nailed over coat of pitch given to operation took four hour by time other arrangement have be completed hold of two privateer be found to be empty learned from french crew that two craft have sailed from bordeaux in company four day previously that sea horse be first english ship that have come across will remember captain o'grady major said a officer prepared to go on board that mr wood be in command of vessel that be not to be interfered with in way with regard to making taking in sail have received precise instruction a to keeping near duty will be confined to keeping guard over prisoner rendering such assistance to sailor a may require understand major suppose that in case be attacked may take share in divarsion be going on think that there be much chance of being attacked o'grady if be instruction will be signalled to french privateer be not likely to interfere with seeing that be together if by ill luck french frigate must fall in with will have instruction to sheer off at once for of to make way to lisbon a quickly a can see have transferred four gun from of craft to take place of rotten cannon on board here united force must be of avail at against frigate must send to bottom with single broadside can run fight in wretched old tub if do see french frigate coming will transfer rest of troop to prize send off at once leave sea horse to fate of course must be very crowded on board privateer must not matter for few day so see importance of keeping quite close to in readiness to come alongside at once if signalled to will separate a soon a leave ship so a to ensure at least force reaching destination captain o'driscol took terence with on board lugger leaving lieutenant in charge of wing remained on board ship have done credit to company to choice of terence said warmly a stood together on deck of lugger did not see anything for french prison must have broken heart to be tied up there while rest of lad be fighting french in portugal thought that must make good officer day in spite of love of devilment did not think that before have be three week in service must have saved regiment from french prison chapter iii disembarked a soon a vessel be under way again be found that lugger be obliged to lower main sail to keep in position astern of sea horse while brig be forced to take in sail after sail until whole of upper sail have be furled be tedious work going along like o'driscol said doe not so much matter because a yet know where be going to land sir arthur have gone on in fast ship to corunna to see spanish junta there find out what assistance be likely to get from northern spain will be little enough expect will take money arm give plenty of fine promise in return hing be game have be playing in south if there be grain of sense among minister must see that be not of slightest use to reckon on spain a to portugal know very little at present expect there be not pin to choose between spaniard then be not going to lisbon terence said in surprise expect not sir arthur wo determine anything until join after visit to corunna think that will be at lisbon anyhow there be strong fort guarding mouth of river ten twelve thousand troop in city russian fleet anchored in port know where will be think that will be lisbon expect that will slip into little port land wait for junot to attack will be joined expect by stewart force have be fooling about for two three month waiting for spaniard to make up mind whether will admit into cadiz not see at present there be only of say that junot have at least in portugal of course be scattered about be hardly likely that must venture to withdraw garrison from large town so that odds may not be a heavy a look when meet in field suppose at rate of portuguese will join from what hear peasantry be brave enough only have never have chance yet of making fight for owing to miserable government never can make up mind to do anything hope that sir arthur have order a soon a take lisbon to assume entire control of country ignore native government altogether even if be worth anything be sure not to be be better to have one head than two a will have to do fighting be just a well that must have whole control of thing too for four day sailed along quietly on morning of fifth signal be run up from sea horse for prize to close up to mr wood mate on board brig at once sent sailor up to mast head there be large ship away to south west sir shouted down what doe look like can only see royal top sail yet by square cut think that be ship of war do think be french english can not say for certain yet sir look to a if be french think that sail be english cut anyhow such be evidently opinion on board sea horse for a prize came up within hundred yard of be hailed by major through speaking trumpet ordered to keep at distance for present to be in readiness to come up alongside directly order be given to effect in half hour look out reported that must now see lower sail of stranger have very little doubt that be large french frigate scarcely have done so before two prize be ordered to close up to sea horse sea be very calm be able to lie alongside a soon a did so troop began to be transferred to in quarter of hour operation be completed major harrison taking place on board lugger men be ordered below prize sheered off from sea horse frenchman be bearing down straight for said to o'driscol be bringing breeze down with in hour will be alongside will wait half hour then must leave sea horse to fate except for store be worthless well terence have suggestion to offer got out of last scrape though be not quite so bad a that be unpleasant enough frigate when come near will see that sea horse be slow sailer will probably leave to be picked up at leisure will go off in chase either of brig brig be to make for north west will steer south east so will have to make choice between when get breeze will either of give good dance before catch be if breeze be not too strong if be weight must soon bring up to yes major perhaps may not trouble about at must see at once that lugger brig be french if be to hoist french colour sea horse be to fly french colour over english must naturally suppose that have be captured by must go straight on course without troubling further about so might terence at rate scheme be worth trying if have anything like good glass on board must make out colour mile away if held on towards after that there must be plenty of time for to run if saw change course must know that be safe head be good for other thing besides mischief lad lugger sailed up near ship again major gave captain instruction to hoist french ensign over english one then sailing near brig told to hoist french colour keep men down below line of bulwark o'grady mr wood have better get boat down row alongside of ship ask captain to get sling at work hoist of store into will do same on other side tell captain to lower couple of boat also take twenty soldier on board with without jacket will do same so that may be seen that have strong party on board getting out cargo in few minute order be carried out forty soldier be at work on deck of sea horse slinging up tent from below lowering into boat alongside approach of frigate be anxiously watched from deck of prize upper sail of sea horse have be furled privateer under smallest possible canvas kept abreast of at distance of couple of length hull of french frigate be now visible be very fast mate said to major be safe to catch one of if breeze have got hold a came nearer feeling of anxiety heightened ought to make out colour now sir almost immediately afterwards frigate be seen to change course head be turned more to east suppressed cheer broke from troop be right now sir mate said be making for brest have fooled nicely boat passed repassed between sea horse prize frigate crossed little more than mile ahead five twenty gun side major said by jove must have made short work of a be not advisable to make change in position until frigate be far on way boat continued to pas to fro carrying back to sea horse store have just be removed until frenchman be five six mile away think that might make sail again captain major then hailed think that have better give hour sir be to see making sail with prize to south must excite suspicion at once captain might take into head to come back again to inquire into hour will surely be sufficient major said be travelling at eight nine knot hour be evidently bound for port must be unlikely in extreme that commander must beat back ten mile on what after might be fool errand be true enough sir then in hour will be ready to sail again major be rowed to sea horse may a well transfer men at once said have have very narrow escape of captain there be doubt that owe safety entirely to sharpness of young ensign must have be sunk taken if have not suggested manning lugger in first place of pretending that ship have be captured by french privateer in second be right major half hour craft must have foundered under frigate must certainly have captured sea horse one of prize if frenchman have not a thought seen two privateer at work emptying hold be sharp young fellow that be major agreed have be brought up with regiment have always be up to prank of kind have used wit to good purpose time have doubt will turn out excellent officer before sail be made major summoned officer on board sea horse troop from lugger brig be drawn up on deck major standing on poop said in voice must be heard from end to end of ship officer men have have narrow escape from french prison a be possible that before arrive at destination may fall in with enemy again not be so lucky think right to take occasion at once of thanking mr o connor before in own name in yours for to intelligence quickness of wit be entirely due that escaped being captured when brig be pounding with shot without being able to make return be certain that in short time must have have to haul down flag be sunk be who suggested that must take possession of lugger with gun drive off brig a result of suggestion craft be saved from being sunk brig be also captured in second place when french frigate be bearing down upon capture seemed certain be who suggested to that by hoisting french flag appearing to be engaged in transferring cargo of ship to privateer might throw dust into eye of frenchman a saw ruse succeeded perfectly therefore mr o'connor thank most heartily in own name in of fellow officer also in name of four hundred men of regiment of ship company for manner in have by quickness good sense saved from french prison saved majesty from loss of wing of fine regiment a concluded men broke into loud cheering officer gathered around terence thanked congratulated most heartily on service that have rendered be broth of boy terence captain o'grady said knew that be in along must not give brass farthing for lad who have not spice of divil ment in show that have got wit about that when steddys down will be hard to bate terence be so much overpowered at praise have received that beyond protesting that be quite undeserved have reply to make to congratulation that received from captain o'driscol seeing that be on verge of breaking down at once called upon to take place in boat rowed with to lugger few minute later sail be set on sea horse with yard braced tautly aft laid course south close hauled fresh breeze be now blowing ploughed way through water at rate almost justified o'grady panegyric upon in three day entered port of vigo where convoy be to rendezvous be glad to find that whole fleet be still there on anchoring major went on board dauphin have brought headquarters other wing of regiment be heartily greeted by colonel be getting very uneasy about harrison said last ship of convoy came in three day ago began to fear that must have be either dismasted sunk in gale saw senior naval officer morning said that if did not come in during day must send frigate out in search of must see by manner that thought most likely that have gone down so may imagine how pleased be when made out number though must not for life of make out what two craft flying english colour over french came in after be of course have nothing to do with suppose be two privateer have be captured by one of frigate sent in here with prize crew to refit before going home have of be knocked about bit will tell about directly colonel be rather long story have have narrow squeak of got through storm pretty well have bad time of afterwards owe entirely to young o'connor that be not of in prison at brest at present say so wait moment will call father here will be glad to hear that young scamp have behaved well may a well call up will like to hear story turning to group of officer who be standing on quarter deck short distance away waiting to hear news when major have given report said may a well come now hear major harrison story will save telling twice will be glad to hear o'connor terence have be distinguishing in way though know not yet in what major say that if have not be for whole wing of regiment must have now be in french prison terence be always good at getting out of scrape colonel though say be not equally good in getting into be glad to hear that time have done something useful major then gave full account of adventure with privateer of subsequent escape from french frigate faith o'connor colonel said warmly holding out hand to congratulate most heartily be more than ever thought to do on terence account have misgiving when recommended for commission may congratulate a well a did so be sure lad have plenty in be afraid that be more likely to come out wrong way than right now turn out that have saved regiment for there be doubt from what harrison say that have done so thank colonel be glad indeed that boy have done credit to kindness be mighty bad scrape time got out of well of course major will give full report in writing of will send in to sir arthur arrived morning will go on board flag ship at once report a to prize who belong to have not least idea never heard of transport capturing couple of privateer before suppose a be taken up for king service prize be captured by majesty troop will rank a if taken by navy be certain amount of value will go to admiral anyhow bulk of will go must think to troop crew officer of ship of course sharing wo come to much head colonel anyhow see be empty there be simply value of ship suppose must fetch above five six hundred apiece still thing must be done in regular way must leave in admiral hand will take boat major go to at once will find pen ink in cabin must be glad if must write report by time return then will go off at once to sir arthur have already written colonel major said producing document look to rather long harrison busy a sir arthur must be might not take trouble to read wish must write out a concise a can make of actual affair saying at end that beg to report especially conduct of ensign o'connor to whose suggestion escape of ship from privateer french frigate be due will hand that in a official report with other saying that give further detail of affair of course with must give in official letter from inclosing two report first will go see admiral in little over hour returned admiral know more than do whether navy have anything to do with prize not being so small in value doe not want to trouble about say that matter must entail end of correspondence bother that craft might rot at anchor before matter be decided think best thing can do will be to sell two vessel for what will fetch divide money according to prize rule say nothing about in way there be not likely ever to be question about while if admiralty horse guard once get into correspondence over matter there be saying what bother might have that must advise if adopt plan to simply scuttle report that have sunk now will just write official letter take to head quarter in two hour be back again have not seen chief said gave report to adjutant general general fane be with be old friend of mine told story of voyage adjutant general joined in conversation fane be waiting to go in to sir arthur who be dictating despatch to england said that if have chance must mention affair to sir arthur at rate other officer said that must lay report before with such mention that sir arthur must doubtless look through find that there be bit of insurrection going on in portugal that one think much will come of a band of unarmed peasant can have chance with french nothing be determined a yet about landing lisbon tagus be completely in hand of french sir arthur be going down to oporto to morrow where be likely that will learn more about situation than did at corunna fane say that hope will soon be ashore a general be not man to let grass grow under foot after holding counsel with officer colonel determined to adopt advice have received to sell two craft for what must fetch officer agreeing to refund share if question be ever asked on subject captain of sea horse agreed to accept share of captain in line mate of first second lieutenant colonel put in communication with merchant on shore two craft be sold for twelve hundred pound gave something over pound head to soldier crew twice amount to non commissioned officer sum varying from ten pound apiece to ensign to fifty pound to major admiral be asked to approve of transaction said ' have right formally to sanction since so far a know be not strictly naval matter will give letter colonel saying that have informed of course that have adopted that consider under peculiar circumstance of capture fact that there be men available for sending prize to england course be best most convenient must possibly be adopted though have craft be of great value must of course have be necessary to refer matter home ' week passed without movement expedition have left england on th of july sir arthur rejoined towards end of month have learned at oporto from colonel brown agent there contrary to what have be told at corunna there be spanish troop in north of portugal that body of portuguese irregular militia half armed slightly disciplined be assembled on river mondego after consultation with admiral sir charles cotton sir arthur have concluded that attack at mouth of tagus be impracticable owing to strength of french there position of fort commanded entrance of river heavy surf broke in undefended creek bay near there be then choice of landing far enough north of lisbon to ensure disembarkation undisputed by french else to sail south join spencer act against french army under dupont sir arthur finally determined that mondego river be most practicable for enterprise fort of figueira at mouth be already occupied by british marine portuguese force be at least sufficient to deter small body of troop approaching neighbourhood therefore to great joy of troop order be given that fleet must sail on following morning two day later anchored off mouth of mondego just before starting vessel arrived with despatch from spencer saying that be at st mary be free to act with sir arthur fast vessel be despatched with order to to sail to mondego on arriving there sir arthur received mortifying intelligence that sir hew dalrymple have be appointed over head nevertheless continued to push on own plan with vigour pending arrival of general with bad news came information that french general dupont have be defeated set free small force under general anstruther fast sailing craft be at once despatched to find command order to sail at once to mondego without further delay however landing of troop began on st of august men gun store be ashore by th on day spencer fortunately arrived with men have not received sir arthur order moment dupont surrendered have sailed for tagus have learned from sir c cotton who commanded fleet at entrance to river where sir arthur be at once sailed to join while troop be disembarking sir arthur have gone over to portuguese head quarter two mile distant to confer with bernardin friere portuguese commander in chief visit be disappointing one found that portuguese troop be almost unarmed commander be full of inflated idea proposed that force must unite that must relinquish coast march into interior commence offensive campaign be lavish in promise to provide ample store of provision english general saw however that effectual assistance must be hoped for from portuguese troop a little from promise of commander gave friere musket for troop absolutely declined to adopt proposed plan own intention being to keep near coast where must receive supply from ship be joined by reinforcement a soon a have landed mayo regiment be marched to village two mile inland with two others of same brigade encamped near idea of keeping up regimental officer mess have be abandoned a soon a tent be pitched troop have settled down in o'grady said to terence will go into village see if can find suitable place for taking meal may be that in time fellow will learn how to cook for by jabers will live dacent a long a can servant tim hoolan have gone on ahead to look

did say that most rigiment be catholic did not say of must go explain matter to hoolan if call upon a like may do must find out at once that have desaved sure honour if think that be necessary of course must be done must not be a well to go to shebeen first to take possession of room to get comfortably settled down in before ye give away think might be worth while tim o'grady said gravely what do say terence think matter will keep for few hour terence said laughing when be once settled there will be very hard to turn out room be found to be larger than have expected o'grady proposed that must admit whole officer of wing to share with to terence at once agreed heartily think that with little squeezing place must hold officer of five company major o'flaherty more of there be merrier le fear of being turned out be so have better put name up on door go down try make black browed landlord understand that want paper pen ink with difficulty much gesticulation terence succeeded name of

outside terence left part of work to hoolan who by bringing up number of plate ranging on table getting down ham cutting into slice by pointing to wine skin managed to acquaint landlord with what be required in be good deal aided by man two niece who acted a assistant who be much quicker in catching meaning than be landlord very soon room below be crowded with officer from other regiment hoolan

to do debenham can take liquor in moderation have never remarked that o'grady one of others put in in great moderation o'grady said gravely be again interrupted by shout of laughter ye have to be helped home last night o'grady took hoolan quarter of hour to wake morning heard say 'now master dear bugle will sound in minute two be wake must there will be divil of botheration over ' looked in there be hoolan be standing by side of shaking head gravely a if be hopeless job that have in hand if have not emptied water bottle over must never have be on parade in time oh be be o'grady said wrathfully hoolan swore by saint that have not seen who be never mind boy will be even wid ye yet o'grady be not to be waked in fashion mind owe one though be not saying must have be on parade in time if have not done only just saved bacon hardly terence laughed for adjutant be down upon pretty sharply coatee be buttoned up wrong hair have not be brushed stuck up way below shako sword belt be awry looked worse than did when brought home well be poor heart never rejoices terence must make night of boy if tent be to be struck before daylight will be mighty little use turning in wo catch sitting up night terence said with perhaps twenty mile march in morning maybe fight at end of if be to leirya be going will be nearer thirty mile than twenty even seasoned vessel a be will find long walk after being up night having have pretty hard work to day can not hold wid general there o'grady said gravely have be kapeing at from daybreak till night ivery day since landed marching men foot off be very well to march when have got to march to keep tramping fifteen twenty mile day when there be occasion for be out of reason will march better for to morrow o'grady have be hard work certainly not harder than be marching down to cork must have good many straggler to morrow if have not be for last week work have got dozen footsore men in company alone must have fifty to morrow night if men have not have marching to get fit be very well for terence who have be tramping over hill round athlone since be gossoon be sure that if have not have that day off duty when showed priest round camp must have be kilt here be general order of day adjutant said a came in with captain o'connor general say now army be about to take field will expect strictest discipline to be maintained that straggler from rank will at once be handed over to provost marshal offence against peasantry property will be severely punished then there be two three order concern particularly then there be one concern terence general have received report from colonel corcoran of mayo fusilier stating that 'the transport carrying left wing of regiment be attacked by two french privateer must have be compelled to surrender being practically unarmed have not be for coolness quick wit of ensign terence o'connor having read report general commanding fully concurs express high satisfaction at conduct of ensign o'connor undoubtedly saved from capture wing of regiment there terence be feather in cap sir arthur be not given to praise unduly be seldom that ensign get into general order will do good day perhaps when least expect be heartily pleased lad captain o'connor said a laid hand upon terence shoulder be proud of have never seen own name in general order be heartily glad to see yours bedad when think that couple of month ago be running wild getting into sort of mischief seems hard to believe that must not only be one of have got name into general order for nothing father terence said call beastly shame just because thought of using that lugger must be cracked up more than others be not only that though terence gun crippled lugger must not have be fired if have not thought of putting rope round that french frigate must never have left alone have not suggested to major how to throw dust into eye lad thoroughly deserve credit that have got be sure that there be not man in regiment who must not say same gintlemen captain o'grady said solemnly will drink to health of ensign terence o'connor more power to elbow toast be duly honoured be mighty good of to propose o'grady went on after terence have said few word of thanks because have strong idea that in two three minute must have made just same suggestion that did lad knew at time that there be plan wanted to propose sorra word came to lip be just brimful with when came up took word out of mouth if have spoken first be brevet majority have got sure enough must be quicker next time o'grady adjutant said when laughter have subsided a say have missed good thing by slowness be afraid brain be still little muddled by indulgence night before just contrary boy feel that if have taken just one glass more of cratur brain must have be clearer must have be to fore bear malice terence maybe idea must not have managed to straighten out until after have have to haul down flag then must have be too late to have be good have happened to more than once before have just thought of good thing when be too late have occurred to most of o'grady captain o'connor said laughing terence see doe care for whisky perhaps have something to do with idea coming faster than ours well so be off to morrow though of course one know way be going to march must be either to leirya along coast road be good thing spencer have come up in time for there be saying how strong french may be though fancy be so scattered about after leaving garrison to keep lisbon in order holding other point junot will hardly be able at such short notice to gather force much superior to ours from what hear there be mighty strong position between lisbon if stick up on top of hill will have work to turn off again fancy will be to leirya adjutant said portuguese report that one french division be at candieros coming from abrantes sir arthur be likely to endeavour to prevent from uniting that evening there be grand feast at mess room colonel have be specially invited effort be made to do honour to occasion tim hoolan have be very successful in foraging expedition have brought in goose four duck have persuaded landlord niece to let cook have sole possession of kitchen banquet be great success majority of present did not sit very long afterwards colonel set example of rising early must advise gentleman to turn in soon said say where be to march to morrow can tell at least that march be very long one that be best to get a much sleep a possible for can assure that will be child play think that be quite probable will smell powder before day be over accordingly young officer several of senior left with o'grady several of hard drinker kept up until midnight observing however more moderation than usual in potation there be none of grumbling common when men be turned out of bed before dawn be in high spirit that time for action have arrived men be a eager to meet enemy a be officer tent be down placed in waggon before daylight regimental cook have already be at work officer went round saw that have have breakfast before fell in at six o'clock whole be under arm in place a central regiment in brigade tramped on without halt until eleven then bugle sounded fell out for hour men made meal from bread meat have be cooked night before man carrying three day ration in haversack there be halt longer one at two o'clock when brigade rested for hour in shade of grove be mighty pleasant to rest o'grady said a officer threw down on grass be starting that bates one feel that foot have swollen so that step take expect boot to burst with explosion faith if come to fighting will take off altogether swing at belt how can run after french when be cripple have better take boot off now o'grady one of others suggested be not aisy to get off how must get on again have got there there have got to stop bad ce to told hoolan to rub grease into for hour last night rascal be a drunk a owl there be more talking for man felt that hour sleep must do wonder for soon absolute quiet reigned in grove continued until bugle again called to foot knew now that be leirya be making for that ten mile still remained to be accomplished small body of cavalry accompanied now pushed on ahead when distance have be traversed trooper brought back news that enemy have not yet reached town be just six o'clock when brigade marched in amid cheer wild excitement of inhabitant waggon be not yet up troop be quartered in town tired many of foot sore proud of march have accomplished that have enabled to forestall french laborde indeed arrived same night at batalha eight mile distant on receiving news in morning that british have already occupied leirya advanced farther position be exceedingly difficult one order be to cover march of loison from abrantes to form junction with general to do so now must be to leave open road through alcobaca obidos to commanding position at torres vedras batalha offered position that must hope to defend until arrival of loison therefore sending word to general to move from torras nova a soon a reached that town to santarem then to march to join at rolica fell back to alcobaca then to obidos town with moorish castle built on gentle eminence in middle of valley leaving detachment here retired to rolica six mile to south of at point several road met at once covered approach to torres vedras important port of peniche must be joined by loison marching down from santarem advanced brigade of british force remained in quiet possession of leirya during next day on following th of august main body of army arrived having taken two day on march portuguese force also came in under friere that general at once took possession of magazine there although have promised english general that content must be entirely devoted to maintenance of english army divided among own force disgusted a british commander be at barefaced dishonesty be not in position to quarrel with portuguese be essential to that must accompany not for sake of assistance that must give for knew that none be to be expected from from political point of view be most important that people at large must feel that own troop be acting with british that feeling of jealousy suspicion of latter must arise friere be acting under order of bishop junta of oporto whose great object be to keep portuguese army together not to risk defeat a desired to keep body intact in order that if british be defeated must be able to make favourable term for consequently even after appropriating whole of store provision found at leirya friere continued to make exorbitant demand to offer vigorous opposition to further advance so far did carry that british general finding that in other way must get portuguese to advance with proposed that must follow behind wait result of battle to friere at last consented portuguese in fact have belief that british troop must be able to withstand onslaught of french whom regarded a invincible colonel trant however one of military agent succeeded in inducing friere to place infantry cavalry under command of sir arthur addition of cavalry be very useful one for english have with only mounted men country be entirely new to scarcely officer must speak language there be mean therefore of obtaining information a to movement of enemy moving forward through batalha regaining coast road at british force arrived at caldas on th on same day junot quitted lisbon with force of infantry cavalry ten piece of artillery leaving to garrison fort keep down population of city force be conveyed to villa franca by water general then pushed forward to santarem where found loison took command of division british advanced guard after arriving at caldas pushed forward drove french picket out of brilos then from obidos here however slight reverse took place company of th th rifle pressed forward three mile farther in pursuit when be suddenly attacked in flank by greatly superior force have not be that general spencer whose division be short distance behind pressed forward to assistance must have suffered heavily a be escaped with loss of two officer twenty seven men killed wounded rashness however led to discovery that laborde force have taken up strong position in front of village of rolica that apparently intended to give battle there next day be spent in reconnoitring french position be very strong one rolica stood on table land rising in valley affording view of road a far a obidos various point of defence there on flank be held by strong party of enemy mile in rear be steep lofty ridge afforded strong second line of defence by side of ridge road passed through deep defile then mounted over pas through range of hill extending from sea to tagus occupying intermediate ground until close to lisbon laborde position be embarrassing one if retired upon torres vedras line of communication with loison must be lost if moved to meet loison must leave open direct road to lisbon while if remained at rolica have to encounter force almost three time own strength trusting in advantage of position confident in valour of troop chose last alternative very anxiously during day british officer watched french line of defence fearful lest enemy must again retreat by sunset came to conclusion that laborde intended to stay where be to meet french indeed have be so accustomed to beat spanish portuguese that have not woke up to fact that have troop of very different material facing ought to have easy work major harrison said a officer gathered round fire have be built in front of colonel tent people here declare that laborde have not above troop with while counting trant portuguese have nearly there will be credit in thrashing with such odds a dick ryan grumbled suppose ryan major harrison said if have be in sir arthur place must have preferred remaining at leirya until junot must have gathered force obtained reinforcement of fifty thousand so from spain then must have issued general order saying that a enemy have now hundred thousand troop ready army must advance smite not so bad a major young ensign said colouring a there be general laugh from rest there doe not seem much satisfaction in thrashing enemy when be three to one against be just art of war ryan of course be glorious to defeat greatly superior army to lose own in doing so that may be heroic be not modern war object of general be if possible to defeat enemy in detail to so manoeuvre that be always superior in strength to force be immediately in front of so to ensure victory after victory until enemy be destroyed be what general be doing by skilful manoeuvring have prevented junot from massing whole of army of portugal against to morrow will defeat laborde doubtless day two later will fight loison then suppose will advance against lisbon junot will collect beaten troop garrison there will be battle then will capture lisbon french will have to evacuate portugal whereas if french be at rolica must probably smash into cocked hat in spite of valour might show a have cavalry to cover retreat a miserable horse can scarcely drag few gun that have got carriage be so rickety that artillery officer be afraid that a soon a fire will shake to piece be not probable that single man must regain ship please say more major see be fool still captain o'connor said must own major that one doe like to win against odds quite so o'connor individual who may survive battle doubt must be glad that be superior force that have beaten then see battle be not fought for satisfaction of individual moreover must remember that proportion of loss be much heavier when number be pretty equally matched for in case must meet to certain extent face to face skill on part of general may do great deal in end must come to sheer hard fighting now expect that to morrow although there may be hard fighting be not upon that sir arthur will principally rely for turning french out of strong position will no doubt advance directly against with perhaps force rest will move along on top of height so threaten to cut french line of retreat altogether laborde be say good general therefore wo wait until be caught in trap will fall back a soon a see that line of retreat be seriously menaced fancy too that must expect loison up time tomorrow must hardly make stand if loison doe come up ryan wish will be gratified will be having odds against then must remember that army be very raw one large proportion of be newly raised though there may be few men here who fought in great bulk have never seen shot fired in earnest while on other hand french have be fighting over europe be accustomed to victory be confident in own valour discipline officer be a raw a men must expect that sort of blunder will be made at first can tell that be very well satisfied that first battle be going to be fought with odds greatly on side in six month must feel pretty confident even if french have same odds on side major gave rather hotly dick terence said to friend a sauntered off together from group be glad that spoke first for have on tip of tongue to say just what did expect that good many of others felt just same yes put foot in badly terence have doubt major be right anyhow have nothing to say against for wish that be not so strong that be stronger what credit be there must like to know in thrashing when be three to one anyhow hope that will have share in scrimmage will get idea when order be published to night will see where fane brigade be to be put chapter v rolica vimiera at nine o'clock in evening became known that general plan of attack predicted by major harrison be to be carried out five thousand men under general ferguson be to ascend hill on left of valley while trant with thousand portuguese infantry portuguese horse be to move on hill on right centre nine thousand strong commanded by sir arthur be to march straight up valley early in morning british troop marched out from obidos ferguson command at once turned to left ascended hill while trant moved to west after proceeding short distance fane brigade moved off from road marched along valley equidistant from main body from ferguson forming connecting link between on reaching village of st mamed three quarter of mile from french position hill brigade turned off to right from elevated position french opened fire with artillery be answered by twelve gun in valley from ferguson six gun on height fane brigade extended to left be first in action drove back french skirmisher connected ferguson with centre then turned to attack right of french position while ferguson seeing sign of loison force descended from high ground to rear of fane while portuguese pressed forward at foot of hill on other side of valley threatened enemy left flank illustration battle of rolica map seeing that position be absolutely untenable laborde did not wait assault fell back covered by cavalry to far stronger position in rear momentary pause ensued before british continued advance new position of french be of great natural strength must be approached only by narrow path winding up through deep ravine on face ferguson fane received order to keep to left so turn enemy right trant similarly be to push forward threaten left flank while hill nightingale advanced against front battle commenced by storm of skirmisher from brigade running forward soon reached foot of precipitous hill plunged into pass fire of enemy difficulty of ascent checked spreading right left from path made way up taking advantage of shelter afforded by great boulder broken mass of rock stump of tree climbed up wherever must find foothold supporting column experienced much greater difficulty path be too narrow ground too broken for to retain formation made way forward a best must in necessary disorder din of battle be prodigious for rattle of musketry be echoed re echoed from rock progress of skirmisher must only be noted by light smoke rising through foliage by shout of soldier be echoed by still louder one of french gathered strongly on hill above a british made way up laborde who be still anxiously looking for expected coming of loison withdrew portion of troop from left strengthened right in order to hold on a long a possible on side from aid be expected ardour of british to get to close quarter favoured movement have be intended that th th regiment must take right hand path where track be following up pas forked so join trant portuguese at top of hill fall upon french left left hand path however be one must take direct to enemy th be leading took th followed so rapidly did press up hill that arrived at crest before ferguson fane on left trant on right have got far enough to menace line of retreat so shake enemy position consequence be that a right wing of th arrived at top of path be met by very heavy fire before must form company of french regiment who have be cut off from main body by sudden appearance charged through disordered troop carried with major fifty sixty other prisoner rest of wing thus exposed to full fire of french fell back over crest there rallied on left wing being joined by th pushed forward again obtained footing on plateau laborde in vain endeavoured to hurl back again maintained footing suffered heavily colonel being killed with many officer men th regiment be now up at other point british be gathering thickly at edge of plateau ferguson trant be pushing on fast past french flank laborde seeing that further resistance must lead to great disaster gave order to retire to third position still farther in rear movement be conducted in splendid order french steadily fell back by alternate mass gun thundering on flank while cavalry covered rear by repeated charge gaining third position laborde held for time so enabled isolated body of force to join then finding unable to resist impetuosity of british attack retired still disputing foot of ground took to narrow pas of runa then marched night to strong position of montechique thereby securing junction with loison leaving road to torres vedras open to british loss of french in fight be killed wounded three gun laborde be among wounded british lost nearly killed wounded taken prisoner number of combatant actually engaged on side be about loss sustained showed obstinacy of fighting sir arthur believed that french have a retreated be joined by loison therefore prepared to march at once by coast line to seize height of torres vedras before french must throw in way great be disappointment among officer men of mayo fusilier that have taken part in actual fighting beyond driving in french skirmisher at beginning of operation divil man killed wounded captain o'grady remarked mournfully a regiment halted at conclusion of fight faith be too bad entirely there be left out in cold scarce shot have be fired there be plenty of others in same case captain o'driscol said none of three brigade on left have have anything to do with matter a far a fighting went think more than four thousand of troop be in action see if have not be for advance hill nightingale might not have succeeded in driving laborde off hill there be doubt that french fought well be advance that forced to retire not troop in front of so that even if have not have killed wounded o'grady have at least satisfaction of having contributed to victory oh bother tactic have come here to fight fighting have have at at when marched out morning looked a if be going to have share in divarshon have be fairly chated out of well o'grady must not grumble terence said for have fighting on way out be more than of other troop have be mere skirmish terence first of be shot at must not shoot back again thin shot at enemy must not shoot back at a for boarding affair faith did not last minute others have have two hour of steady fighting clambering up hill banging away at enemy shouting cheering sort of fun there be tramping along among bastely stone rock one a much a took trouble to fire shot at well if have be there o'grady must have lost about hundred twenty men officer if have suffered in same proportion a others must now be mourning loss perhaps among might have be saying 'there be o'grady gone be beggar to talk meant well faith drink bill of regiment will fall off ' well might have be so o'grady said in more contented voice if have be killed going up hill without even a much a catching glimpse of frenchies must niver have forgiven niver there be roar of laughter at bull phwat be have said asked in surprise nothing o'grady must be awful thing for french to know that after death must have gone on hating for ever did say that know maneing a long a know that what doe matter way put well now suppose sir arthur be going to take tramping along again ah be weary thing being soldier why be saying yesterday o'grady foot be getting all right terence said right in manner terence be bad habit that have got of picking up supayrior officer word throwing into teeth will come to bad end if break of worst of be be corrupting other lad young officer be losing respect for senior be surprised major that colonel take matter in hand before discipline of regiment be destroyed entirely draw upon o'grady be good for to have laugh sometimes must have missed sorely have gone down on hill over there a many good fellow have done hear that th th have lost colonel lord presarve from misfortune major must give step through regiment then see stopped mean must be colonel o'grady major said with laugh know must not take thing a quietly a doe well see there be consolation round firing have ceased at four o'clock until late night large portion of force be occupied in searching ground have be traversed burying dead carrying wounded of nationality down into hospital have be established at rolica sir arthur determined to march at daybreak so a to secure pass through torres vedras in evening messenger arrived with news that anstruther acland division with large fleet of store ship be off coast dangerous nature of coast certainty must gale spring up large proportion of ship must be wrecked rendered absolutely necessary to secure disembarkation of troop at once next morning therefore only marched ten mile to lourinha thence advanced to vimiera eight mile farther where covered disembarkation of troop next day anstruther brigade be with difficulty loss landed on open sandy beach on night of th acland brigade be disembarked at maciera bay reinforcement be most opportune for already british have proof that junot be preparing heavy blow that general have indeed lost time in taking step to bring on decisive battle while british be marching to lourinha have with loison division crossed line of laborde retreat on same evening reached torres vedras where next day be joined by laborde on th by reserve in meantime sent forward cavalry scoured country round rear of british camp prevented general from obtaining information a to position intention arrival of acland brigade on night of th increased fighting strength of army to men with eighteen gun exclusive of trant portuguese while sir arthur judged that junot must not put more than in field previous to leaving mondego have sent to sir harry burrard notice of plan of campaign advising to let sir john moore on arrival with men disembark there march on santarem where must protect left of army in advance block line of tagus menace french line of communication between lisbon important fortress of elvas ground at santarem be suited for defence moore must be joined with friere who be still with men at general intended to make forced march keeping by sea road strong advance guard must press forward occupy formidable position of mathia in rear of hill with main body intended to seize height few mile behind torres vedras to cut road between place montechique on direct road to lisbon so interpose between junot capital at twelve o'clock night sir arthur be roused by messenger who reported that junot with men be advancing to attack be hour march distant disbelieved account of force of enemy have doubt that messenger fear have exaggerated closeness of approach therefore contented with sending order to picket to use redoubled vigilance at daylight whole british force be a usual under arm nothing must have suited british commander better than junot must attack for position of vimiera be strong town be situated in valley through little river maciera flow in be placed commissariat store while cavalry portuguese be on small plain behind village in front of vimiera be steep hill with flat top commanding ground to south east for considerable distance fane be infantry with six gun be posted here fane left rested on churchyard blocking road led round declivity of hill to town behind position separated by river road be hill extending in half moon to sea illustration battle of vimiera map five brigade of infantry forming british right occupied mountain on other side of ravine formed by river just beyond vimiera be strong narrow range of height there be water to be found on ridge only th regiment picket be stationed here be vastly better to be attacked in position than to be compelled to storm height of torres vedras held by strong french army advance of french be fortunate in respect on th sir harry burrard arrived in bay on board frigate sir arthur thus superseded went on board to report position of affair renewing recommendation that sir john moore must land at mondego march to santarem sir harry burrard however have already determined that force must land at maciera refused to permit sir arthur plan of advance to be carried out ordered that offensive step must be undertaken until sir john moore have landed advance of junot happily left wellesley at liberty to act disposing force in order of battle awaited appearance of enemy be not until seven o'clock that cloud of dust be seen rising above opposite ridge hour later body of cavalry crowned height sent out swarm of scout in direction almost immediately afterwards body of cavalry infantry be seen marching along road from torres vedras to lourinha threatening to turn left of british position a british right be not menaced four of brigade on hill on flank be ordered to cross valley to take post with th regiment for defence of ridge movement being covered by vimiera height be unseen by enemy th brigade portuguese be on second ridge behind other thus assisted to cover english left protect rear ground between crest on french be first seen position be so thickly covered with wood after enemy have descended into correct view of movement must be obtained junot have intended to fall upon english army at daybreak defile through force have to pas have delayed march a have fatigue of troop who have be marching night from height from obtained view of british position seemed to that british centre right be held in great strength that left be almost unguarded therefore determined to attack upon flank indeed be in case most favourable a be successful there must cut line of british retreat pen up on sea shore march of four brigade through vimiera to take post on british left be hidden from divided force into two heavy column one of be to attack british left having mounted height to sweep before into town other be to attack vimiera hill held by anstruther fane brennier commanded attack against left laborde against centre loison followed at short distance kellermann commanded reserve of grenadier unfortunately for success of junot plan be unaware of fact that along foot of ridge on british left ran deep ravine rendered very difficult to attack except at extreme end of position be going to have share of fun to day o'grady said a stood with group of officer watching wooded plain head of laborde column debouching from among tree moving towards hill there be general murmur of satisfaction from officer for although have laughed at o'grady exaggerated regret at not being engaged at rolica be somewhat sore at regiment having have opportunity of distinguishing on occasion sooner have column cleared wood than six gun posted with fane be brigade at once opened fire upon have be intended that brennier attack must begin at same time a laborde that advance have be stopped by defile be so steep so encumbered with rock brushwood tree that troop have most extreme difficulty in making way across enabled acland whose brigade be in act of mounting height from town to turn battery against laborde column be thus smitten with shower of grape in front flank to be added heavy musketry fire from three brigade take easy lad take easy colonel said a walked up down rank be hardly in range yet have better keep ammunition until get to foot of hill then can blaze away a hard a like junot receiving news of arrest of brennier column obstacle that have encountered seeing that whole british fire be now directed against laborde ordered loison to support general with one brigade directed solignac to turn ravine in brennier be entangled to fall upon left extremity of enemy line fane have be given discretionary power to call up reserve artillery posted in village behind seeing so strong attack against position about to be made called up to top of hill loison laborde now formed troop into three column of attack one advanced against part of hill held by anstruther brigade endeavoured to penetrate by road past church on fane extreme left while main column represented by large number of best troop advanced against centre of position reserve artillery battery originally there opened terrible fire be aided by musketry of infantry with loud shout french pressed forward although already shaken by terrible fire of artillery breathless from exertion gained crest of hill before must re form tremendous volley be poured into with wild yell mayo fusilier th charged in front flank hurled down hill in meantime anstruther having repulsed le serious attack made on detached d to check enemy column moving through churchyard prevented advance until kellermann brought up force of grenadier who running forward with loud shout drove back advanced company of d gun on height be turned upon with great effect of acland bowe brigade on left of ridge took in flank brought almost to stand still then d in one mass charged furiously down on column after fierce struggle drove back in confusion french attack on side have now completely failed colonel taylor riding out with little body of cavalry dashed out into confused mass slaying scattering margaron who commanded superior force of french cavalry led down through infantry falling upon british force killed taylor cut squadron to piece kellermann took post with reserve of grenadier in pine wood in advance of wooded country through have advanced while margaron horseman maintained position covering retreat of fugitive into wood at moment solignac reached assigned position encountered ferguson brigade be on extreme left of division be taken by surprise on finding force equal to own where have expected to find hill untenanted ferguson be drawn up in three line on steep declivity heavy artillery fire opened upon french a soon a be seen while th brigade portuguese marched along next ridge threatened enemy rear ferguson did not wait to be attacked marched brigade against french who falling fast under musketry artillery fire have swept line fell back fighting to farthest edge of ridge solignac be carried off severely wounded brigade be cut off from line of retreat driven into low valley in stood village of peranza leaving six gun behind ferguson left two regiment to guard gun with rest of force pressed hard upon french at moment brennier who have at last surmounted difficulty have detained fell upon two regiment suddenly retook gun d st speedily recovered from surprise rallied on higher ground then after pouring in tremendous volley of musketry charged with mighty shout overthrew french brigade recovered gun brennier be wounded taken prisoner ferguson having completely broken up brigade opposed to must have forced greater part of solignac troop to surrender if have not be required to halt by unexpected order french veteran speedily rallied in admirable order protected by cavalry marched off to join comrade who have be defeated in attack upon british centre be now twelve o'clock victory be complete thirteen gun have be captured st th portuguese brigade have fired shot th th have suffered very little therefore sir arthur resolved with five brigade to push junot closely while hill anstruther fane be to march forward a far a torres vedras pushing on to montechique cut off from lisbon have operation be executed junot must probably have lost artillery seven thousand straggler must have be driven to seek shelter under gun of elvas from fortress however must have be cut off have moore landed a sir arthur wished at mondego unhappily however latter be no longer commander in chief sir harry burrard who have be present at action have not interfered with arrangement a soon a victory be won assumed command sent order arresting ferguson career of victory forbade further offensive operation until arrival of sir john moore adjutant general quartermaster supported view sir arthur earnest representation be disregarded sir arthur plan must probably have be crowned with success be not without peril french have rallied with extraordinary rapidity under protection of cavalry british artillery carriage be so shaken a to be almost unfit for service horse insufficient in number wretched in quality commissariat waggon in greatest confusion hired portuguese vehicle have made off in direction british cavalry be totally destroyed two french regiment have just made appearance on ridge behind wood where junot troop be reforming sir harry burrard with caution characteristic of age refused to adopt wellesley bold plan great success have be gained must have be imperilled by junot falling with force upon one other of british column sir arthur at later period when commission be appointed by parliament to inquire into circumstance admitted that though still believed that success must have attended own plan considered that sir harry burrard decision be fully justified on military ground junot took full advantage of unexpected cessation of hostility re formed broken army on arrival of two regiment brought up to original strength then covered by cavalry marched in good order until darkness fell have regained command of pass of torres vedras two army occupied precisely same position that have done on previous evening one general thirteen gun several hundred prisoner fell into hand of british junot total loss far exceeded that of british be comparatively small at commencement of fight british force be more than two thousand larger than of french of only half have taken active part in battle while man in junot army have be sent forward to attack sir harry burrard command be short one for on following morning sir hew dalrymple superseded thus in twenty four hour battle have be fought command of army have be three time changed striking proof of abject folly incapacity of british ministry of day two of three commander arrived fresh on scene without previous knowledge of situation three differed from other in view regarding general plan of campaign last two be men without previous experience in handling of large body of troop without high military reputation while man displaced have already shown most brilliant capacity in india be universally regarded a best general in british service dalrymple adopted energetic action advised by sir arthur inactivity supported by burrard taking middle course decided to advance on following morning not to go far until sir john moore landed at maciera sir arthur be strongly opposed to policy pointed out that there be at present on shore seven eight day provision for force at vimiera further supply must be obtained in country at moment gale might arise scatter destroy fleet from alone must draw supply during advance debate on subject be continuing when french general kellermann bearing flag of truce escorted by strong body of cavalry arrived at outpost desired conference news be surprising indeed junot force be practically unshaken possessed strong place in portugal must have received support in short time from french force in spain upon other hand position of british even after winning victory be by mean satisfactory one have already learnt that be useless to rely in slightest degree upon portuguese promise portuguese assistance even in matter of provision carriage commander in chief expected to be maintained by who have come to aid in freeing country of french instead of receiving help from in carriage british army be wholly deficient of cavalry have none when sir john moore landed there must be four day provision on shore for army be fleet driven off by gale starvation must at once threaten gallantry with french have fought in engagement skill with have be handled above quickness steadiness with after defeat have closed up rank drawn off in excellent order showed that task of expelling such troop from country must even if went well in other respect be very formidable one offer of conference be therefore at once embraced by sir hew dalrymple kellermann be admitted to camp mission be to demand cessation of arm in order that junot might under certain condition evacuate portugal advantage of freeing country from french without further fighting be so evident that sir hew at once agreed to discus term took sir arthur wellesley into counsel latter quite agreed with policy by strong french army must be quietly got out of country in held military post strong position great moral effect must be produced whole resource of portugal must then be available for operation in spain by afternoon main point of convention have be generally agreed upon french be to evacuate portugal be to be conveyed in english vessel to france with property public private there be to be persecution of person who have be adherent of france during occupation only serious difference that arose be a to russian fleet in tagus kellermann proposed to have guaranteed from capture with leave to return to baltic however be refused question be referred to admiral cotton who a chief representative of england must have to approve of treaty before must be signed kellermann returned to lisbon with colonel murray quartermaster general after three day negotiation treaty be finally concluded russian difficulty being settled by vessel being handed over to british crew transported in english ship to baltic convention be under circumstance unquestionably most advantageous one must have cost long severe fighting siege of several very strong fortress before french must have be turned out of portugal heavy siege gun must have be necessary for operation at very shortest calculation year must have be wasted very heavy loss of life incurred immense expenditure of money before result now obtained so suddenly unexpectedly have be arrived at nevertheless news of convention be received with burst of popular indignation in england where public wholly ignorant of difficulty of situation have formed most extravagant hope founded on two success obtained by troop result be that commission be appointed to investigate whole matter three english general be summoned to england to attend before so gross be misrepresentation lie by public have be deceived by agent of unscrupulous ambitious bishop of oporto confederate that be even proposed to bring general to trial who have in so short time with such insufficient mean freed portugal from french sir john moore remained in command of troop in portugal chapter vi pause mayo fusilier have suffered full proportion of loss at battle of vimiera major

left returned to regiment well dick what did think of battle asked chum quite know what did think doe not seem to that thought much about at what with noise of firing shouting of men whistle overhead of french round shot men cheering french shouting excitement there be time for thinking at from time skirmisher came running up hill to time when rolled french down seem to have be in dream be lucky have word of command to give for be sure must not have given think be frightened at somehow did not seem to think of danger be just horrible confusion felt very much like too be not bit like what be when took brig felt cool enough when jumped on to deck then there be noise to speak of while row morning be tremendous tried to cheer when men did must not hear own voice know whether made sound not delay of week took place after battle of vimiera mayo fusilier be not among troop who entered lisbon in order to overawe populace prevent attack upon french soldier officer portuguese suspected of leaning towards french cause throughout country everything be in confusion strong party at whose head be bishop of oporto friere denounced convention with french against whom have done nothing a gross treachery on part of english to portugal endeavoured in way to excite feeling of population in country capital against british in failed altogether for people be too thankful to get rid of oppression exaction of invader to feel aught satisfaction at being compelled to leave country junta at oporto at whose head be bishop desired to grasp entire power throughout country be furious at being thwarted in endeavour to prevent central junta being established at lisbon throughout spain also chaos reigned provincial junta refused co operation with others instead of concerting measure for resistance against great force that napoleon be assembling on frontier thought only of satisfying ambition greed of member general disregarded alike order from central junta at madrid of provincial junta quarrelled among to point sometimes approached open hostility acted only for private end arm have be sent in vast number from england yet while money so lavishly bestowed by british agent went into pocket of individual arm be retained by junta of seville cadiz maritime port army of spain be left almost unarmed term army be indeed absurd a applied to gathering of peasant without idea of discipline with scarcely instruction in drill in majority of case a result proved altogether deficient in courage yet while neglecting military precaution ready to crumble to piece at first approach of french arrogance insolence of authority civil military alike be absolutely unbounded disregarded wholly advice of british officer agent treated men who alone must save from consequence of folly with open contempt after fortnight halt at vimiera mayo fusilier be marched with four other regiment to torres vedras where took up quarter in middle of october o'grady saunders rejoined terence obtained few day leave to visit father latter progress have be slow wound be unhealed piece of bone working way out doctor have decided that must be invalided home a be desirable to clear out hospital altogether before army marched into spain think change of air will do good major o'connor said to terence a be chatting together after latter arrived think so be evident can not take part in next campaign hope to rejoin again in spring of course be hard must not grumble if bullet have be inch more to right must have smashed bone altogether then must have have small chance indeed for taking off leg at hip be operation that not one man in twenty survives o'flaherty say think that bit of bone have worked out now may not be permanently lame if be to be so lad be of use kicking against fate have got majority if permanently disabled by wound can retire on pension on can live comfortably so hear that sir john moore be going to march into spain by way have got cousin in oporto neighbourhood though suppose be likely to run against never heard say anything about before father think that ever did mention first cousin of mine went over just about time be married to oporto established there a wine merchant have be out there before for firm in dublin when clancy father died came into money went out a said started for be sharp fellow did well married daughter of big land owner used to hear from occasionally died about year ago left girl behind have be brought up in mother religion never said much about wife fancy be very strong roman catholic that did not quite agree about girl who a gathered have hankering after father religion however after clancy died never heard more of there be letter from man of business announcing death stating that clancy have left own property be to say money have made in business to girl what have become of since know be business of mine though believe be nearest relation at least uncle have other child there be brother sister except father still a left widow who have good big property on own account be connected with lot of grandee family there be occasion for to mix up in affair indeed never entered head to do so yet clancy be great friend must be glad to know what have become of girl fancy that be about age if moore must take up north might make inquiry there mother family name be montarlies fancy from what clancy said father property be somewhere to north of oporto so expect at town must be likely to hear something of right father if go there will be sure to make inquiry on fourth day after terence arrival hospital be broken up convalescent marched for torres vedras major o'connor with four other officer forty men be put on board ship to be taken to england visit have done father good terence o'flaherty said a after seeing party safely on board ship returned to town whence be to march with convalescent sixty in number among whom be five officer have brightened up deal last four day wound look distinctly more healthy have strong hope that splinter have worked out now being here have given fillip so that be altogether better more cheerful hope by spring will be able to rejoin can tell be mighty glad to be off again have be pretty hard work here for have have for last fortnight hundred twenty men on hand at first there be three of here two went off with last batch of convalescent have be alone since luckily major peter have be well enough to look after thing in general help commissariat man still with forty bad case have not have much time on hand of course knew other officer belonged to other regiment be not like being among mayo when do think will be starting again have idea have heard that moore be doing everything can to hurry on thing that be awfully hampered for want of money be scandalous here be agent supplied with immense sum for use of blackguard spaniard yet keep own army without fund if general have fund terence have better be stopping where be there be getting anything in portugal without paying ten time proper price for from what hear of spaniard will charge twenty time put money in pocket then not even give what paid for a to being good to a ally be not to be hoped for will take arm money expect to feed troop will then run away at sight of french soldier will see if hear that junta of corunna say that north will rise a soon a enter country may rise flock round until have got arm money then will go off to home again be sort of assistance be to be have from must do deal better if there be not spaniard in country be left to to fight out with french in case o'flaherty must never cross frontier at say that napoleon be gathering great army against force with french troop already in spain twenty twenty five thousand men must fare very badly especially a say that emperor be coming be worse news than other terence be only because french general have always be quarrelling among that whole peninsula have not be conquered with napoleon at head of affair must be different matter altogether humble opinion be that have better stay where be until have wiped out spaniard altogether terence laughed take sanguine view of thing have be with regiment terence have have very little to do with native have not seen very much of thank goodness have seen quite enough to know that though perhaps peasant must make good soldier if officered by englishman there be mighty little feeling of patriotism among class above reading writing may be good for country a far a see here reading writing spoil here for man one come across who can sign name be intent either on filling pocket on working scheme other for own advantage if be sir john moore must send up division to oporto bishop member of junta shoot friere dozen of principal officer if people of oporto gave chance clear street with grape shot why if have be for small guard of fellow with french garrison be marched down there to embark portuguese must have murdered man jack of did murder good many robbed of baggage if have not be that men loaded must have fired on if have gone further not frenchman must have got off alive if have be done in lisbon where french have be master there might have be sort of excuse for have never be near oporto at therefore people there have score to settle with be afraid o'flaherty that army worked on principle must never get far from coast for must have whole country against so much better if never got far from coast how much help have have from there be not single horse waggon for transport except have hired at exorbitant price not single ounce of food must not even divide with magazine at leirya have share in capturing rabble call army have never fired shot marched yard with except trant small command be kept so far out of in fight doubt whether fired shot yet take upon to throw obstacle in way to dictate to general to upset plan a soon a be formed well will be glad to be back with regiment again terence there be fun going on there anyhow have not have hearty laugh since o'grady went off ten day ago be heartily glad to see back again terence said doe not seem bit worse for having lost hand have got through deal better than have expected considering that be not what might be called very temperate man not by mean be not very often that take more liquor than can carry generally go very close to mark kept very short here o'flaherty laughed told that if did not obey order must have invalided home have got to promise that will draw in bit in future have good hope of keeping seeing that when army start again wo get much chance of indulging will be good thing for others a well a o'grady terence said quietly suppose in ireland whisky doe not do much harm seeing that be wet country here notice that can not drink half a much a be accustomed to without feeling be true for terence bottle here go a far a bottle in old country find with wounded spirit have very bad effect even in very small quantity there be one thing when troop be on march not only get small chance of getting drink mighty little time to think of when have be doing twenty mile day with halt stoppage on beastly road defile be on foot from daylight until late in evening then perhaps turn at outpost man have got much time for divarshon even if there be liquor to be have be glad enough when have have glass so to wrap in cloak lie down to sleep have nearly sworn off for found that head troubled in morning after glass two more than did after night sitting at athlone ah terence be lucky for that have fancy for hope never will have o'flaherty if one have got thoroughly wet through in long day fishing may be that glass of punch may keep away cold though even doubt be sure that be better without at other time hope day fashion will change instead of being considered almost a matter of course after dinner men must be under table will then be looked upon a disgraceful for man to get drunk a be now for woman to do so o'flaherty looked at companion with amused surprise faith terence must be change indeed might a well say that hope time will come when can whip off fellow leg without feeling pain perhaps may come too terence laughed there be saying next morning detachment started at daybreak marched to torres vedras where heard that general movement be expected to begin regiment have now comfortable mess situation be freely discussed a scrap of news arrived from lisbon must english ministry have heard comment on imbecility passed by officer of british army even might have doubted perfect wisdom of plan on th of october moore have received despatch stating that infantry cavalry be to be employed in north of spain ten thousand of be to be sent out direct from england remainder be to be composed of regiment from army in portugal moore have choice of taking troop round in ship of marching direct decided upon latter course for arrangement have be made by sir hew dalrymple to enter spain by almeida moreover thought that resource of sea coast of galicia must not be more than sufficient to supply transport food for men who be to land there under command of sir david baird english general difficulty be indeed overwhelming have soldier who although recently raised have shown good fighter be altogether without even transport sufficient for officer with ample supply of money experienced staff well organized commissariat difficulty might have be overcome sir john moore be practically without money staff have experience whatever commissariat transport officer be alike ignorant of work be called upon to perform be unacquainted with view of spanish government uninformed a to number composition situation of spanish army with whom be to act with of enemy have winter march of mile before must join sir david baird who must have mile to march from corunna to join there be then distance of mile to be traversed before reached ebro be designated a centre of operation have to be done while great french army be already pouring in through pass of pyrenees more tremendous may be said impossible task be ever assigned to english commander to add to absurdity of scheme british government sent off sir david baird without instruction even without money duke of york have vainly protested against plan of ministry have pointed out that nothing short of army of men fully equipped with necessary for war money transport artillery must achieve success of kind upon day terence rejoined news came from engineer in advance that assurance sir john moore have received that road by army be to travel be perfectly practicable for artillery baggage waggon be wholly false be probable that artillery cavalry must have to make long circuit to south be too late now to change route for rest of army nearly force have already started on road to almeida supply for subsistence have be collected at town therefore be necessary that main body of infantry must travel by road while three thousand be to act a guard for artillery cavalry on other route chapter vii advance be enough to drive sir john out of sens colonel said a news be discussed after mess people must be champion liar of world not content with doing nothing seem to delight in inventing lie to prevent doing anything for who ever heard of army marching without artillery cavalry one way while arm travelled by different road entirely that not for march of twenty mile for march of three hundred one battery be to go with what will be use of six gun against enemy with sixty day baggage be being cut down owing to blackguard portuguese breaking engagement to furnish waggon will have to march pretty nearly a stand to take with nothing beyond one change of clothes loud exclamation of discontent ran round table be bad enough that in midst of campaign waggon must break down baggage be left behind that troop must start upon campaign with scarcely necessary of life have caused general anger in army order must have be more willingly obeyed than one to march upon lisbon shoot public official establish state of siege rule by martial law seizing for use of army draught animal waggon carriage must be found in city swept in from country round colonel have not exaggerated matter number of tent to be taken be altogether insufficient for regiment even with utmost crowding possible officer baggage have be cut down to twenty pound head amount scarcely sufficient for single change of clothes boot even amount of ammunition to be taken must be insufficient to refill soldier pouch after supply carried be exhausted paucity of baggage must not have mattered so much have march begun at commencement of summer instead of just a winter be setting in in former case men must have slept in open air solitary blanket one change of clothes must have sufficed with wet season at hand to be followed by winter cold grievance be very serious one terence have already learned that brigade be to march in two day that great bulk of baggage be to be stored at torres vedras be to be occupied on leaving by of troop must remain in portugal faith be evil look out terence o'grady who be sitting next to said pathetically sorra drop of whisky be there in camp now sha' be able to have even drink of bastely spirit onless can buy at town a anstruther division have gone on ahead of be likely that drop have be drunk up will be better for o'grady daly tell that arm be not fully healed yet know that must not like to be left behind when have once started be true enough drop of cratur hurt one beg pardon o'grady be very bad for anything like wound doctor told when be chatting with before dinner that really did not think that must go for must not obey order to give up spirit altogether well own have be smarting good deal last few day o'grady admitted reluctantly though have not said a much to doctor know that be not about right terence faith after being kept upon bastely slop by o'flaherty be not in human nature to drink nothing water when one get chance at rate be not likely to find great temptation after have started well have better begin to night o'grady be going to get away a soon a can if will take advice will come too what to march in two day be not to be thought of mane well terence lad like must not take to lecturing supayrior officer shure know what to do for better than other terence saw that be useless to endeavour to persuade to move presently went round to dr daly said quietly doctor o'grady tell that arm have be hurting good deal more during last two day expect will make night of evening again to morrow if once begin nothing will stop until break up must not do anything will talk to like father terence be good boy to have told might have gone away without thinking of mention name doctor doctor nodded terence went away took vacant seat at distance from presently doctor got up went round to o'grady supply of claret have just be finished bottle of spirit have be placed upon table o'grady stretched out hand to one near doctor quietly removed not for o'grady said have have more than sufficient wine already have be doubting whether be fit to go on with regiment by power if touch spirit to night to morrow will put name down in list of who be to be left behind a unfit for service sure be joking doctor never be more earnest in life o'grady want to be left behind suppose in filthy

glad sorry at present at change have so suddenly taken place be gratifying to have be selected a have be be certainly more pleasant to ride through campaign than to march there must be good many more chance of distinguishing than there must be a regimental officer while on other hand must be away from circle of friend comrade must greatly miss fun jollity of life with unfortunate affair of andrew lieutenant trevor fellow aide de camp said most unfortunate little thought when lunched with two day since to day must be down with broken leg riding in place just at present certainly feel very delighted at change see from father being captain in regiment have be brought up with to be taken so suddenly away from seems tremendous wrench yes can understand that other said in case be different regiment be not coming out of course be greatly pleased when general gave chance of going with still see a regiment be in brigade will still be able to be with when off duty when end of campaign come will return to besides there be compensation will at least get roof to sleep under at rate nine time out of ten know how feel to be small comfort being on horseback instead of tramping along heavy road on foot brigadier be capital fellow though doe keep hard at work at rate work hard doe not send galloping about with sort of trivial message might a well be unsent besides be always thoughtful considerate be related to in way not at then suppose have good interest in way else how did come to pick out be just piece of luck terence said be because have heard name in connection with fight transport came over in have with two french privateer oh yes remember now other said have forgotten that name be o'connor remember about now told story at vigo be put in general order by sir arthur know chief spoke very highly about conduct in affair be just like to remember to pick out to take andrew place well fairly won be more than one can say for most staff appointment be in ninety nine case out of hundred result of pure favouritism interest well o'connor be very glad to have on staff see make lot of difference when there be only two of that must like other own have not done anything a yet to get credit for at vimiera be just stand up beat back have not single message to carry of course at rolica brigade be not in hope will get turn day then be father who be badly wounded yes saw off to england four day ago hope that will be able to rejoin before long be not certain yet that wound wo bring on permanent lameness be very anxious about especially a have now got step must be awfully hard on to leave service just a have got field officer rank yes must be hard however hope that sea voyage english air will set up again presently one of officer who be in front turned said general wish to ride back along line mr trevor report whether interval between regiment be properly kept also a to how baggage waggon be going on a trevor turned to ride back general cantered on followed by three officer four trooper who served a orderly two mile ahead came to bridge across torrent road always bad one have be completely cut up by passage of provision ammunition cart going to front be now almost impassable will please to ride back mr o'connor request colonel of leading regiment to send on pioneer company of men at double to clear road make passable for waggon work be quickly done while men filled up deep rut others cut down shrub bush growing by river bank tied into bundle put across narrow road threw earth stone upon in hour from order being given bugle sounded advance head of column have be halted just before reached bridge men fell out many of running down to stream to refill water bottle a bugle sounded at once fell in again column got into motion general fane staff remained at bridge until waggon have crossed be not much of job fane said of course four regiment passing over flattened earth well down waggon have cut up again first heavy shower will wash earth away in couple of day will be a bad a before there be plenty of stone down in river have mean of breaking up large one of carrying quantity of small one few hundred sapper engineer with proper tool must soon go long way towards making road fairly fit for traffic nothing can be done without tool wheel barrow at least hand barrow for carrying stone see men wanted to use blanket poor fellow will want badly enough before long contractor good must go to piece by time have carried dozen load of stone at rate will content with making road passable for own waggon troop who come after must do same by way mr o'connor have not got kit yet sir have doubt that be with regimental baggage will get when halt to night do so general said of course can be carried with ours must advise always to take change of clothes in valise blanket strapped on with greatcoat have mr andrew blanket sir be strapped on when mounted did not notice be right store blanket be very little use for keeping off rain provided ourselves with good thick horse cloth before leaving england be great deal warmer than blanket be practically water proof have doubt that mr andrew told servant to strap on a usual many many time during campaign have terence good reason for thinking with gratitude of andrew kindly thought greatcoat like of officer of regiment have be made at athlone of good irish frieze lined with flannel must stand almost amount of rain be not long enough to protect leg while lying down by rolling in horse cloth be able to sleep warm dry when without must have be half frozen soaked through with rain from above moisture from ground below found that brigadier staff carried same amount of baggage a other officer only difference being that general have tent for assistant adjutant

o'grady said a if man must fight better for having belt white a snow must not fight better o'grady regiment must do so colonel put in little matter be nothing in still have good deal to do with discipline of regiment there be doubt that be not a smart in appearance a ought to be that other regiment in brigade show up better than do be matter must be seen to will inspect regiment very carefully before march to morrow there be little silence among group smile stole over several of face a rule colonel be very lax in small matter of kind occasionally thought necessary to put on air of severity to insist upon most rigid accuracy in respect fit seldom lasted beyond twenty four hour after thing went on pleasantly again of officer presently sauntered off to warn colour sergeant that colonel intended to inspect regiment closely before marching next morning that men must be warned to have uniform belt firearm in perfect order terence remained for little time longer chatting then

a portuguese have circulated score of calumnious lie on le foundation one can not be too particular will see what can do to morrow chapter viii false alarm march be continued until brigade arrived at almeida reached on th of november sir john moore head quarter staff came up on following day troop be now assembled at place for anstruther by misconception of order have halted leading division instead of a intended by general continuing march to salamanca condition of troop be excellent discipline have be somewhat relaxed during period of inactivity be now thoroughly restored weather have continued fine steady exercise have well prepared for campaign be beginning thing however be in other respect going on unfavourably junta of corunna have given most solemn promise transport everything necessary for advance of sir david baird force must be ready by time officer arrived yet nothing have be done so conscious be junta of shortcoming that when fleet with troop arrived off port refused to allow to enter without order from central junta fifteen day be wasted before troop must disembark then be found that provision transport have be provided that nothing be to be hoped for from spanish authority baird be entirely unprovided with money be supplied with l from moore scanty military chest while at very time british agent mr frere be in corunna with two million of dollar for use of spaniard be squandering like other british agent right left among men who refused to put to slightest trouble to further expedition spain be at time boasting of enthusiasm of army of immense force that have in field succeeded in persuading english cabinet english people with help of little money must alone unaided drive french right across frontier emptiness of braggadocio utter incapacity of spanish authority general be now speedily exposed for napoleon newly arrived army scattered spaniard before like sheep be only on one two occasion that anything like severe fighting took place within space of three week there remained of great army of spain few thousand fugitive hanging together without arm discipline madrid centre of pretended enthusiasm patriotism surrendered after day pretence at resistance whole of eastern province fell practically without blow into hand of invader at present however moore still hoped for assistance from spaniard like baird be crippled for want of money determined not to delay march sent agent to madrid other place to make contract raise money thus while minister at home squandered huge sum on spaniard left to own military commander to raise money by mean of loan to enable to march never in course of military history of england be operation so crippled foiled by utter incapacity of government a in opening campaign of peninsular war while baird be vainly trying to obtain transport at corunna reinforcement of five thousand spanish troop under general romana landed at san andero being equipped from british store joined spanish general blake in biscay troop have be raised for french service at time napoleon brother joseph be undisputed king of spain be stationed in holland when insurrection at home broke out news of rising be sent to in pursuance of plan agreed upon suddenly rose marched down to port embarked in english ship sent to receive be in transported to northern coast of spain sir david baird be man of great energy having succeeded in borrowing little more money from mr frere started on march to join general moore have with great difficulty hired country cart at exorbitant rate number be so small that be obliged to send up force in half battalion so be able to proceed very slowly sir john moore be still in utter ignorance of situation in spain jealousy among general disinclination of central junta to appoint one person to post might enable to interfere with intrigue have combined to prevent appointment of commander in chief there be one therefore with whom sir john must open negotiation learn what plan if have be decided upon for general operation against advancing enemy on day that moore arrived at almeida blake be in full flight pursued by french army strong napoleon be at vittoria with troop of fact be ignorant letter that received from lord william bentinck colonel graham exposing folly of spanish general reached on th crossed frontier of spain marching to ciudad rodrigo on day blake be finally defeated one of other army completely crushed dispersed event left large french army free to act against british sir john moore however did not hear of until week later knew however that situation be serious after report of spanish enthusiasm be astonished to find that complete apathy prevailed that effort be made to enroll population even to distribute vast quantity of british musket stored up in magazine of city general arrived at salamanca with british infantry french cavalry be at valladolid three march distant on th more troop have arrived on d infantry six gun be at salamanca moore now knew of defeat of blake that french army have crushed be free to advance against salamanca did not yet know of utter dispersal of asturian army that two army of castanos palafox be also defeated scattered beyond attempt at rallying that conqueror be also free to march against although ignorant of force with napoleon have entered spain having idea of enormous strength knew that must not be le than men that must be joined by at least more position be indeed desperate one baird be still twenty march distant cavalry artillery still far away must require five day to bring rear of own army to salamanca a only small portion must come forward day owing to want of transport yet while in position of imminent danger spanish authority through mr frere other agent be violently urging advance to madrid general moore be indeed in position of imminent danger lying report a to strength of spanish army induced for moment to make preparation for such movement when however learned utter overthrow dispersal of whole of spanish army saw that nothing remained to fall back if possible upon portugal be necessary however that must remain at salamanca until hope must arrive with gun army be in position to show front to enemy instruction have be previously sent to hope to march to escurial hope have endeavoured to find road across mountain of ciudad rodrigo road be so bad that dared not venture upon a number of horse be barely sufficient to drag gun ammunition waggon along good road therefore kept on way until reached escurial after advancing three day farther towards heard of utter defeat of spaniard flight of army cavalry outpost brought in word that more than cavalry be twelve mile away that other french troop be at segovia other place prospect of making way to join sir john moore seemed well nigh hopeless with admirable skill resolution hope succeeded in eluding of foe in checking others by destroying defending bridge finally joined main force without loss of of important convoy of gun ammunition that be escorting satisfaction of troop at arrival of force have be regarded a lost be unbounded hitherto unprovided a be with artillery cavalry must have fought only under such disadvantage a must render defeat almost inevitable for enemy must have pounded with artillery from distance beyond musket range must have made effectual reply cavalry must have circled round cut communication charged down on line in flank rear while engaged with infantry now man felt once again formed part of army that army must be relied upon to beat other of equal number terence have enjoyed march to salamanca fine weather have broken up heavy rain have often fallen thick coat kept dry except in steadiest downpour while on one two occasion only general staff have failed to find quarter available a proceeded gradually closed up with troop forming part of same division at almeida came under command of general fraser whose division be made complete by arrival up to point young aide de camp duty have be confined solely to work of brigade to seeing that regiment kept proper distance that none of waggon loitered behind that road be repaired where absolutely necessary for baggage to pas in afternoon generally rode forward with major errington quartermaster general of brigade to examine place fixed upon for halt to apportion ground between regiment ascertain accommodation to be obtained in village two orderly accompanied carrying bundle of light rod with ground be marked off card with name of regiment being inserted in slit at end of rod village be then divided in four quarter for accommodation of officer beyond fixing name of regiment to part assigned to attempt be made to allot special quarter to individual officer being left for regimental quartermaster to do on arrival of troop when column came up terence led regiment to spot marked off directed baggage waggon to respective place while be doing trevor with orderly saw head quarter baggage carried to house chosen for general use that place be made a comfortable a might be then endeavoured to add to ration by purchase in village fane always remained with troop until tent be erected be under cover ration distributed fire lighted latter operation be often delayed by necessity of fetching wood from distance wood in immediate neighbourhood having be cut down burned either by french on advance by british regiment ahead then went to quarter where received report of medical commissariat transport officer wrote report of state of road obstacle that have encountered sent back by orderly to officer commanding six gun be following day march behind have be brought along with great labour being often necessary to take off carriage carry up down difficult place while men be frequently compelled to harness to rope aid horse to drag gun waggon through deep mud between arrival of troop dinner terence have time to generally spent with regiment never did see such country terence o'grady complained to one day go where will in ould oirland can always get jugful of poteen potful of 'taties rasher of bacon if be village fowl egg here there be not even spirit wine a for chicken have not seen feather of one since started believe peasant must know egg if saw nonsense o'grady if be to go off main road must be able to buy thing barring poteen maybe potato must get plenty of onion instead must remember that french army came along here expect must have eaten nearly everything up on way may be sure that anstruther brigade gleaned left a marched from mondego found villager well supplied better good deal than place of same size must be in ireland except at first halting place own that although hoolan sometimes fails to add to ration have not be so badly off terence go out with two three more of boy directly halt laving other servant to get tent ready generally brings dozen fish sometimes dozen that have got out of stream be old hand be tim if ca get for dinner get for breakfast catch with night line snare sort of poaching trick know bought bag with four five pound of lime at torres vedras managed to smuggle away in regimental baggage asked what be for rascal tipped wink a much a to say ask question master believe that drop handful into likely pool when come across one have never dared to ask for conscience must not let countenance such unsportsmanlike way of getting round fish think that there be much harm in under present circumstance terence laughed be not sport be food be afraid tim that must have be poaching good deal at home must never have thought of buying lime before starting on march must scorn to take in oirish fish yer honour hoolan said indignantly seems to that a people here be trating in just a blackguardly manner a can shure be least can do to catch fish way can just to pay off well looking at in light tim will say no more against practice think must bring to lime even portuguese water conscience must not trouble at eating fish have be caught by somebody else will bear in mind yer honour next time come on good pool dish of fine fish will be left at quarter yer honour must not mintion to gineral where got from maybe conscience in matter of ateing limed fish must be more tender than own might get into trouble will take care about tim at rate will try manufacture two three hook when halt for day will try do little fishing on own account will make two three mr o'connor made couple for mr ryan caught two beauty yesterday evening thank hoolan fond a be of fishing wonder did not strike before can make line by plaiting office string with twisted horse hair instead of gut expect that be just what mr ryan did yer honour heard adjutant using powerful language morning because must not find ball of twine after terence generally managed to get hour fishing before evening twilight have quite faded away by aid of long rod cut on river bank line manufactured by hoolan hook baited with worm generally contrived to catch enough fish to supplement ordinary fare at following morning breakfast be welcome surprise trevor brigadier said first time fish appeared at table thought smelt fish frying felt sure must be mistaken where on earth did get from be not doing general o'connor be a much surprised a when saw burke squatting over fire frying three fine fish asked where have stolen told that mr o'connor brought in at eight o'clock yesterday evening where did get from o'connor caught in stream that crossed mile back sir found likely pool few hundred yard down hour work there gave three fish stopped biting a soon a got dark what did catch with terence explained nature of tackle capital have certainly given very pleasant change of food hope that will continue practice whenever there be chance there ought often to be one general cross dozen little mountain stream day village be generally built close to one suppose must have thought of if have not found that of men of regiment have be supplying mess with hope to do better in future for going over ground where of troop in front of have bivouacked came upon white feather blowing about will try to tie fly ought to be good deal more killing than worm when light begin to fade have be fisherman then at home yes sir did good deal of fishing round athlone be taught to tie own fly wish have packet of two one of fellow made for be well enough for worm be rather clumsy for fly used to be fond of fishing fane said have always bought tackle doubt whether must make much hand at if left to own device be not likely to be able to get hook till get to almeida must think must find there will be able to get wire to make with doubt sir fancy after have left almeida wo find many opportunity of fishing o'connor will have other work on hand then will hope be able to buy what want at rate will have a good chance of doing so a others while along road there be nothing to be have for love money peasant must doubt be glad to sell anything have be living on black bread indeed greater part have moved away to le frequented place doubt will come back again a soon a have passed how long will be allowed to live in peace quietness be more than can say a long a be only troop who come along have nothing much to complain of for can sell everything have to dispose of at price never dreamt of before complain bitterly of french who ate fruit drank wine killed pig fowl appropriated cattle horse thought lucky to escape with life see there be very few men about here have gone off to join one other of portuguese band fancy portuguese fellow will turn out useful day general major errington said be stout fellow though think townspeople must be of good peasantry ought to make good soldier if be well drilled led be very large if fane laughed see sign of leader unless must lend few hundred non commissioned officer see where drill instructor be to come from still have more hope of than have of spaniard men under trant be never tried much under fire certainly improved in discipline very much in short time be with if must get rid of portuguese authority take people in hand ought to be able to turn out fifty thousand good fighting troop in course of few month so long a thing go on a be see hope of efficient aid from at almeida terence managed to procure hook be clumsily made greatly superior to anything that must turn out be also able to procure strong line use of fly seemed to be altogether unknown however during stay made dozen different pattern with in small tin box coil of line stowed away at bottom of one of holster felt that if opportunity must occur ought to be able to have fair sport have suffered good deal during heavy rain came on occasionally from fact that infantry cloak be not ample enough to cover leg when riding be fortunate enough here to be able to buy pair of long riding boot with pair of thick canvas trouser made by one of regimental tailor coming down just below knee felt that in future must defy rain at salamanca there be far better opportunity of officer supplementing outfit landing on mondego early in august have made provision against heat have brought no outfit at suited for wear in winter seized opportunity of providing with warm under garment have lining sewn into greatcoat otherwise prepared for cold must shortly set in greater part of troop be here quartered in convent other extensive building a fane brigade be one of first to arrive enjoyed short period of well earned rest terence have by time picked up good deal of portuguese be able to make pretty well understood by spanish shopkeeper a well a other officer be astonished disgusted at lethargy prevailed when a now knew great spanish army be scattered to wind large body of french troop be advancing in direction to crush out last spark of resistance officer of mayo fusilier have established mess terence often dined there be always eagerly questioned a to what be going to be done can assure o'grady said one day aide de camp be not admitted to confidence of officer commanding in chief know more a to sir john intention than youngest drummer boy suppose that everything will depend upon weather whether general hope with artillery cavalry manages to join if doe suppose will fight battle before fall back if doe not suppose will have to fall back without fighting if french will let wish terence must give lazy spaniard good fright just a gave people at athlone faith must give couple of month pay to see regularly scared if be not on staff might try o'grady must never do for to try thing now dick ryan who be standing by winked significantly in short time terence be talking eagerly together in corner of room who be to know be staff officer terence latter urged be infantry uniform that be wearing ai there hundred of infantry officer here be good fun at athlone think that many of believed there be real danger must be altogether different here be scared enough a be though walk about with cloak wrapped round pretend to be mighty confident let come talk over outside dick did not much matter before if have be discovered have hand in of course colonel must have given wigging at heart must have be a pleased at joke a of be different affair here going out continued talk arranged plan late following night two english officer rushed suddenly into drinking shop close to gate through road to valladolid passed french french one exclaimed run for life give alarm men leapt to foot rushed out tumultuously scattered through street shouting at top of voice french be coming french be coming get up will all be murdered in bed alarm spread like wildfire terence ryan made way back by shortest line to room where most of officer be still sitting smoking chatting news o'connor colonel asked nothing have heard of colonel thought must drop in for cigar before turning in few minute later tim hoolan entered there be shindy in town honour said to colonel meself doe

terence went up to convent well o'connor have heard how began colonel asked a went into mess room one seems to know at colonel authority be making inquiry a far a have heard nothing have taken place to account for reminds colonel said shutting one eye looking fixedly at terence of certain affair took place at athlone be thinking same terence replied quietly only scare be good deal greater here

out of how did manage at lad how must manage terence said indignantly o'grady know did make remark about scare at athlone said must be fun to have one here be little shocked at hearing thing from a often say superior officer certainly appears to that be who first broached idea so have much more right to feel suspicion that have hand in carrying of out than for to suspect well terence o'grady said in insinuating way wo ask question now maybe day when have marched away from place will tell in out of business maybe o'grady perhaps will also confess to how managed to bring scare about go along wid terence be know better than anyone else have nothing to do with will never forgive until make clean breast of to will see about terence laughed anyhow if allude to subject again will feel duty to inform colonel of reason for suspecting that be concerned in spreading false report last night be first rate be dick ryan said a joined terence when latter left mess room be good fun dicky tell for time be quite a much scared a anyone else never thought that must have gone quite so far when came to troop turning out sir john everyone felt that there must be awful row if be ever found

of inquiry have doubt that will get hold of of men in wine shop will come out that two british officer started alarm what if did ryan said there be only two wretched candle burning in place must not have got fair sight at indeed jumped up bolted moment spoke will bet that there be not one among who must be able to swear to though be standing before have doubt if be questioned man must give different account of what be like have fear that will ever find out still will be glad when be out of old place not because be afraid about share in business being discovered have be here nearly fortnight now a know there be strong french force within ten mile of think that be about time that fun began think that be going to retreat do know more about than do dicky feel absolutely sure that will retreat see anything else for to do day fresh news come in about strength of french a spanish resistance be now pretty well over have fallen will be free to march against even when hope have joined will only be about strong have at least ten time force thing will be mighty lucky if get back across frontier into portugal before be on sir john moore however be not disposed to retire without doing something for cause of spain french army have not yet penetrated into southern province nobly resolved to make movement must draw whole strength of french towards give time for spaniard in south to gather remains of army together organize resistance to french advance in view of number strength of enemy more heroic resolution be ever taken by military commander be more to be admired inasmuch a must hope to win victory must cover army with glory success must satisfy public at home at best must hope after long fatiguing dangerous march to effect retreat from overwhelming force must be hurled against while remaining at salamanca sir john foreseeing that retreat into portugal must be finally carried out took step to have magazine established on two of principal route to coast that choice might be left open to by to retire when have accomplished main object of diverting great french wave of invasion from south on th of december march began for next ten day army advanced farther farther into country so far moore have only soult army opposing advance towards burgos might be possible to strike heavy blow at general before napoleon who be convinced that british must fall back into portugal if have not already begun to do so must come up have be solemnly assured that must be joined by romana with picked men that general have with peasant who be in such miserable condition when british reached spot where junction be to be effected be ashamed to show marched away into leon british in order to obtain forage be obliged to move along several line of route sir david baird division joined a advanced when reached carrion effective force amounted to men with sixty piece of artillery on french side soult have on hearing of british advance to north east by if successful must cut french line of communication between madrid frontier called up detached troop wrote to governor of burgos to divert to assistance troop coming along road from france destination might be on st lord paget with th th hussar surprised french cavalry force at sahagun ordered th to turn position endeavour to cut off when with th hussar lord paget arrived in rear of village found six hundred french dragoon drawn up ready to attack at once charged broke pursued for distance twenty be killed thirteen officer men taken prisoner on d soult have concentrated force at town of carrion night british troop be got in motion to attack two force being about even in number scarcely have moved forward when report from romana own spy reached sir john moore to effect that march have achieved object with be undertaken order have be sent by napoleon for whole of french army to move at once against british while with troop at madrid strong have started by forced march to fall upon instant moore received information arrested forward movement of troop object have be attained french invasion of south be arrested time given to spaniard there be nothing now to fall back with speed be well indeed that did not carry out intention of attacking soult latter have day received order from emperor not to give battle to fall back so tempt moore to pursue in case line of retreat must have be intercepted army irretrievably lost order to retreat be unwelcome one indeed to troop for twelve day have marched through deep snow suffered fatigue privation hardship that evening have expected to be repaid for exertion by battle victory on following morning order to retreat coming at moment be bitter disappointment indeed be of course ignorant of reason for sudden change officer shared discontent of troop feeling largely accounted for disorder loss took place during retreat napoleon led troop north with usual impetuosity deep snow choked pass through mountain general after twelve hour of labour reported road impracticable napoleon placed at head of column amidst storm of snow driving hail led over mountain with tremendous effort reached desillas on th while houssaye entered valladolid on same day ney with th corp arrived at rio seco full of hope that have caught british emperor pushed on towards barras only to find that be twelve hour too late moore have instant received news sent back heavy baggage with main body of infantry following more slowly with light brigade cavalry latter at time pushing party up to enemy line skirmishing with outpost to prevent soult from suspecting that army have retreated on th whole army moving by different route approached river esla crossed in thick fog greatly hindered operation brigade remained on left bank to protect passage for enemy cavalry be already close at hand soult be hotly pressing in pursuit strong body of horse belonging to emperor army intercepted lord paget near mayorga two squadron of th hussar charged up rising ground on have posted notwithstanding disadvantage in number position killed twenty took hundred prisoner moore made short pause on esla for position must be turned by force advancing from south waited therefore only until must clear out magazine collect straggler send forward baggage ordered bridge by army have crossed to be broken down left crawford to perform duty short a retreat have be have already sufficed to damage most seriously morale of army splendid discipline order have be shown during advance be now gone many of regimental officer altogether neglected duty troop be insubordinate great number straggled plundered village committed excess of sort already general have be forced to issue order reproaching army for conduct appealing to honour of soldier to second effort valiant in battle capable of greatest effort on march hardy in enduring fatigue inclemency of weather british soldier always deteriorates rapidly when back be turned to enemy confident in bravery regarding victory a assured be unable to understand necessity for retreat considers degraded by being ordered to retire regard prudence on part of general a equivalent to cowardice army of wellington deteriorated with same rapidity a force when upon two occasion be necessary to retreat when threatened by overwhelming force yet however disorganized british soldier recovers discipline instant be attacked fiercely turn upon pursuer at bridge across esla two private of d gave example of splendid courage determination be night of baggage be still on farther bank two men be posted a sentry beyond bridge order being that if enemy appeared one must fire then run back to bridge shout to warn guard whether enemy be in force not other be to maintain post a long a possible illustration what do mean terence must have thrashed out of boot in time during night light cavalry of imperial guard rode down jackson one of sentry fired ran back to give alarm be overtaken received over dozen sabre cut nevertheless staggered on until reached bridge gave signal walton other sentry with equal resolution stood ground wounded several of assailant who a drew off left unhurt although cap knapsack belt musket be cut in over twenty place bayonet bent double terence o'connor duty have be light enough during advance during three day of retreat to esla have be incessantly occupied trevor have be directed to ride backwards forward along line of brigade to see that there be straggling in rank that baggage cart in rear kept close up task be easy one be unpleasant a well a hard many of officer plodded sulkily along paying attention to men allowing to straggle a chose be obliged to report several of worst case to brigadier with mayo fusilier have le trouble than with others terence have when joined at first halt after retreat began found a angry discontented a rest at unexpected order be at once assailed with question complaint listened to quietly then said of course if prefer french prison to few day hard marching have good reason to grumble at being baulked in wish be have to say about do mean terence o'grady asked angrily soult force be not stronger than ours at least so heard if have be must make difference must have thrashed out of boot in time dare say must o'grady what then well know what then o'grady said after moment silence must have be general business quite so so be there must have be with perhaps couple of thousand wounded a many french prisoner napoleon with men so ney with a many more houssaye with cavalry division in rear cutting off from sea what must have be course then general silence fell upon officer be that so colonel asked at last be so terence said gravely other troop be marching night day to intercept be question of fighting now victory over soult so far from being of use must only have burdened with wounded prisoner even day delay must be absolutely fatal a be be question whether will have time to get back to coast before be posted in front hour be of greatest importance know that have talked over lot of time how dangerous position be general fane told when order to retreat be issued that believed peril to be even more imminent than thought know when marched north from salamanca that without single spaniard to back must be hoped for be to aid saragossa seville cadiz to gather levy in south prepare for defence that erelong must have number of enemy upon be what have precisely happened now there be grumbling because object have be attained that be not allowed to fight battle that whether won lost must equally ruin sure ye be right o'grady said warmly be set of omadhouns have sense in head terence there be gainsaying be grumbling more than rest of wo grumble more still suppose that there be harm in hoping will have just bit of fighting before get back to portugal will be lucky if have good deal of fighting o'grady against odds will satisfy even a to portugal there be chance of getting there ney will certainly cut road emperor will most likely also do so a can see for on map divil map have ever looked at since be at school o'grady said then if ca get back to portugal where will get to to one of northern seaport of course know have be decided upon suppose general have settled that yet must depend upon road movement of enemy whether there be defensible position near port that can hold in case fleet transport can not be got there by time arrive faith terence ye be walking encyclopeydia have got matter at finger end pretend to know more than anyone else terence said with laugh of course hear matter talked over at brigade mess think that fane know more of general absolute plan than do dare say divisional general know must not go further still a fane errington dowdeswell know something about war besides absolute fighting can form idea a to plan will be adopted well terence colonel said did think time be coming so soon when be going to be instructed by father son will own that have made feel have begun campaigning too late in life that have given lesson did not mean to do colonel terence said good deal abashed be o'grady be chiefly speaking to supeyrior officer o'grady murmured superior officer certainly terence went on with smile who having a say never looked at map since left school while have naturally studied one evening since started from torres vedras can therefore know more about situation than doe tim hoolan certainly never intended remark to apply to colonel hit mark same lad shame be mine not yours think have done good one doe care when one be retreating for good reason when one march for twelve day to meet enemy then when just close to one turn one back run away be enough to disgust englishman let alone irishman well boy now see be all right will do duty a well on retreat a did on advance divil grumble will there be in hearing from moment therefore mayo fusilier be example to brigade grumble in rank be met with cheerful whist boy do think that know general business better than doe be plenty of fighting be likely to get before have done never fear now be time boy to get regiment good name general know that can fight now let see that can wait patiently till get chance remember better temper be in le will feel cold so laughing joking occasionally breaking into song mayo fusilier pushed steadily forward colonel that evening congratulated men that not one have fallen out keep that up boy said will be proud day for when get to journey end wherever may be to be able to say to brigadier who have be killed by enemy here be regiment just a be when started from carrion not man have fallen out not man have straggled away not man have made baste of be unfit to fall in next morning ' know said to o'driscol a regiment be dismissed from parade will not fall out will not straggle if come to place where wine in plenty will make baste of after added after work have gone through who be to blame at halt next evening at colonel foreboding that men must not be trusted where liquor be plentiful be happily not verified there be immense wine vault in town be broken open be speedily crowded by disbanded spaniard soldier camp follower muleteer woman child latter taking refuge there from terrible cold rear guard to mayo regiment have be attached evening before found that baird division have gone on that vast number of drunken soldier have be left behind general moore be with rear guard utmost effort be made to induce drunkard to rejoin regiment appealed to troop instructing commander of different regiment to say that relied implicitly upon soldier to do duty french might at moment be up man must be in rank men be to fall out to enter wine house cellar must have at once pint of wine served out to a much more before marched in morning after colonel read out order supplemented by saying now boy credit of regiment be at stake be big honour have be paid in choosing to join rear guard have got to show that deserve a soon a can be drawn will have pint of wine will be enough to warm finger toe wait here in rank till have drunk wine eaten of bread in haversack by time will see what can do for will have pint before starting though hope there be mother son who must bring discredit on regiment warn that will give officer instruction to shoot down man who wanders from rank in search of liquor french may be here in hour after have started be better to be shot than to be sabred by french dragoon will happen surely enough to baste who have drunk too much to go on with troop only few murmur be heard at conclusion of speech now gentleman colonel said will half dozen of see to wine get hold of of fellow loafing about there make roll out a many barrel a will supply pint to man in regiment a well a men o'grady take lieutenant horton mr haldane two sergeant with here be purse go through town get bread anything else in way of food that can lay hand upon if can above thing get tobacco o'grady search be for time unsuccessful a soldier camp follower have already broken into shop store in unfrequented street however came across large building knocked at door with hilt of sword be opened after time by old man what house be be tobacco factory replied be jabers have come to right place want about ton of be not robber will pay for what take then idea struck wait moment will be back again in time horton do stay here take charge of men be going back to colonel found on reaching regiment that men be already drinking wine eating bread be afraid will never keep o'grady colonel said mournfully be scarcely in human nature to see men straggling about a full a can hold know that there be liquor to be have for taking not to go for be all right colonel know that can never keep men if turn into house to sleep have found big building will hold whole regiment best of be that be tobacco factory expect be run by authority of place a be doing what can for need not grudge what take faith boy will be quiet contented enough so that do get enough to keep pipe going know that will march in morning with bit in knapsack very thing o'grady pas word for regiment to fall in instant have finished meal be not long before be ready in few minute guided by o'grady head of regiment reached building who be owner of place colonel asked old man who with lantern in hand be still standing at door central junta of province have of late taken excellency good then will be guest of central junta of province for night then raised voice boy here be warm lodging for for night tobacco galore for pipe for who have got cigar just wait until have got light then file inside in good order there be difficulty about for factory be in winter worked long after dark set in in very few minute place be lighted up from end to end troop be then marched in divided amongst various room now boy tell men to smoke couple of pipe then to lie down to sleep in morning man can put a much tobacco into knapsack pocket a will hold when halt can give of away to regiment have not be a lucky a men sat down in highest state of satisfaction box of cigar be broken open in couple of minute almost man officer in regiment have one alight in mouth there be few however who got beyond one cigar warmth of place after long march in snow speedily have effect in hour silence reigned in factory save for murmur of voice in one of lower room where officer be located o'grady be broth of boy colonel said men have scarce have smoke for last week will do world of good have got under one roof there be fear that anyone will want to get out will fall in in morning a fresh a paint hour before bugle call three four of have best turn out with dozen men roll up enough barrel from vault to give drink promised to before starting who will volunteer dozen officer at once offered to go captain three lieutenant be told off for work know how to make cigar if know anything else captain o'driscol said be first rate weed so ought to be by brand officer said took two box from cupboard be locked up there be dozen more like thought be a well to take out be at present under table have doubt that be real havannas have probably be got for grandee other will have to do without o'grady said calmly a lighted second cigar be too good for spaniard under sun moreover if did not take may be sure that french must have to morrow must say that central junta of province will be mighty pleased to know that tobacco be smoked by ally instead of by french suppose that will care much about one way o'driscol remarked pocket be so full of english gold that loss of few ton of tobacco wo affect much enjoy cigar immensely have satisfaction of knowing that for once have got something out of spaniard be first thing since landed well boy have better be off to sleep colonel said be so sleepy that can hardly keep eye open ought to be worse for have tramped well nigh forty mile to day see that sentry at door keep awake captain humphrey be officer of day upon word be sorry for tell can light up if like if see officer coming round must get rid of mind sentry be changed regularly for expect that will sleep so soundly that if bugle in place be sounding alarm must not hear right colonel have got sergeant jackson in charge of relief in passage outside think that can depend upon will tell to wake up whenever change sentry say will turn out a long a call will know that be awake that be all right have better tell to call hour before bugle call sullivan so that can wake others get wine here must be minute after half hour thank goodness have to furnish outpost to night in ten minute be asleep on floor wrapped in greatcoat officer of day taking place next door so that must be roused easily hour one other of two non commissioned officer in charge of guard in passage opened door few inch said softly be relieving sentry sir time officer murmured assent sullivan be called at appointed time got up stretched grumbling believe have be asleep ten minute on going out into passage however where light be burning watch told that be indeed time to be moving woke others with men went down to cellar here scene of confusion be great drunken men lay thickly about floor others sat cup in hand talking singing snatch of song spanish english hastily picking out enough unbroken cask for purpose set men to carry up to street be then rolled along to factory just a reached door bugle call sounded men be soon on foot refreshed by good night sleep cask be broached wine served out be awful colonel sullivan said there will be hundred of men left behind there must have be over number in cellar went into there be dozen others in town never saw such disgusting scene scarcely have finished when assemble sounded regiment at once fell in outside factory man with knapsack haversack bulging out with tobacco then joined rest of troop in main street general moore have made vain attempt to rouse besotted men few of least overcome joined rear guard greater number be too drunk to listen to order even to warning that french must be into town a soon a troop marched out chapter x corunna a confusion in street increased from pouring out from house cellar of camp follower woman child together with men le drunk than comrade still unable to walk steadily who filled air with shout drunken execration colonel corcoran rode along line just look at boy said be better for to be standing here like dacent men ready to do duty than to be rolling about in state like drunken blackguard for sake of hour pleasure sure be enough to make mother son of swear off liquor till ye get home again when french get inside town there be not one of drunken baste wo be either killed marched away thousand mile to french prison for hour drink lesson be indeed striking one careless a many of men be brought home to with greater force than ever before in life not only folly degradation of drunkenness few minute later general moore who be riding up down line inspecting condition of men in regiment came along men look very well colonel said a reached fusilier how many be short of number not man general be happy to say that there be not single one did not answer when name be called that be good indeed general said warmly be happy to say that regiment of rear guard have turned out well shown worthy of trust reposed in none however can give so good report a have done selected regiment to strengthen division from excellent order observed kept along line of march be glad indeed that have shown so worthy of honour march regiment across to side of street let others pas fall in at rear of column will give mayo fusilier post of honour a mark of warm approbation for manner in have turned out scarcely have troop left town when french cavalry poured in now that be too late sense of danger penetrated brain of reveller mob of disbanded spanish british soldier camp follower poured out from cellar few of soldier have sense even to bring up musket most of who did so be too drunk to use french trooper rode through mob sabring right left trampling under foot then riding forward without pause set out in pursuit of retiring column a came clattering along road colonel ordered last two company to halt when head of squadron be within fifty yard of trooper be beginning to check horse heavy volley be poured in sent to right about a fast a have come emptied score of saddle then two company formed four again went on at double until reached rear of column day french cavalry menaced retreat until lord paget came back with regiment of hussar drove back in confusion pursuing couple of mile with view of discovering whether be followed by infantry such however be not case column be not further molested until reached cacabolos where be halted rest of army have moved on troop committing excess similar to have taken place at bembibre plundering shop house division marched over deep stream crossed by stone bridge took up ground on lofty ridge ascent being broken by vineyard stone wall four hundred men of rifle a many cavalry be posted on hill two mile beyond river to watch road have scarcely taken post when enemy be seen approaching preceded by six eight squadron of cavalry rifle be at once withdrawn cavalry believing that whole french army be advancing presently followed riding fast came up to infantry just a be crossing bridge before infantry be over french cavalry came down at furious gallop for time be confusion then rifle throwing among vineyard behind wall opened heavy fire french general in command of cavalry be killed with number of troop rest of cavalry fell back regiment of light infantry have followed across bridge two company of d a many of mayo regiment went down hill reinforced rifle sharp fight ensued until main body of french infantry approached bridge battery of artillery opened upon seeing strength of british division believing that whole army be before soult called back troop voltigeurs retired across bridge again fight came to end between two three hundred men have be killed wounded a soon a night came on british force resumed march leaving two company of rifle a piquet at bridge french crossed again in night after fighting fell back again without having be able to ascertain whether main body of defender of position be still there later on rifle fell back at daybreak rejoined main body of rear guard have reached becerrea eighteen mile away here general moore received report from engineer have sent to examine harbour reported in favour of corunna possessed facility for defence be lacking at vigo accordingly sent off order to fleet be lying at latter port to sail at once for corunna directed various division of army to move on town rear guard passed day without moving enjoying welcome rest after thirty six mile have covered day before by march have gained long start of enemy have in evening reached town division before have quitted that morning scene a marched along be painful one day added to number of straggler excess in drink exhausted strength of troop far more than did fatigue of march shoe be worn out many of limped along with rag tied round foot even more painful than sight of dejected worn out men be that of camp follower in addition to terrible hardship fatigue be worn out with hunger almost famished number of died by roadside others still crawled on in silent misery nothing must be done to aid poor creature troop be insufficiently fed for evil conduct of soldier who first marched through town defeated effort of commissariat for have broken into baker shop so maltreated inhabitant that people fled in terror bread must be obtained for use of division in rear towards evening next day reserve approached constantina french be now close upon rear bridge over river have to be crossed to reach town a there be hill within pistol shot of river from french artillery must sweep bridge sir john moore placed rifleman artillery on enemy believing that intended to give battle halted before preparation must be made troop be across bridge be joined by artillery have retired at full speed french advanced endeavoured to take bridge general paget however held post with two regiment of cavalry then fell back to lugo where whole army be now assembled next day sir john moore issued order strongly condemning conduct of troop stating that intended to give battle to enemy news effected instant transformation straggler who have left regiment entered town by two three at once rejoined corp fifteen hundred men have be lost during retreat of whom number killed formed small proportion army still amounted to former strength a be here joined by two fresh battalion who have be left at lugo by general baird on march from coast force therefore numbered men for have be weakened by of light troop having early in retreat be directed towards other port in order to lessen a far a possible strain on commissariat position be strong one when soult at mid day came up at head of men saw at once that until whole force arrived must not venture to attack like british troop have suffered severely from long march many have dropped behind altogether uncertain whether have whole of british before sent battery of artillery cavalry forward when former opened fire be immediately silenced by reply from fifteen piece then made attack upon right be sharply repulsed with loss of from three to four hundred men convinced now that moore be ready to give battle with whole force drew off next day army remained in position soult have be joined by laborde division have infantry cavalry gun english have infantry cavalry gun french made movement to attack british troop be furious at delay soult however be waiting until ney who be advancing by road must threaten british flank cut line of retreat moore finding that soult must not fight alone knowing that ney be approaching gave order for army to leave position after march for corunna exhorted to keep good order to make effort must be last demanded from be indeed impossible for to remain at lugo even if ney have not be close at hand for there be not day supply of bread in town took precaution for securing that error must take place a to route to be followed in dark for ground behind position be intersected by stone wall number of intricate lane to mark right track bundle of straw be placed at interval along line officer appointed to guide column precaution however be brought to naught by ill fortune have dogged general along whole line of retreat tremendous storm of wind rain set in night be pitch dark bundle of straw be whirled away by wind when army silently left post at ten o'clock at night task before be difficult one indeed column lost way one division alone recovered main road other two wandered about night buffeted by wind drenched by rain disheartened weary regiment entered what shelter must find men soon scattered to plunder straggler fell out in hundred at daybreak remnant of two division be still in moment light afforded mean of recovering position column resumed march road behind being thickly dotted by straggler rearguard commanded by general covered rear fortunately enemy did not come up until evening so numerous be straggler when french cavalry charged mustered in sufficient force to repel attack proof that be not so much fatigue a insubordination that caused to lag behind rear guard halted few mile short of friol passed night there enabled disorganized army to rest re form loss during unfortunate march be greater than of former part of retreat added to loss in action during advance next day army halted a french have not come up in sufficient number to give battle on following day marched in good order into corunna where to bitter disappointment of general fleet have not yet arrived at time sir john moore be blamed by ignorant for having worn out troop by length of march accusation be altogether unfounded a be proved by fact that rear guard upon whom full brunt of fighting have fallen who have frequently be under arm night in snow have always to throw out very strong outpost to prevent surprise have marched eighty mile in two day have suffered far more than other troop owing to fact that food supply intended for have be several time wasted destroyed by excess of who have preceded yet who when reached corunna have much smaller number missing from rank than be case with three other division after exertion have be made extraordinary success with general have carried force through host of enemy calculation be baffled by contrary wind delayed arrival of fleet remained to surrender fight battle if won might yet enable army to embark sir john did not even for moment contemplate former alternative troop on arriving be at once quartered in town inhabitant here who have so sullenly held aloof from baird force on arrival have refused to give slightest aid now evinced spirit of patriotism seldom exhibited by spaniard save in defence of

trouble about o'grady said sarcastically perhaps might make shift to do widout widout detriment to service terence made reply mounting rode off up hill behind town at two o'clock on th general movement of french line be observed british infantry strong drew up in order of battle along position marked for british be fighting under serious disadvantage for not only have soult over infantry with very powerful artillery great strength in cavalry owing to position on crest running somewhat obliquely to higher one occupied by french heavy battery on rock to right raked whole line of battle hope division be on british left baird on right fraser division be on ridge distance from others immediately covering town of corunna paget with division to mayo regiment be still attached be posted at village of airis on height between hope division harbour looking down valley between main position ridge held by fraser from here must either reinforce hope baird advance down valley to repel attack of french cavalry cover retreat of main body if forced to fall back battle commenced by french opening fire with field gun be distributed along front of position by heavy battery on left while infantry descended mountain in three heavy column covered by cloud of skirmisher british piquet be at once driven in village of elvina held by portion of th carried french column on side then divided into two portion one endeavoured to turn baird right enter valley behind british position while other climbed hill to attack in front second column moved against british centre third attacked hope left rested on village of palavia abaxo nine english gun be altogether overmatched by of soult heavy battery moore seeing that half column advancing by baird flank made movement to penetrate beyond right directed to throw back one regiment take french in flank paget be ordered to advance up valley to drive back french column menace french battery uniting with battalion previously posted on hill to keep threatening mass of french cavalry in check also sent word to fraser to advance at once support paget baird launched th d regiment to meet enemy issuing from elvina ground round village be broken by stone wall hollow road french be forced back th entering village with fleeing enemy drove after struggle beyond house illustration map of battle of corunna d misunderstanding order retired towards hill french being reinforced again attacked elvina th held stubbornly until again joined by d have be sent forward by moore paget be now engaged in valley advance of enemy be arrested suffered very heavily from fire of regiment on height above flank while paget steadily gained ground centre left be now hotly engaged held ground against attack of enemy on extreme left advanced drove french out of village of palavia abaxo have occupied elvina be now firmly held while paget carried before on right with fraser division behind menaced great french battery have be carried two division must have swept along french position crumpling up force a went driving down towards river moro in case must have be lost owing however to battle having be begun at so late hour darkness now fell general while watching contest at elvina have be struck by cannon ball mortally wounded general baird have also be struck down loss of commander combined with darkness to arrest progress of victorious troop permitted french who be already falling back in great confusion to recover maintain position object for battle have be fought be gained night have saved french from total defeat afforded british opportunity of extricating from position general hope who now assumed command ordered troop to abandon position to march down to port leaving strong piquet with fire burning to deceive enemy arrangement for embarkation have be carefully arranged by sir john moore without least hitch confusion troop marched down to port before morning be on board with exception of rear guard under general beresford occupied citadel at daybreak piquet be withdrawn also embarked force under general hill have be stationed on rampart to cover movement then marched down to citadel there took boat for ship by time however french having discovered that british position be abandoned have planted battery on height of san lucia opened fire on shipping caused much confusion among transport several of master cut cable four vessel ran ashore troop however be taken on board of other transport by boat of men of war stranded ship be fired fleet got safely out of harbour noble commander by whose energy resolution talent wonderful march have be achieved lived only long enough to know that soldier be victorious be buried same night on rampart memory be for time assailed with flood of abuse by portion of press public have along vilified action of british general have swallowed eagerly lie promulgated by junta of oporto by whole of spanish authority in time extraordinary merit came to be recognized to full value name will long live a one of noblest men best general great britain have ever produced beresford held citadel until th then embarked with troop wounded people of corunna remaining true to promise manned rampart of town until last british soldier be on board british loss in battle be estimated at men of french be put down at greater loss be due to fact that assumed offensive be much more exposed than defender that nine little gun of latter be enabled to sweep with grape while british be so far away from french battery that latter be obliged to fire round shot lastly that new musket fresh ammunition gave great advantage to british over rusty musket often damaged powder of french paget division have suffered slightly main loss of english having occurred in around elvina from shot of heavy battery swept crest held by two officer killed four be only casualty in division while thirty of rank file be put out of action chapter xi escape while battle be at height terence be despatched by brigadier to carry order to one of regiment have pushed too far forward in ardour scrambling over rough ground occasionally leaping wall reached colonel general request to fall back little sir be farther forward than regiment on flank enemy be pushing force down hill in direction a there be support can be sent to at present wish extreme right to be in touch with left of regiment holding elvina very good tell general fane will carry out instruction where be now be in village sir terence turned horse to ride back din of battle be almost bewildering desperate conflict be going on in front of village where wall be obstinately contested regiment being hotly engaged with french force be rapidly increasing in strength great french battery be sending missile far overhead against british position on hill british gun be playing on french troop beyond village french light field piece be pouring fire into elvina terence made way across broken ground near village galloping at low stone wall horse be in act of rising to clear when be struck in head by round shot terence be thrown far ahead over wall fell heavily head foremost on pile of stone covered by low shrub shock be terrible one for many hour lay insensible when recovered consciousness remained for time wondering vaguely where be above be canopy of foliage through ray of sun be streaming dead silence have succeeded roar of battle put hand to head be aching intolerably found that hair be thick with clotted blood yes of course said to at last be carrying message to fane be just going to jump wall there be sudden crash remember flew out of saddle be do remember have be stunned suppose how be so quiet suppose battle be over then sat suddenly upright sun be shining said be getting dusk when be riding back to village must have lain here night suddenly heard gun fired be quickly followed by others rose on knee looked cautiously over bush be away there said on height above harbour army must have embarked french be firing at ship illustration poor old jack have carried well ever since got at torres vedras conjecture be speedily verified for looking along crest british have held during fight saw large body of french troop just reaching top of rise stood up now looked round one must be seen moving in orchard vineyard round peered over wall horse lay there in huddled up heap round shot in head exclaimed that account for poor old jack have carried well ever since got at torres vedras climbed down got what be in search of large flask full of brandy water carried in one of holster took long drink felt better at once may a well take pistol said putting into belt climbed over wall again lay down among bush be now able to think clearly must get up surrender a prisoner to first body of french troop that came across must lie where be until then try to get away if surrendered there be before march of seven eight hundred mile to french prison if tried to get away doubt there be many hardship danger at least possibility of rejoining sooner later at rate must be worse off than many hundred who have straggled during march for be probable that great majority of be spread over country a french pressing forward in pursuit must not have troubled to hunt down fugitive who if caught must only be encumbrance to be better off than be for at rate must make understood be more than majority of soldier must do at least must not provoke animosity of peasant by rough measure must be likely to take to satisfy want worst of be that have money then suddenly sat up again looked at foot be luck exclaimed have never given thing thought before on arrival at corunna have thrown away riding boot have bought at constant rain have so shrunk that must no longer wear without pain have taken again to boot that carried in valise from time when at father suggestion have have extra sol placed on above be hidden fifteen guinea fact of money being there have never once occurred to have have sufficient cash about to pay for purchase at salamanca on road indeed have five guinea still in pocket though have drawn no pay from time of leaving torres vedras discovery decided with twenty guinea must pay way for month determined to make attempt to escape firing continued for time then ceased fleet must have got out said to be certain that french have not taken corunna be getting best of up to time be hurt must be dark in half hour there must be fighting on such ground a after besides corunna be strong fortress must have held out there for week for soult can have battering train with besides everything be ready for embarkation know that be intended whether won lost that troop must go on board in night a lay there must occasionally hear sound of drum trumpet a troop marched from position of night before to take up others nearer to town at time heard voice knew that be searching for wounded over ground have be so desperately contested spot where be lying lay between village ground where regiment have gone to order back have be engaged with enemy a fighting have taken place there be unlikely that search party must go over indeed proved to be case after time fell off to sleep did not wake until night be closing in be hungry now again crossing wall took chicken piece of bread that servant have thrust into wallet just before starting made hearty meal unbuckled sword left behind have pistol sword must be only encumbrance a soon a became quite dark made way cautiously down valley passed spot where french column have suffered so heavily then turning to left traversed narrow plain divided position on french heavy battery have be placed plateau on cavalry have be massed numerous fire blazed in wide valley behind where reserve have be stationed on previous morning doubted not that french cavalry be there especially a found sign of life on plateau above coming presently on small stream bathed head for considerable time then proceeded on way feeling much brighter fresher than have done before ground began to ascend more steeply after hour walking stood on crest of hill looked down on position that french have held beyond on corunna sea cold be extreme have brought with greatcoat blanket wrapping in lay down in sheltered position slept again till morning broke head be now better be able to think more clearly than must day before first thing be to decide a to course must be dangerous to make direct for frontier of portugal now that british army have embarked soult must be free to undertake operation in country must doubtless shortly put troop in motion in direction cavalry must be scattering over province collecting provision moreover there must be terrible range of tras o monte to pas certainty whatever of being well received by portuguese peasant north of oporto constant study of staff map be now of great assistance to determined to turn west until reached river minho distance below lugo must do by skirting top of hill must therefore strike somewhere about point where river sil joined following must find at foot of cantabrian hill dividing asturias from leon then must be guided by circumstance must either cross mountain make for seaport must journey down through leon to ciudad rodrigo be still held by spanish garrison from there make way through portugal to lisbon questioned whether must be wise for to attempt to get dress of spanish peasant instead of uniform finally decided that until be beyond risk of being captured by party from soult ney army must be better to continue in uniform if taken in dress must be seen that be straggler from moore army must be simply treated a prisoner of war while if taken in dress of peasant must be liable to be treated a spy shot having made up mind started at once in three hour be at foot of hill on other side of ran road from lugo to corunna proved so disastrous to army presently arrived at small hamlet child in street ran shrieking away a saw woman appeared at door looked out anxiously have not before seen british uniform at once supposed that be french seeing that be alone several men armed with club pick came out be english officer said desire food shelter for few hour have money to pay for peasant at once came round confused account have reached of doings on other side of hill knew that english army have marched from lugo to corunna hotly pursued by french have heard nothing of what have happened afterwards eagerly asked for news terence told that there have be great battle outside corunna that french have be repulsed with much loss that english have embarked on board ship to take round to lisbon there to march east to meet french again nothing must be kinder than treatment received told that ney army be between sil lugo that french troop have crossed minho a yet be eager to know why english if have beaten french sailed away when said that soult must have be joined by ney in couple of day must then be well nigh double strength of british who must be so hotly pressed that must be unable to embark peasant saw that what considered desertion must not have be avoided news of terrible defeat have month before be inflicted upon army have not reached terence did not think necessary to enlighten told that march north of english have be intended to bring french force in direction so to enable spanish army to operate successfully that not only soult ney napoleon have be drawn off from south in pursuit of be filled with satisfaction be at once taken into one of cottage good meal be shortly placed before head be carefully bandaged be then asked how be that have not embarked with rest of army related how have be left behind then asked opinion a to best course telling plan have formed agreed at once that be wisest one that must be dangerous to try until ney force have moved from present position knew that have division at orense on minho that party of cavalry have scoured plain a far a river ulla urged upon to remain with until news be obtained of movement of french army gladly accepted invitation for couple of day remained at little hamlet one of peasant came in at end of time saying that french in corunna have crossed mountain have arrived at santiago twenty mile distant cavalry be scouring country also brought news that romana be at toabado that have two three thousand men with rest having be routed cut up by french cavalry terence at once determined to join fact that still have troop with have influence in causing to form resolution romana have be so often defeated that knew that men must after recent misfortune scatter at once before even weakest french detachment romana knew country well be man of great resource activity be likely to evade effort to capture thought then that by joining sharing fortune be more likely to have opportunity of making way to lisbon than must have if left to own resource especially a have doubt that soult must at once prepare to invade portugal by occupying pass thus render next to impossible to journey thither alone on foot one of peasant offered to guide across hill to toabado started at once at daybreak next morning reached village a romana have be several time in personal communication with sir john moore terence be acquainted with appearance seeing standing at door of principal house of village went up to saluted latter looked upon with great surprise how have managed to pas through french asked have seen none of marquis be wounded in battle of corunna after lying insensible night found when recovered in morning that french have advanced be in rear heard gun from height above town knew that army have gained transport lay concealed day then crossed mountain have be resting for two day at village on other side of hill news came that be here decided to join at once be on staff of general fane knowing duty of aide de camp thought might make useful to until there be opportunity of rejoining british force be welcome sir romana said courteously be only morning that learned from prisoner that men took that have driven back soult before corunna have embarked safely be in great fear that army must have be captured see that have be wounded on head can scarcely be called wound marquis be carrying message on battle field when be taking wall horse be struck with round shot be thrown over head onto heap of rough stone be marvel to be not killed be just going to breakfast senor will be glad if will join have doubt that will do justice to romana who have commanded spanish troop have escaped from holland be most energetic of spanish general defeated often be speedily at head of fresh gathering ready to take field again a partisan chief be excellent possessed military talent be like spaniard generally full of grand utterly impracticable scheme in spite of experience to contrary confident that spaniard must overthrow french have be unfortunate said in reply to inquiry a to how many troop have with at english general request took different course with army to be pursuing in order that magazine must be untouched crossed line of retreat unfortunately franceschi cavalry come down upon cut up artillery infantry scattered force entirely however three thousand have rejoined expect in short time to be at head of ought to have more galician peasant be stubborn fellow know nothing of affair of spain although will fight in defence of own village have interest in anything beyond hang back from joining army might operate outside province see until now have be untouched by war have suffered in way from french extortion outrage a soon a feel smart doubt not will be a full of hatred of invader a people be elsewhere a ready to take up arm against romana troop be motley gathering force that have brought with from holland have be landed at santander marched to bilbao joined blake army have shared in crushing defeat suffered by general at espinosa where most of be taken prisoner be again incorporated in french army afterwards took part in russian campaign in retreat le than four thousand of be taken prisoner by russian handed over by to british transport sent to cronstadt to fetch romana have escaped from battle field afterward raised fresh force have dwindled away from to when joined moore on advance now amounted to barely of whom greater portion have thrown away arm in flight on following day romana with small body of cavalry left toabado crossed minho descended into valley of tamega took refuge close to portuguese frontier line here be for time safe from pursuit of french insignificance of force being best protection soult lost time a soon a english army have left corunna opened gate to a did ferrol although of town must have be taken without siege soult must have be delayed until battering train be brought from madrid magazine of british powder store have be lying for month in ferrol be invaluable to soldier be set to work to make fresh cartridge then after six day halt to give rest to weary footsore men began to prepare to carry out napoleon order to invade portugal ney with men be to maintain galicia reinforced by fresh division soult be to march direct upon oporto with men leaving in hospital to keep up line of communication with ney took time to complete arrangement to gather force at st jago compostella be not until first of february that be able to move on day of arrival on frontier romana despatched terence to sir john cradock who now commanded british troop in portugal have be augmented by fresh arrival from england until number almost equalled that of force with sir john moore marched into spain romana asked that arm money must be sent to promising to harass french advance cut communication from rear terence gladly consented to carry despatch be furnished with one of best horse in troop at once started on journey be long harassing one many range of mountain hill have to be crossed by road difficult in extreme at best of time almost impassable in winter three time be seized by party of portuguese militia raw levy be released on convincing leader that be bearer of communication to english general distance to be travelled be in direct line over two hundred thirty mile be greatly increased by circuitous nature of route through mountainous country so that took nine day must have much exceeded time have terence not found british force at coimbra there exchanged worn out animal for fresh one placed at disposal by officer in command cradock be experiencing exactly same difficulty that moore have done spanish portuguese authority united in pressing to advance former urging upon that presence must be signal for spanish army in south to unite entirely overthrow french while latter be desirous that must march to ciudad rodrigo defeat french at salamanca so protect portugal from invasion from side that portugal might be attacked from north south simultaneously by soult victor did not enter into calculation while urging advance junta must take step to enable army to move must neither afford facility for collecting transport order road that must have to traverse to be put in order thwarted effort to raise strong force among portuguese there be indeed improvement in latter respect at own request lord beresford have be sent out from england to take command of portuguese army a have brought many british officer with men have be armed drilled must be reckoned upon to do service if employed with british troop to give backbone portuguese peasantry be strong robust by nature courageous needed only discipline that must not receive from own officer to turn into valuable troop according to law of country man be liable for service have corrupt junta be dismissed full power be given to british army of men might have be placed in field for defence of country with proper supply of arm money so far from assisting junta threw possible impediment in way feared that real national effort if successful must get altogether beyond control that must lose power enabled to enrich at expense of people not only that be engaged in struggle for supremacy with junta of oporto be striving by mean to render supreme authority of whole of portugal terence have hoped that when arrived at lisbon must meet army have left at corunna for sir john moore instruction have be precise that fleet be to go thither instruction however have be disobeyed fleet have sailed direct for england have on way encountered great storm have scattered in direction several of ship be wrecked on coast of england army must have be of inestimable service at lisbon now served only by tattered garment emaciated frame of soldier to excite burst of misplaced indignation against memory of general whose genius have saved from destruction on arriving at head quarter stating errand terence be at once admitted to room where sir john cradock be at work be told sir that be bearer of despatch from spanish general romana before open will explain how be that came to be with terence gave brief account of manner in after being left behind on field of corunna have succeeded in joining romana general face have at first be severe softened a proceeded be altogether satisfactory mr o'connor said feared that might have be one of straggler among whom hear be many officer a well a thousand of men belonging to sir john moore army received news of glorious fight at corunna embarkation of army by ship arrived here three day since from that port have heard of death of noble soldier sir terence replied much shocked at news be terrible loss indeed be greatly loved by army saw into matter be with rearguard through retreat laboured night day to maintain order discipline be assuredly fault of if failed be own regiment in rear guard yes sir have honour of being specially chosen by sir john moore for steadiness good conduct be not with be one of brigadier general fane aide de camp be while carrying message to that horse be killed stunned by being thrown onto heap of stone sir john cradock nodded then opened romana despatch raised eyebrow slightly have be accustomed to such appeal for arm money knew how valueless be promise accompanied what force have general romana with two hundred cavalry three four thousand peasant about quarter of whom only be armed say that expects to be joined by twenty thousand men in few day have mean of judging whether statement be well founded that can not say general romana seems to to be man of greater energy than spaniard have hitherto met know that have already sent message to priest throughout part of galicia urging upon necessity of using influence among peasantry got force together in very short time after complete defeat capture of own command by french at time of blake defeat think that might do so again though whether must be of use whatever in field can not say must soult advance into portugal must think that band of sort might very much harass doubt might do so will see at rate if can obtain money from political agent have next to nothing in military chest force be at standstill for want of that doe not seem to matter while troop be ill fed ragged almost shoeless unpaid spanish portuguese rascal who hold out hand can get filled with gold a to arm be in first place wanted for purpose of portuguese militia who be likely to be good deal more useful than irregular band in second place there be mean of conveying even hundred musket let alone ten thousand romana be good enough to ask for by way be aware whether sir john moore intended army to sail to england certainly not sir know up to moment battle began preparation for embarkation went on unceasingly general fane told night before be to be taken here whether sir john may at last moment have countermanded that order be unable to say yes know that be intention for received letter from written after arrival at corunna saying that embarkation must not be effected without battle that if beat soult must at once embark bring troop round here a ney approaching force must render corunna untenable just at present arrival of tried troop must be invaluable general baird will of course have succeeded sir john moore general baird be severely wounded sir have just ridden up to general fane when be struck general hope must therefore be in command after sir john moore be killed have heard particular of battle sir john said beyond that have be fought soult have be driven back that sir john moore be killed that army have embarked safely do understand that be towards end of battle that be hurt be getting dusk at time general can not say how long fighting went on afterwards will please to sit down at table give a nearly a can sketch of position of troop of french then explain to a far a may have seen know movement of corp course of event a terence have evening before battle seen sketch map on general fane have written name position of british force of french be able to draw one closely approximating to in ten minute got up handed sketch to sir john cradock be afraid be very rough sir said think that may give idea of position of town neighbouring height position occupied by troop excellent mr o'connor have advantage of seeing sketch map that brigadier drew out sir well benefited from now point out to various movement seems to that large french battery must have galled whole line terribly on other hand be very exposed general fane said sir that thought soult be likely to be over confident army be in frightful confusion on retreat from lugo number of straggler be enormous although many came in next day field state showed that over be still absent from colour brigadier be observing that there be one advantage in namely that soult must suppose that whole army be disorganized might therefore take more liberty than must otherwise have done at rate be likely to rely upon great force of cavalry on plateau to cover battery hill from attack on left flank be for purpose that general paget posted one of regiment on eminence on right of valley have effect of completely checking french cavalry then related incident of battle a far a have come under notice very ably fought battle sir john cradock said a followed on map terence account of movement soult evidently miscalculated sir john strength fighting power of troop hurled whole force directly against position specially endeavouring to turn right force employed there be altogether insufficient for purpose from position gather that must not have known of existence of paget reserve up valley must have seen fraser division on hill above coranto suppose reckoned that turning movement must shake british position throw into confusion enable direct attack to be successful before fraser must come to support be much obliged to for description mr o'connor be very clear lucid will write note will take to mr villiers be possible that may get help from for romana will be glad if will dine with here at six o'clock be much obliged to general have nothing uniform in stand be a see almost in rag stained with mire blood think be probable that will have difficulty in buying fresh uniform in city so many officer have come out here with exaggerated idea of amount of transport that have have to cut down wardrobe to very large extent touched bell will ask captain nelson to step in said to clerk who answered captain nelson said a one of staff entered want to take mr o'connor under charge have just arrived from north be present at battle of corunna be on brigadier fane staff a at present be unattached will put down in order to morrow a extra aide de camp on staff will be leaving to morrow for northern frontier wish to see if can not get undress uniform belongs to infantry will give order on paymaster mr o'connor to honour draft for amount that may need dare say be in arrears of pay yes sir john have drawn nothing since marched from torres vedras in october chapter xii dangerous mission captain nelson at once took terence under charge certainly look a if wanted new uniform said must have have awfully rough time of if only for sake of policy ought to get into new one a soon a possible for very sight of yours must be likely to demoralize whole division by affording painful example of what might expect on campaign terence laughed know look perfect scarecrow do think that can find something really know what must have done if have not have greatcoat for must never have ventured to walk through street from little inn where put up horse if must not have hidden in can fortunately put in right way without difficulty there be man here who have made business of buying up uniform believe sends most of to england where must certainly fetch good deal more than gave for know that keep stock by for there be constant demand work out in country here doe for uniform in time many men who before marching for frontier parted with extra kit for song be glad enough to write to for fresh outfit at three time price gave two three month before wonder send surplus outfit back to england direct terence said well see there be risk of thing being lost stolen on way home being ruined by damp before be wanted again besides man think there be saying whether will ever want again how long war will last be glad to take anything can get to save further bother about terence be fortunate in being able to buy undress uniform with facing similar to of own regiment to lay in stock of underclothes at very much lower price than must have purchased for even at home before leaving shop put on new uniform left old one to be thrown away now captain nelson said when left shop be just lunch time must come with tell about wonderful march fight at end of be going down to see about horse oh be right sent down orderly to bring up to stable there be where mess said stopping before hotel find much more comfortable than having in room at head quarter besides one get away from duty here of course chief know where be can send for if be wanted one get off being set to do lot of office work in evening find much more free comfortable when have got two three of big wig of staff so have little mess of own there have room kept for here there be more than dozen officer assembled when two entered room where meal be laid for captain nelson have looked into hotel for moment on way to tailor to tell companion who terence be to say that must bring in to lunch have told of acquaintance terence be introduced round a soon a first course be taken off table be asked many question a to march battle by time when hour later party broke up have learned leading incident of campaign may guess how anxious be here one of said when moore last despatch from salamanca arrived saying that intended to advance stating reason then there be long silence sort of rumour reached said that aided by great spanish army have overthrown napoleon have entered madrid others again stated that army have be crushed with survivor be prisoner be on way to frontier in fact have certain news until three day ago when heard of battle death embarkation of army sailing for england last be terrible blunder only temporary one must think captain nelson said from mr o'connor account of state of army must think that be just a well that must have gone home to obtain entirely new rig out there must be mean of fitting out here fortnight ought to be enough to set up in respect a certainly will not be able to march for month for three month mean nelson well perhaps for three month delay will not matter materially wo matter at if french oblige by keeping perfectly quiet if soult menace portugal with invasion from north lapisse from centre victor from south may have to defend here in lisbon before six week be out personally must not be sorry said if soult doe invade north capture oporto hang bishop junta must be worth ten thousand men to for be continually at mischief hing thwart effort be worse than junta here if be possible have excited peasant so much against that desert in thousand a fast a be collected while population here hate believe quite a much a hate french why must do so heaven know when have spent more money in portugal than whole country contained before came here after party have broken up captain nelson took terence to mr villiers who on reading general letter hearing from terence how romana be situated at once said that must hand over to dollar to take to spanish general how be to carry sir will be of considerable weight if be in silver will obtain for four good mule mr villiers said escort of twelve portuguese cavalry under officer may ask sir that money will be packed in ammunition box that one except officer will know that contain anything ammunition have great faith in portuguese honesty mr o'connor a to honesty a general thing sir express opinion terence said bluntly a to honesty of political partisan have not shadow of belief moreover there be love lost between spaniard though possibly money for of portuguese leader might be allowed to pas untouched by others even of have great doubt feel convinced that none of must allow to go out of country for use of spaniard if must lay hold of by way being sentiment sir think that be pity duty be not intrusted to officer of broader view doubt whether must find one sir especially if have like be three four month in country have simply accepted duty not sought must gladly be relieved of general romana sent here with despatch be duty unless general cradock chooses messenger to carry back reply anything else with may be intrusted have for past three month be incessantly engaged on arduous fatiguing duty have ridden for last nine day by of worst road to be found in part of world must say have before same journey besides if receive general order to effect may have to stay with spanish general in case will be sure be constantly upon move that among wild mountain if treasure be handed over to will certainly do best to take safely to defend if necessary with life be assuredly duty of must gladly be relieved that sir seems to be question solely for commander in chief mr villiers gazed in angry surprise at young ensign then thinking perhaps that must put in wrong a interference in military matter with sir john cradock have not met with success desired for checked word rose to lip said shortly convoy will be ready to start from treasury at daybreak to morrow will be there if so commanded by general cradock a soon a have left house captain nelson burst into shout of laughter what be terence asked in surprise must not have missed that for twenty pound o'connor be first bit of real amusement have have since landed to see villiers who regard a greatest man in country who not only think that regulates political intrigue in spain portugal assumes to give direction of military movement also try to dictate to general on purely military matter quietly cheeked by ensign be best thing ever saw have nothing to do with military matter have no more than mule driver there think have yet even in own political line be most ill informed gullible of fool even among mass of incompetent agent who have done utmost to ruin plan have be formed doubt whether have ever be correct in single statement that have made be quite sure that prophecy have ventured upon have be falsified negotiation have entered into have failed report sent home to government be useful only if be assumed to be wrong in particular yet man be so puffed up with pride arrogance that be well nigh insupportable spaniard have fooled to top of bent have paid to do so through representation ministry at home have distributed million among arm enough have be sent to furnish nearly able bodied man in spain harm rather than good have come of still be very great man general be obliged to treat with greatest civility to pretend to give grave consideration to plan that if emanated from other man must be considered a proof that be only fit for mad house to see looking calmly in face announcing view of spanish portuguese be delightful captain nelson again burst into laughter at recollection terence joined in laugh have intention of offending said of course have often heard how be pressing general moore to march into spain promising that must be met by immense army be eager ready to drive french out of country be only waiting for coming to set about doing so know that brigadier staff used to talk about what called villiers phantom army a only said what everyone say who have be in spain never struck that be likely to give serious offence if have thought so suppose must have made difference o'connor suppose must terence admitted perhaps will do good to hear straightforward opinion for once will certainly do harm now have better tell chief that be to have money must think that will probably send trooper with a orderly certainly have reason to have higher opinion of portuguese than have will go back with captain nelson a be present will kindly tell general like bothering certainly if wish on arriving at head quarter terence sat down in anteroom took up english paper a have heard home news for last three month presently captain nelson came out from general room beckoned to followed in four five officer of rank be with general be looking greatly amused when entered so have succeeded in obtaining money for romana general said yes sir there be difficulty about mr villiers asked few question a to situation on frontier at once said must have l to take captain nelson tell that be unwise enough to express opinion a to honesty of portuguese escort that proposed to send with said what thought general have idea that mr villiers must take a offence a seemed to well have own notion on thing see general said dryly exactly coincide with experience then mr villiers claim to understand people more thoroughly than can do terence be silent for moment only went by what have seen know said after pause certainly have intention of angering mr villiers seemed to that a be responsible for taking money to romana be duty to suggest precaution appeared to necessary quite right quite right be just a well perhaps that mr villiers must occasionally hear opinion of officer of army frankly expressed certainly think that precaution suggested be wise one if mr villiers doe not do so will see that be carried out have asked captain nelson to go with taking treasure to barrack see that money be taken out of case repacked in ammunition box must be unwise in extreme to tempt cupidity of wandering party that might fall in with by sight of treasure case suggestion quite justifies opinion have formed of from brief narrative that gave of battle of corunna for present gentleman have appointed mr o'connor a extra aide de camp on staff served in capacity with brigadier general fane from time that troop marched from here be in guarantee that must in opinion of general be thoroughly fit for work think mr o'connor that going a will a officer on staff be best that must be accompanied by couple of trooper have just spoken to colonel gibbon who will detach two of best men for service in addition to being in charge of treasure will also carry despatch from to general romana with suggestion a to co operation in harassing advance of french will not detain further now forget dinner hour large party sat down to table there be officer terence have seen there in afternoon several colonel head of department of army terence although not shy by nature felt good deal embarrassed when a soon a meal be concluded several map be by general order placed upon table be asked to give a full account a be able of event have happened from time general moore marched with army from salamanca so cut off from communication be well that terence have paid great attention to conversation between general fane officer of brigade staff have studied map have made a far a must master of detail of movement of various division have gathered from fane remark fair knowledge of general moore object intention therefore when have overcome first embarrassment be able to give clear lucid account of campaign of difficulty moore have encountered overcome in course of retreat officer followed account upon map asked occasional question showed great interest in description of battle when have done sir john cradock said be sure gentleman that agree with that mr o'connor have given singularly clear lucid account of operation of army that be most creditable that so young officer must have posted up so thoroughly not only in detail of work of own brigade in general plan of campaign movement of various division of army there be also hearty compliment from officer a rose from table doubt indeed sir john one of said whether must ever have got so clear account a have given from official despatch own for one have never fully understood what seemed hopeless incursion into enemy country can not too much admire daring of conception a to success have attended there can be doubt for completely paralysed march of french army have given ample time to southern province of spain to place in position of defence if have not taken advantage of breathing time so given be fault in way detracts from chivalrous enterprise of moore indeed sir john agreed conception be truly heroic one one required le self sacrifice than daring there be few general who must venture on advance when certain that must be followed by retreat at best must hope to escape from terrible disaster be true that gained victory under circumstance be most glorious one be effect of accident rather than design have fleet be in corunna when arrived must have embarked at once in case must have be attacked with ferocity by politician at home must have be accused of sacrificing portion of army on enterprise that everyone must have seen be ordained to be failure before commenced did know general fane personally before be appointed to staff general commanded brigade of regiment formed part of course knew by sight have never have honour of exchanging word with then may ask why be appointed to staff mr o'connor terence hesitated there be nothing disliked more than talking of what have done be sort of accident general how accident mr o'connor conduct must have attracted attention in way be accident sir terence said reluctantly that general fane happened to be on board sir arthur wellesley ship at vigo when colonel went there to make report of circumstance occurred on voyage well what be circumstance general asked have shown that have detail of campaign at finger end surely must be able to tell what circumstance be that so interested general fane that selected to fill vacancy on staff terence felt that there be escape related a briefly a must account of engagement with two privateer of narrow escape from being captured by french frigate be capital account mr o'connor sir john cradock said smiling a brought to conclusion so far fail to see particular share in matter share be very small sir think can fill up fact mr be modesty have prevented from stating one of officer said happened that before sailed from ireland six week ago officer of mayo fusilier who have be invalided home in consequence of wound dined at mess told story very much a mr o'connor have told added detail mr have omitted restated that really escape of wing of regiment be entirely due to ensign who have recently joined son of one of captain of regiment said that in first place when cannon be found to be so honeycombed with rust that must have be madness to attempt to fire young officer suggested that must be bound round with rope just like handle of cricket bat suggestion be adopted be therefore able to pour in broadside crippled lugger brought sail down leaving helpless under musketry fire of troop in second place when ship be being pounded by other privateer without being able to make reply must shortly have sunk surrendered young officer suggested to one of captain that lugger lying helpless alongside must be boarded gun turned on brig suggestion led not only to saving of ship capture of brig lastly when french frigate hove in sight troop be transferred to two prize be about to make off in case one of must almost certainly have be captured suggested that must hoist french colour that must be set to work to transfer of store from ship to privateer suggestion be adopted with result on frigate approaching seeing a be supposed two french privateer engaged in rifling prize continued on way without troubling further about sir arthur wellesley issued most laudatory notice of mr o'connor conduct in general order most of present remembered seeing order now that be mentioned general turning to terence who be colouring scarlet with embarrassment confusion said kindly see have got at after mr o'connor be glad that came from source for suppose that must have got fact from even by cross questioning may think have doubt that do think that received more credit than deserved for what consider be merely idea that struck at moment such be not opinion that be sure of other officer present story have just heard of account that have given of campaign afford great promise may almost say certainty of attaining if be spared high eminence in profession narrative showed that be painstaking accurate intelligent fact that have just heard prove to be exceptionally quick in conceiving idea cool in action able to think of right thing at right time quality be requisite for great commander warmly congratulate at very commencement of career must have have opportunity afforded for showing that posse quality of gaining warm approbation of men very much older than of wide experience in profession be sorry now that be starting to morrow on can not consider useless a well a somewhat dangerous undertaking must have be glad to have utilized service at once only hope that will erelong rejoin so saying rose hour be late for terence description of campaign battle have necessarily be very long one party at once broke up officer present shaking lad warmly by hand be lucky fellow o'connor captain nelson said a accompanied to room in second bed have be set up for young ensign accommodation will certainly get on after there be dozen colonel two general of brigade among party fancy that there be not one of will not bear in mind say good word for if opportunity occurs sir john be sure to push on must say that not officer of rank in army have such good chance look such lad too did not show so much when first arrived of course be fagged travel stained then now must not take for more than seventeen indeed suppose be not a only joined service six month ago be not more than seventeen terence said quietly not thinking necessary to state that wanted good many month yet to age for to do so must provoke question a to how obtained commission before be sixteen see have have good many advantage be brought up in barrack suppose sharpens one wit bit when be quite young boy used to be good deal with junior officer of course that made older in idea than must have be if have always associated with boy of own age still have be luck though sir john be kind enough to speak very warmly about really ca see have done anything out of way luck come to good many fellow o'connor be not one who have quickness to make most of opportunity may say that be only idea see have three valuable idea none of brother officer have can not deny that brain worked more quickly than of others well may a well turn in at once a have got to be up before daylight be very glad that sir john have given couple of trooper will make feel good deal more comfortable anyhow even if get into adventure where aid may be of vital importance will indeed alone must have very little influence with portuguese guard might be perfectly honest might not be at disposed to risk life by offering opposition to band might demand ammunition must believe be in case be twice stopped by band of scantily armed peasant on way down although released on seeing letter carried to general be evident that felt little good will towards have have anything about worth taking chance of reaching lisbon must have be small junta of oporto have spared pain in spreading sort of atrocious lie against ever since escort of french prisoner interfered to save from fury of populace though perhaps peasant in part of country still feel grateful to for having delivered from exaction of french in north where french soldier have set foot have be taught to regard a enemy to be dreaded a much a french up to present time order for raising of levy have be disregarded north of douro though great quantity of arm have be sent up to oporto doubt whether single musket have be distributed by junta fellow friere general of what call army be a bad a of hope that if soult come down through pass will teach fellow patron wholesome lesson do think that troop here will march north to defend oporto must hardly think that there be chance of be force to do so lisbon must be at mercy of victor of army corp at salamanca cuesta be what call watching victor be one of most obstinate pigheaded of general victor will crush without difficulty must be at lisbon long before must get back from oporto lisbon be key of situation there be very strong position on range of hill between river sea at torres vedras must be held against greatly superior force town be protected by strong fort have be greatly strengthened since came men of war can come up to town aid in defence bring reinforcement provision can be landed at time loss of lisbon must be death blow to portuguese independence may be sure that ministry at home must eagerly seize opportunity of abandoning struggle here altogether do know at present moment while urging sir john cradock to take offensive with only men against whole army of france in peninsula have have folly to send splendid expedition of from thirty to forty thousand good troop to holland where will be powerless to do good while presence here must be simply invaluable well will not enter upon subject to night folly incapacity of mr canning crew be subject once begun must keep one talking until morning chapter xiii awkward position when captain nelson terence went out just a morning be breaking found two trooper waiting in street held spare horse one be that upon terence have ridden from coimbra other be fine english horse what horse be terence asked be present to from sir john cradock captain nelson said told last night that trooper have be ordered to ask for when took horse morning that men be ordered to hand over to wished to tell that have pleasure in presenting horse to a mark of great satisfaction at manner in have mastered military detail of sir john moore expedition clearness with have explained be indeed greatly obliged to general be most kind of terence said will please express thanks to in proper way captain nelson rode to treasury where found portuguese escort with mule waiting officer in charge of treasury be already there admitted two officer have packed money in ammunition box said received instruction from mr villiers to do so be evident that word have effect mr o'connor captain nelson said aside to terence suppose that when thought over came to conclusion that after suggestion be prudent one that must add to chance of money reaching romana be to adopt be glad that did so for have money be placed in ordinary chest then brought to barrack to be packed in ammunition case portuguese trooper must have be sure of nature of content now whatever may suspect can not be sure about because there be large amount of ammunition stored in same building of guard stationed in treasury carried chest out assisted muleteer to lash in place illustration terence receives present of horse from sir john cradock can not thank too warmly captain nelson for kindness that have shown terence said not at officer replied simply carried out general order duty have be very pleasant one think must mount that horse if be went on a terence walked towards acquisition must have led a far a coimbra while ride horse borrowed there then will be fresh for further journey must be best way doubt though stage must be comparatively short one owing to having mule with must not press if be suppose that will make much difference whether romana get money few day sooner later none must say terence laughed a mounted horse still do think that will be able to gather mob of peasant of course being almost without arm will be of use whatever for fighting still may harass soult communication cut off straggler compel to move slowly cautiously terence now saluted portuguese officer who said a returned salute name senor be juan herrara mine be terence o'connor senor journey will be somewhat long one together hope that will meet with adventure accident by way hope not senor instruction be simple be to place under order to convey eight case of ammunition to northern frontier to follow route that may point out be ordered also to pick men who be to form escort have done so think can answer that can be relied upon to do duty under circumstance terence now turned with hearty farewell to captain nelson rode on by side of lieutenant herrara two british trooper followed four mule with two muleteer kept close behind twelve portuguese trooper brought up rear be strong escort for four mule carrying ammunition portuguese officer said with smile may seem so terence laughed see country especially north of douro be greatly disturbed very much so think that precaution have be taken be very wise one have be informed what be really in case be going by with sergeant twelve men must say that to put money in ammunition case be not only absolutely useless dangerous disproportion between force value of ammunition must be so great that must attract attention at once a be with be more likely to pas without observation be officer on staff of english general have own two orderly a be carrying despatch be considered necessary that must have escort of people case in event must seem to be of little importance to be simply travelling with to have advantage of protection of escort be quite right senior herrara must have be vastly better have money be stowed in sack filled up with grain then must follow short distance behind must seem that be simply carrying forage for use on road must have be very much better senior might have done at torres vedras money be in bag containing two hundred dollar there will be trouble in transferring to sack filled with plenty of forage two of soldier have behind bundle two of faggot basket of fowl other matter can be piled on top of sack so that fact that principal load be forage must hardly be noticed might mention to muleteer thought that must be considerable saving of weight if used sack instead of heavy case that ammunition must travel just a well in one a other must arrange so that muleteer suspect anything a rule herrara said be very trustworthy there be scarcely case known in have stolen good intrusted to however valuable must be easy to place few packet of ammunition in mouth of sack call in to cord up firmly sight of ammunition must go far to lessen suspicion might have reached torres vedras that night terence spoke to officer in command there be furnished with sack required enough forage to fill box be put into room in barrack here terence with two orderly opened case transferred bag of money to centre of sack two three dozen packet of ammunition be obtained few put into mouth of sack be left open room locked up two of portuguese soldier being placed on guard before terence lieutenant herrara be invited to dine at mess have quarter assigned to terence after dinner again much more briefly than before gave officer at station sketch of retreat battle next morning muleteer be called in to fasten up sack at suggestion of officer in command tent be also taken may want badly before be done said if be must always have pitched except when be at village for can have sack in a bed so keep under eye if a tell be giving out that contain ammunition must seem natural step a be so able to keep dry mule looked more heavily laden than upon preceding day be carrying heavier burden for weight of tent pole basket of fowl terence valise other article be considerably le than of eight heavy case have be left behind two officer now rode at head of detachment two only of portuguese soldier kept in rear of mule now followed at distance of thirty forty yard behind stopped that night at rolica next at leirya be long march short one next day brought to pombal following afternoon arrived at coimbra here spent pleasant evening with regiment stationed in town by way o'connor one of officer said after dinner be over cigar lighted suppose happen to have relation at oporto well do happen to have terence answered in surprise why do ask well be singular officer said will tell how happened be with party escorted french prisoner down to oporto just a have got into town be before row began being early in morning there be very few people about head appeared at window on second floor of big convent standing on left side of road remember name be carved over door be convent of santa maria happened to catch sight of nun at once dropped little letter fell close to picked up stuck into glove thought more about for time for mob soon began to gather to yell threaten prisoner hand be too full till have got safely on board ship to think more of matter when took off glove letter fell out be simply addressed 'to english officer ' english girl be detained here prisoner principally because spanish relation wish to seize property have be made nun by force though father be protestant taught religion pray to endeavour to obtain freedom be made most miserable here be kept in solitary confinement have nothing to eat bread water because will not sign renunciation of property bishop of oporto have threatened be useless to appeal to nothing english army being stationed here can save have pity upon aid ' be signed beary o'connor ' of course british troop have be there since if be sent there have made up mind to bring matter before general ask to interfere on poor girl behalf though know that must be awkward matter for if there be one thing that portuguese be more touchy about than be interference in religious matter bishop who be most intolerant rascal must be last man who must give way on subject have not least doubt in world that be cousin of mine terence said father went out to join firm of wine merchant in oporto know that married very rich portuguese heiress that have one daughter father told that gathered from cousin letter that wife did not get on very well together died two year ago be quite possible that mother who may perhaps want to marry again have shut girl up in convent to get rid of altogether to make sign document renouncing right to property in favour of herself possibly a bishop seems to have meddled in affair partly of church quite see that nothing can be done now if do occupy oporto day be likely enough will speak to general if say that be matter that can not entertain will see what can do to get out be awkward work o'connor fooling with nunnery either here in spain portuguese be not so bigoted a spaniard across frontier there be not much difference if anyone be caught meddling with nunnery must tear to piece especially in oporto where men who be even suspected of hostility to bishop be murdered day want to run risk of being torn to piece certainly after what have told of letter will not let little cousin be imprisoned life in nunnery robbed of property without making strong effort to save will give letter presently o'connor have in pocket book at quarter by by how old be cousin about own age little younger subject of conversation be then changed hour later officer left room returned with letter at rate said if do go to oporto will have more opportunity for getting general to move than must terence have handed over horse have borrowed with many thanks for use received own again be in good condition after rest of seven eight day be by mean valuable animal thought a well to take on with in case of other horse must meet with accident break down during journey through mountain coimbra be last british station through must pas real difficulty of journey must now begin terence have before starting received sum of money for maintenance of escort upon way have done in power to see that trooper be comfortable at various halting place journey a far a douro passed without adventure encountered on road several band of peasant armed with pike club hoe few gun be for most part ordenancas levy called out when larger force than regular troop militia be required be on way to join force assembling under edict beyond pausing to stare at british officer with two dragoon behind escort of own troop paid attention to party crossed douro at st joa de pesquiera on stopping at large village ten mile beyond found occupied by rabble of two thousand men absolutely useless for service in field capable of offering obstinate defence to passage of river of impeding enemy advance through mountain defile a stopped before principal inn man dressed in attempt at uniform came out from door be british officer sir asked terence raising broad hat courteously be officer on english general staff be proceeding on mission from to northern frontier to ascertain best mean of defence route that enemy be most likely to move by if attempt to invade portugal from direction french general must hardly venture to do that officer said disdainfully when there will be portuguese to bar way may be in ignorance of force will gather to meet terence said gravely with difficulty restraining smile at confident tone of leader of armed mob however have order to carry out do not think said turning to herrara that will be better for to go on to next hamlet if there be one within two three mile fear there be little chance of obtaining accommodation for men here there be need for that portuguese colonel broke in there be large house at end of village be at present vacant proprietor who be disturber of peace who belonged to french faction be killed last week in course of disturbance created by a commissioner of junta here have house closed up be quite at service a march have already be long one terence thought best to accept offer colonel called man who presently brought key accompanied to house in question showed sign at once of mob violence snow in garden be trampled down window broken one of lower one smashed in a if entry have be effected here door be riddled with bullet hole upon being opened destruction within be seen to be complete room being strewn with broken furniture litter of sort at rate there be plenty of firewood lieutenant said a ordered men to clear out one of room there have be dastardly work here went on a man who have brought key left place yes have doubt proprietor whoever be have be foully murdered a likely a not by order of fellow met who say be commissioner of junta must not be surprised if have trouble with before have done must think herrara have better send off couple of men to get what can in way of provision skin of wine be cheerless looking place broken window be not of much use for keeping out cold bull have better see if can find something among rubbish to hang up in front of window for in present state merely creates draught orderly went out returned with two torn curtain there have be bad work going on here sir said there be pool of blood in three of room upstairs be evident that there have be desperate struggle one of door be broken in there be several shot hole through be afraid there have be bad work suppose man here be obnoxious to somebody so murdered however be not business of horse be stabled in large shed others in lower room of house soldier muleteer taking possession of large kitchen where soon have huge fire burning window on side of house be unbroken two orderly soon fastened up curtain across window of officer room when fire be lighted have more cheerful aspect burden of mule be brought into room opposite where there be key in door bar across window presently soldier returned with meat couple of fowl bread wine together with bunch of candle fowl be soon plucked cut in two grilled over fire in quarter of hour after men return two officer sat down to supper meal be just finished when there be knock at outer door soldier acting a sentry came in said that colonel cortingos desired to speak to suppose be fellow saw in town terence said show in supposition be correct one for man entered accompanied by two others terence have doubt that fellow be author of attack upon house murderer of proprietor others did not feel disposed to be exceptionally civil to a have couple of thousand men under command have certainly put only available place in village at disposal rose a entered two gentleman colonel began form with committee appointed by junta of oporto to organize national resistance here in surrounding neighbourhood to keep eye upon person suspected of being favourable to enemy to arrest send to oporto for trial be also enjoined to make close inquiry into business of person who may pas through here have already told terence said quietly that be officer on staff of english general have mission from to see what be best mean of defending northern pass may add to enter into such arrangement a may think proper with leader of band who may be gathered for purpose of defending a be acting under direct order of general in way recognize right of local authority to interfere with in way lieutenant herrara have be ordered by colonel of regiment to command escort of portuguese cavalry told off to accompany british officer also feel free from interference examination by civilian be colonel cortingos said angrily by whom appointed if may ask by junta of oporto be not aware that possessed right of granting high commission herrara said although of course can grant temporary rank to who command irregular force british officer have assured a to object of journey unless object have have approval of military authority at lisbon must not have be furnished with escort by have only word yours a to cortingos said insolently be acting under order of supreme authority of province be doing duty doubt lieutenant said in making inquiry officer have answered will answer further question if consider to be reasonable wish in first place cortingos said to examine official pass may have received official pass be uniform herrara replied haughtily uniform have be useful for purpose of disguise before now cortingos replied again ask to show authority here be authority terence broke in here be despatch from general sir john cradock to general romana ah ah spaniard spanish general marquis grandee of spain who have be fighting french who be now with portion of army preparing to defend pass into portugal cortingos held out hand for paper terence put back again into breast pocket of uniform sir said communication be for marquis of romana for only one else touch so long a be alive to defend colonel whispered to two associate will let that pas for present replied turning to terence again said in next place wish to know nature of content of sack be being carried by mule that accompany contain ammunition forage for horse lieutenant herrara said can if choose muleteer who fastened up sack have opportunity of seeing ammunition in name of junta demand that ammunition cortingos said with air of authority be monstrous that ammunition must be taken to spaniard who have already shown that be incapable of using with effect while here have loyal men ready to die in country defence altogether unprovided with ammunition for sir must apply to junta since give order let give ammunition there be enough in oporto to supply whole population have arm may be assured that men will see that convoy intrusted to charge reach destination illustration in name of junta demand that ammunition believe that there be not only ammunition money in sack said cortingos must be act of treachery to allow to pas when even if not taken to directly might fall into hand of french be needed here men lack shoe clothes a say object of mission be to see to defence of frontier money may have can not be better applied than to satisfy necessity of soldier however wish to take step might appear unfriendly therefore if will allow to inspect content of sack will let pas on if find that contain money confiscating only ammunition for use of troop of province refuse absolutely herrara said to allow anything confided to charge to be touched be final decision man said with sneer final absolute also will do duty then without word colonel with two associate left house will have trouble with fellow herrara said so much better terence replied have evidence here that scoundrel be murderer doubt have private enmity against owner of establishment so denounced to junta then attacked place murdered perhaps of servant sacked house wo find so easy job a be last time window be barred there be only three on floor to defend shutter of two of be uninjured so be only one where broke in before that can attack while men at window upstairs will make hot for a approach must hardly think that men call soldier will venture to attack party of regular troop lieutenant shrugged shoulder will tell lie probably assert that be french agent in disguise taking money to french army indeed there be order discipline among band roused to pitch of fury must murder own leader a readily a anyone else junta act a if province be altogether independent number of men of position have be butchered on pretence of being adherent of french when sole crime be that disapproved of doings of bishop tool will see that night will not pas off without something happening of

fight wait minute two terence said after moment hesitation will then give answer herrara have followed out heard offer know what to do herrara terence said a re entered house instruction be to join romana to remain with for time sending word to lisbon a to state of thing aiding in way in power here be between two three thousand stout healthy fellow evidently disposed to fight if be armed must not hesitate moment suppose that there be hundred musket among certainly romana have none to give still in defile might give good deal of trouble to french by rolling stone down breaking up bridge sort of thing must be good fun herrara laughed a for myself said have order to return a soon a have seen treasure safely in romana camp if have be for must have liked nothing better though there must not have be much chance for cavalry work in defile will talk to again terence said be not often that one get chance of independent command be just sort of work must like went out again must like to command number of brave fellow said question be about arm there have be quantity sent out by england for use instead of being served out junta keep hidden up in magazine even now when french be going to invade country still keep locked up send out with only pike stave to fight against well armed army be nothing short of murder down with junta cried dozen of men standing near enough to hear what be said say 'down with junta terence replied do say take arm if can get be there magazine near here there be one at castro ten mile away man said know that there be waggon load of arm there well friend matter stand thus a british officer can not lead to break open magazine say if choose to go in body to castro do arm yourselves with musket that can find there bring with good store of ammunition in cart that must take with from here then come to at spot where will halt to night five six mile beyond castro will take command of mind if command command must have absolute obedience be only by obeying order without question that can hope to do good first man who disobeys will shoot on spot if others be disposed to support will leave at once will consult others man said many of know will be glad to fight under english officer agree to obey implicitly very well will give quarter of hour to decide before time have elapsed dozen men came to door with principal spokesman have made up mind senor will follow will arm ourselves at castro be sin that arm must be lying there idle with so many hand ready to use be good terence said now first order be that wait until have be gone hour then that form up in military order four abreast men with gun in front others after must go a soldier not a mob must march into castro peacefully quietly not man must straggle from rank must go to authority demand arm ammunition if refuse to give to march always in regular order to magazine burst open then distribute musket hundred round of ammunition to man having one take rest of store in cart then march away along road north until come to place where be halted observe most perfect order in castro if man plunder meddles in way with inhabitant be reported to will know how to punish from moment that leave place remember that be soldier of portugal must behave so a to be honour to a well a defence now let shout 'viva portugal ' great shout followed word then terence went indoors five minute later started with convoy telling three prisoner must go where liked chapter xiv independent command a left village portuguese lieutenant burst into sudden fit of laughter what be lieutenant terence asked be laughing at way in who a tell have only be six month in army without hesitation organize what be really rising against authority having already taken representative of junta prisoner yes must remember that took upon to endeavour to forcibly posse of treasure in charge be true enough still did capture treated with considerable personal indignity imprisoned threatened life then incite say ordenancas to break open magazine lieutenant did not incite will remember expressed desire to march under command to fight against french simply pointed out to that have arm asked if must get hearing that there be plenty lying useless few mile away suggested that arm must do more good in hand than stowed away in magazine upon agreeing with on head advised to proceed in quiet orderly way to have rioting disturbance of sort said that if after arming came to still wished to follow must undertake to command see everything depends upon manner in thing be put must remember senor that junta will naturally view matter in light in representative will place before think unlikely terence replied that will have opportunity of doing so took care that be removed from window before met deputy of men will consequently be unaware of arrangement made will perhaps go out a soon a have left try to persuade men to follow attack a be possible that might take course took precaution of sending out one of muleteer with instruction to mention casually to men be leaving three fellow behind that might be a well for to confine under guard so a to prevent going to oporto at present making mischief agree with senor that be certainly not likely to make report a to proceeding here fancy not in fact must not be at surprised if at present moment be hanging from window of house of man caused to be murdered will most richly deserve fate may save trouble doubt junta will hear day that ordenancas here rose killed three member of committee obtained arm at castro marched into mountain junta will care nothing for killing of three agent plenty of men of same kind can be found to do work that mutineer afterwards fell in with british officer placed under command will not concern junta one way other will certainly be great deal more useful in way than must be in remaining unarmed here may even when french once get in motion come to regard affair altogether a satisfactory if new levy be to act in exactly same way portugal must be very materially benefited how be going to feed be rather serious question suppose will have to be fed in same way a other irregular band however will consider fully justified in devoting fifth of money be carrying to purpose obtained from villiers l to enable romana to support levy be raising levy will be for most part unarmed therefore practically useless a portuguese will be at rate fairly armed be likely to be of very much greater service than horde of galician peasant portion at least of money can be very much more usefully employed in feeding than be given to romana have doubt that when explain circumstance to general cradock will entirely approve of appropriating small portion of money that villiers have chosen to throw away on romana when return will get to carry report from to general stating what have done have doubt will warmly approve of on approaching castro made detour to avoid town there may be more representative of junta there terence said may have even more trouble with than have with last want more bother especially a have much greater interest in money now than have before have not shadow of belief in band of portuguese peasant do think that with aid of two trooper will be able to lick fellow into sort of shape to annoy soult if can not stop hope will find good supply of powder besides musket ammunition at castro will want for blowing up bridge work of sort wish must go with herrara said really see why must not must take blame on own shoulder one of trooper must carry report to general will say that under circumstance have taken upon to retain with in order to assist in drilling organizing band conceiving that service with must be very much more useful than with regiment see be placed under order so that blame can fall upon for obeying at rate certainly will be doing vastly better service to country than if be stationed at lisbon with prospect of advance for long time to come still of course will not retain against will must like of thing herrara said do really think that general must approve have not least doubt that must at rate if did not must only blame not help must certainly be invaluable to so must that of men be picked soldier if divided force up into twelve company must very soon teach a much drill a be necessary for work like trooper must command one of company two orderly must act a field officer must be colonel must be political officer in command herrara burst into fit of laughter be strangest fellow ever met senor here be very serious business take a easily a if be game of play however doe seem to that might do good service at rate be quite willing to obey order must be adventure to talk of one life be right terence said there will be credit to be gained too indeed can safely say that band will be very much better organized than nineteen out of twenty of irregular band track followed be very bad one point at regained main road be eight mile north of castro there be small village here at once halted although have travelled slowly knew that men must not come along for time a be not to start until hour after must be detained for considerable time at castro be indeed nearly three hour before column marching in good order be seen coming along road be good sign terence said have obeyed order strictly whether have got arm can not tell yet men at head of column have certainly musket a armed men be to go in front be proof however a column approached must be seen at rate very considerable number be armed have better form up a come herrara if head of column stop will stop then there will be confusion road through village be wide when hundred rank have passed be halted faced round marched forward so continued until village be filled with dense mass of men twenty deep terence observed with satisfaction that have with six bullock cart filled with ammunition case spare musket powder barrel men who have first spoken to terence have headed column have stopped by side a others marched in have succeeded see said hope that be enabled to accomplish without violence be too much surprised to offer much resistance five fellow who said be committee appointed by junta came to told that unless dispersed at once must be severely punished told that have come out of home at order of junta that a junta have not supplied with arm have come for a be not going to fight french with nothing stick then threatened again told that if hindered from defending country must hang at once a saw meant went quietly off to house then broke down door of magazine found four thousand musket there man took one left remainder enough ammunition for have brought rest here together with hundred spare musket have observed excellent order one be hurt alarmed only men who left rank be score who went round to baker shop by order bought up bread in place found bag with thousand dollar at quarter of cortingos what became of two associate have impudence to come out harangue when have gone tied up to branch of tree so there be end of very fitting end too terence said what have done with money bag be in cart senor have better appoint four of number a treasurer must rather not touch must be a careful a can spend only on barest necessary of life will have few opportunity of buying thing in mountain when do come upon must be paid for of course will go farther to night how many men have about two thousand five hundred senor must be told off into twelve company will be two hundred ten to company will appoint one of soldier to company to drill command propose that company will elect other officer lieutenant herrara will under order command regiment two english soldier with will take command of six company first thing to be done be to tell off men into company will at once do after that can be marched just outside village company will then fall out elect officer when be done men will be quartered in village have set apart one room in house for inhabitant men must pack a tightly a can into others of course shed stable must also be utilized with assistance of trooper work of dividing force up into company be accomplished in hour herrara then called men to will take command of company said drill teach use of arm force be now under command of british officer acting under order take command of force under so long a be out will act a captain of company british comrade will act a field officer taking command of six company be going to hinder advance of french to cut communication with spain will be glorious most honourable duty rely most implicitly on doing best to make men under command fit to meet enemy captain juan sanches will take first company so allotted to command soldier saluted gravely with air of delight will in first place march men to various spot around village will then fall out select six officer will see that man know number of company so that can fall in without hesitation a soon a order be given while be away will examine house allot so many to company in meantime terence have be similarly instructing two orderly although standing at attention broad grin of amusement stole over face a went on did not expect more than did said order be open one be to assist general romana in hindering advance of french think can not do so better than by augmenting force by well armed men rely greatly upon to assist in work will a see occupy position of field officer while portuguese trooper will have command of company in order to support authority will address a major can consider that hold rank a long a be out with force have seen enough of to know that will do duty well will understand that be going to be child play will be dangerous service will spare under command there will be lot of fighting opportunity for to distinguish yourselves hope that will be able to speak in high term of when send in report to general cradock will do best sir andrew macwitty said how be to address will keep to mr o'connor will consider political officer with supreme military authority title be simply for local purpose to give authority among portuguese know enough of lingo to give word of command sir william bull said will not matter portuguese dragoon will teach a much drill a be necessary for to know if have to post in position can do well enough by sign at same time be most desirable that must both set to work in earnest try to pick up little of language know enough to make start with if ride day with one other of captain of company when be drilling men stand by listen to will soon learn enough to give men necessary order a rule two wing will act a separate regiment of be rather stronger than of line regiment at full war strength will be more convenient to treat a separate regiment until get to frontier march few mile apart in way can occupy different village obtain better accommodation than if be together have money enough to buy bread wine for time captain under have better form sort of mess will of course draw ration of bread wine will provide with money to buy sheep occasionally fowl to keep in meat two trooper walked gravely away a soon a be at little distance turned round corner of house burst into shout of laughter how be finding to day major macwitty just first rate how be yoursel ' major bull again went off into shout of laughter be rum start mistake macwitty ay be ' unpleasant one reckon mr o'connor know what be about though be little more than laddie orderly who brought order to go with said have heard from one of general mess waiter that general other officer be saying young officer have done something quite out of way be paying compliment on general have put on own staff in consequence be saying something about having saved wing of regiment from being captured by french man have not heard just scrap a went in out of room with wine said seemed something out of way mighty creditable now what do think of affair bull there be one thing be that there be like to be a said plenty of fighting for must say that be just sort of fellow to give chance of do think that portuguese fellow really mean to fight think that mysel ' there be answering for brown skin chap still maybe be fault of officer a well a men will be rare game anyhow macwitty at rate will do best to get fellow into order be fine young officer thorough gentleman mistake go about a if have be accustomed to command two regiment life portuguese fellow seem to have taken to wonderfully at rate will be thing for to talk about life how be major for bit fought french on own account yes if get home to tell about macwitty said cautiously dinna think can reckon much on be desperate sort of business be ower young to command must rather have young officer than old one bull said carelessly though be irish feel sure that have got head screwed on right way look how well managed last night why old general must not have done better if have caught three fellow in trap doubt whether must have got out of scrape sixteen seventeen men against over two thousand be pretty long odds must have accounted for lot of must have done for in end be right there bull thought mysel ' that be awkward fix certainly managed portuguese fellow well turned lot round little finger ay ay know what be doing perfectly well young a be well have best be off to look after command bull laughed suppose will call mine first regiment a have right wing while men be away terence herrara with head man of village went round to house marked on piece of paper number of men who must manage to lie down on floor passage with number of company fixed on door also made arrangement with proprietor of neighbouring vineyard to supply a much wine a be required at rate of pint to man when men returned four men be told off from company to fetch ration of bread four to carry wine be accompanied by one of newly elected sergeant to check quantity see that be done in order to prevent confusion company be kept drawn up until ration have be distributed then be taken into quarter filling room attic cellar barn granary stable in village then terence herrara in one room trooper in of little inn sat down to meal terence have ordered a soon a arrived next morning at daybreak marched off terence rode at head herrara at rear of regiment captain at head of company from time to time terence rode up down line ordered men to keep step be just a easy said to captain for men to do so a to walk along anyhow will find that sound of footfall together help to march steadily lessens fatigue never mind about slope of musket must not harass about little thing else will get sulky will come gradually four march of twenty mile took over mountain in four day portuguese marched well not single man fell out from rank while at end of day be still fresh enough to allow of hour drill even in short time there be very appreciable difference in appearance have already learned to keep distance on march to slope musket more evenly on shoulder to carry with more erect bearing first two drill have be devoted to teaching how to load aim other two to change of formation from column into line back again must make fine soldier sir bull said on fourth evening after have have six month drill doubt must move more regularly terence agreed in mountain warfare make little difference a soon a have learned to shoot straight to have confidence in will do just a well holding defile head of bridge a if have be drilled for month must get hold of horn of sort must learn few simple call such a advance retire form square thing of sort with such large company voice must never be heard in din of battle hope that will get at least week to practise skirmishing over rough ground to fall back in good order taking advantage of rock shelter before get under fire do know anything about blowing up bridge not sir be engineer business be thing that trooper ought to know something about too bull for if be far in advance without engineer near might do good service by blowing up bridge checking advance of enemy however dare say will soon find out how be best done now to morrow morning will have three hour of skirmishing work on hillside by time other regiment will have come up then will march together to join romana spanish general be much surprised at arrival of terence at head of two well armed regiment force have swelled considerably in point of number for have sent messenger over country to priest having horror of french have stirred up peasant by threat of eternal perdition if came back while romana issued proclamation threatening death to who did not take up arm thus have men collected of whom fully half be own dispersed soldier received terence with effusion have brought arm be first question sir transport must be obtained in lisbon be found impossible to despatch musket to have however four thousand pound in dollar to hand over at starting have five thousand of have in exercise of discretion retained thousand for purchase of provision necessary for two portuguese regiment be under command with hope to do good service by co operating with force have not found great difficulty in victualling men have have trouble on score marquis said found that magazine of provision have be collected for use of general moore army at montrui three mile from here have be supporting troop on content money will be most useful however directly move fully half of men have gun for galician peasant be accustomed to use of arm wish that have be more four thousand pound will be very welcome do propose to join force with regiment not exactly to join general order be to give such assistance a can think can do more by co operating with independently in first place think that portuguese must like to be commanded by spanish general in second place must be extremely difficult to feed so large body of troop in mountain smaller number more easily can move about besides in defile large force of undisciplined men must not act efficiently in case of reverse must fall rapidly into confusion propose to use force a sort of flying column co operating with yours thus if attack head of column will fall on flank rear will harass line of communication blow up bridge destroy road so render movement slow difficult by such mean must certainly render more efficient service than if regiment be to form part of force perhaps must be best romana said must supply with ammunition for although peasant have gun very few have more than few round of ammunition even be not made up into cartridge can do sir can give round of ammunition ten barrel of powder have lead may perhaps be able to obtain that priest in fact have sent in considerable amount have stripped roof off church will be most welcome supply indeed be heartily obliged to gift of ammunition have effect of doing away with discontent spaniard may have felt on finding terence be going to act independently of have indeed already flashed across mind that might be unpleasant always to have british officer with from whose opinion might frequently differ who might endeavour to control movement have hardly expected that with so much on hand claim must be made from oporto for assistance must have sent money sixteen thousand dollar be therefore most welcome while ammunition must be invaluable to terence have taken out share of money cart with remainder for romana be now at door sack be brought in romana called in four five officer dollar be counted out receipt given to terence for will send ammunition up in hour marquis thank greatly senor will at once order number of men to set to work casting bullet preparing cartridge case in meantime please let hear what be general plan for defence of portugal terence told that be unaware what be intention of british general that from what learned during few hour that be at lisbon thought improbable in extreme sir john cradock must be able to send force to check advance of french upon oporto in first place said be absolutely without transport in second victor have large army now saragossa have fallen there be nothing to prevent marching direct upon lisbon lapisse be at salamanca can enter portugal from east whole country be in confusion with exception of force gathering under lord beresford there be army whatever lisbon be almost at mercy of mob who supported by government march about with british musket pike killing suspect of being favourable to french even attacking british soldier officer in street be general to march north must not get news of victor advance in time to get back to save lisbon therefore fear that be absolutely impossible for to attempt to check french until cross douro perhaps not until cross mondego levy of northern province be ordered to assemble at villa real believe from what gathered on march that thousand of men be there doubt very greatly whether be in state to offer determined resistance to soult be bad look out general said gloomily still must hope for best a spain will soon raise fresh army so occupy attention of enemy that soult will have to fall back be in communication with general silveira who will advance to chaves have four thousand men have written to that bishop have collected peasant at oporto where will probably do more harm than good terence said scornfully must rather have regiment of british troop than whole lot of be not men be wanted be discipline peasant will be even more unmanageable useless than must be by way general have now to inform that general cradock have done honour of placing on personal staff be glad to hear marquis said courteously will certainly increase authority greatly terence leaving romana marched troop to within mile of monterey choosing spot where there be wood must afford shelter to troop must give supply of firewood at monterey must be able to purchase provision wished to keep apart from romana men whose undisciplined habit general insubordination must counteract effort with own men next ten day be spent in almost incessant drilling in practising shooting bread wine be obtained from monterey purchased large flock of sheep at very low price peasant in fear of french being very anxious to turn flock herd into money must be hid away securely until tide of invasion have passed laborious frugal in habit peasant seldom touch meat troop be highly gratified at ration supplied to worked hard cheerfully at drill among so many men there be naturally few who be inclined to be insubordinate be speedily weeded out offender be promptly seized flogged expelled from force place being supplied from among peasant many of whom be desirous of enlisting terence sent off save few selected to silveira a own force be quite a large a must properly be handled with improved food incessant drill men rapidly developed into soldier carried rough native blanket rolled up like scarf over one shoulder be indeed only point of regular equipment have regular uniform be in peasant dress there be communication between romana force for animosity between two people amounted to hatred portuguese must indeed have marched to attack a willingly a must have received order to move against french during week of waiting silveira with men arrived at chaves meeting took place between romana have plan equally wild impracticable must give way a be well aware that force must never act together decided to act independently against french at end of eight day news came that soult having made preparation have left orense on march southward terence have bought quantity of rough canvas men a sat round fire after day work be over made haversack in must carry ration for four five day a soon a news be received that soult be advancing terence ordered sufficient bread to supply for time from bakehouse of monterey hundred round of ball cartridge be served round to light cart containing eight barrel of powder bag with dollar tent be only vehicle taken rest of ammunition powder be buried deep in wood bulk of money privately hidden in spot by terence herrara twelve horn have be obtained several of men be able to blow attached one to company have learned few call terence herrara took post at edge of wood to watch two regiment march past think will do terence said have picked up marvellously since have be here though must not like to trust in plain with franceschi cavalry sweeping down upon think that in mountain work can be trusted to make stand think so herrara agreed have certainly improved wonderfully peasant be very docile easily led when have confidence in commander be not stirred up by agitator be given to sudden fury a be shown by frightful disorder at lisbon oporto however certainly have confidence in if be successful in first skirmish two can be trusted to fight stoutly afterwards chapter xv first skirmish soult have spent month in making preparation for invasion of portugal time however have not be wasted by vigo tuy guardia have be occupied without opposition salvatierra on minho have be taken possession of thus three road be open to by to cross low down on river namely at guardia tuy salvatierra road afforded shortest easiest line to oporto romana silveira have be of opinion that must march south from orense through monterey up valley of tamega plan be made with view of opposing advance in direction night before terence marched called upon romana seems to probable marquis a doe to that french will advance by line be possible that may follow north bank of minho cross at salvatierra tuy by route must have several river to cross mountain defile be to throw troop across there must meet with opposition until arrived at oporto seems to that best plan must be to march west endeavour to prevent such passage being made if must do so must prevent position being turned there be bridge marked on map if must secure boat must at rate cause soult much difficulty delay doubt there be local levy there must be able to watch considerable extent of river indeed so far a can see must cross if cross at there at one of three town on north side for be only by road running through that must carry artillery baggage think will be excellent plan romana said for although believe that will come way have be very uneasy at thought that might possibly cross lower down so turn position altogether will have to watch not only three place through road pas other part of river for may throw few hundred men across in boat at point falling suddenly upon party on bank might drive away enable main body to cross without resistance will keep a sharp look out a can marquis marching north from monterey troop moved through villa real gingo then turning west crossed river lima there small stream then following valley of river for distance turned off struck minho opposite salvatierra having covered fifty mile in two day here considerable number of armed peasant ordenancas be gathered be delighted at arrival of two well armed regiment hearing from herrara that terence be staff officer of british general be sent by to direct defence of river at once placed under order terence found to satisfaction that on approach of french most of boat have be removed to south side of river hauled up bank first order be that anyone acquainted with position of boat on other side of river must at once inform of be not long before heard of twenty thirty have be hidden by owner on other side in order that might have mean of crossing to escape french exaction at several boat be launched party of men directed by who have given information started to cross river bring boat over minho be at time in flood be running with great rapidity terence felt confident that in present state none of enemy cavalry must attempt to cross by swimming decided on placing largest part of force opposite tuy a principal road south passed through town must here be supported by gun of fortress of valenca stationed first battalion here with order to line river for six mile above below spot half of second battalion left under macwitty with other half determined to march down towards mouth of river next morning boat returned bringing for have be searching after closely questioning guide felt assured that there must be so few remaining that french must hardly attempt to cross river in face of crowd of peasant whom must not see lining southern bank a soon a boat have returned marched with three company when way between valenca caminha met peasant who have crossed from northern bank in boat have escaped search of french reported that day before of french have arrived in neighbourhood of village campo sancos that division have be hard at work since arrival transporting large fishing boat heavy gun from harbour of guardia to campo sancos gun have be placed in battery on height boat launched in little river ran into minho village terence learned that work be now nearly completed peasant have risked life in coming across to give information terence at once sent off mounted man to valenca to request herrara to march down with first battalion to send on to macwitty to leave one company to assist ordenancas to guard river between salvatierra valenca to take post with other two in front of latter town at nightfall be joined by herrara after explaining situation to terence said will not be necessary to watch river above campo sancos for must be impossible to row heavy fishing boat against stream so must land somewhere between place mouth of river thus have only eight mile to guard a have eighteen hundred men besides peasant ought to be able to do thoroughly expect will endeavour to make passage to night will certainly cross a nearly a can opposite village battery be about mile below be doubt intended to cover landing will post with two company of first battalion there extend company from point up to campos sancos with other three company three company of second battalion will watch river below be unlucky that there be moon at present expect however that attack will take place till morning for in first place peasant said that although gun have be got up to height have not yet be placed in position a have noticed movement there day seen french soldier anywhere near river will only be beginning work now can hardly have finished until well on in night besides when first party who crossed have obtained footing here boat will have to go backwards forward doubt cavalry will be among first to cross must hardly get horse on board in dark be of vital importance to repel attack for if french got across must be at vianna to morrow evening at oporto three day later suppose place will resist for day if a be probable victor move up from south soult may be in front of lisbon in ten day time have better tell captain in order that may understand how vital be to prevent passage from what hear from peasant boat will not be able to carry more than three four hundred men wherever land ought to be able to crush before boat can cross again bring over reinforcement well bull think be likely to have fighting tonight terence said a herrara marched off with men hope so sir think will be able to cross in face will do men lot of good to win first fight if romana troop be worth anything soult must find in awkward position have got whole army jammed up in corner here if can not cross there be nothing for to do to march along river to orense then come down by road through monterey there be several stream to cross a march up bank romana be sure to have heard of concentrating somewhere down near mouth of river must think that by time will have crossed near orense will arrive in time to dispute passage of stream told that galician peasant have be so enraged by cattle being carried off for use of french army that will rise in insurrection instant french march if be case romana ought to be able to give soult lot of trouble before reach orense think fellow with romana be likely to do much sir french will just sweep before be afraid so bull still if can prevent french from crossing here compel to follow long road through monterey will have done good service must give portugal seven eight day to prepare will send enemy through country where undisciplined troop ought to be able to make stand even against soldier like french through night terence major patrolled bank from point facing campo sancos to mile below on french be placing gun everything went on quietly sentry at interval kept watch men wrapped in blanket lay down in party of fifty at short interval day be beginning to break terence said a met bull coming back from lower end of line be not afraid now for if can see coming can gather two three hundred men at point may be making for besides shooting must be very wild in dark that must sir not one shot in fifty must hit boat let alone men when portuguese saw boat come on without pause in spite of fire must be likely to lose heart to get unsteady may a well stop here bull will be light enough to see across river in quarter of hour if there be boat coming then think be pretty certain that will not begin until to morrow night peasant said that have only got troop there a yet know soult have more than double may wait day for to come up ten minute later one of sentry close to shouted out that must see boat terence ran up to where be man nearly opposite sir terence gazed fixedly for moment then said see be heading straight across then gave order to man who always accompanied with horn to blow alarm at sound troop sprang to foot hundred of peasant who be lying down short distance behind ran up horn be evidently heard on other side of river for immediately gun of battery opposite opened fire shot whizzed overhead boat plied oar vigorously french soldier cheered be three hundred yard away when first discovered portuguese be coming rapidly up at double terence shouted that not shot be to be fired until gave order be obeyed by own men peasant at once began wild fire at boat by time be within fifty yard of shore terence saw with satisfaction fully company have come up men stood firmly although ball from french battery ploughed up ground around wait until first boat ground terence shouted again minute first fishing boat touched shore then horn sounded front line of portuguese poured terrible volley into few of french soldier only succeeded in gaining land be at once shot down then troop opened rolling fire upon other boat french replied with musketry fire be feeble have expected to have effected landing with slight opposition concentrated fire of troop peasantry convinced that even must gain shore must be greatly outnumbered must be shot down before must gather in regular formation many of rower who be spanish peasant forced into work have fallen most of comrade left oar threw into bottom of boat craft drifted down stream shout of triumph rose from portuguese who obeyed signal to form four marched along parallel with boat forming line occasionally firing heavy volley french soldier now seized oar rowed craft into middle of river then slowly painfully made way to campo sancos having lost more than half of three hundred men who have left there french battery ceased to fire din of battle be succeeded by dead silence once convinced that french have abandoned attempt to land portuguese broke into loud shout of triumph be only checked when terence ordered to form up in close order when did so addressed few word to complimenting upon steadiness that have shown upon obeying order to reserve fire till french be close at hand be convinced that must behave well said in future will have hesitation in meeting body of french equal in number to yourselves messenger be at once despatched to order up troop have be posted below in two hour whole force with exception of three company between salvatierra be assembled question be herrara terence said when colonel have exchanged congratulation on repulse of french what will soult do next be question upon everything depends think will try again here have be eight day in preparing boat to cross now that know there be very strong force here that even if got three four time a many boat must scarcely be able to force passage idea be that will abandon attack march at once for orense in case question be will wait until have assured ourselves that have gone then follow harass rear will march up river then cross to help romana to bar passage think latter will be best plan see must not be cutting communication be to march now because when have crossed river avia will have direct communication with ney will of course draw supply from north so think that have better lose time in pushing up along river troop be ordered to light fire cook breakfast while be going on terence assembled peasant band told that thought french must not make attempt to cross that must remain in state of watchfulness until received certain news from other side that have marched for orense a soon a breakfast be over cooking pot packed in cart two regiment started on march be in high spirit laughed sang a tramped along have lost two killed by french musketry fire there be five so severely wounded a to be unable to take place in rank terence ordered to be taken in country cart to pontelima provided with money for support there until cured men having be on foot night terence halted after doing fifteen mile on following morning soon after have started saw large body of french cavalry following road by river be la be who have be quartered at river here be narrower than have be below halting troop forming in line two three volley be fired across river did execution caused much confusion in french rank horseman however galloped rapidly up river be soon out of range settle question herrara french be retracing step bound for orense soult have not let grass grow under foot cavalry be evidently sent on to clear out band of peasant may be gathering at river la houssaye indeed twice in course of day broke up irregular band burned two village infantry artillery after passing through salvatierra moved by main road however be found to be so bad that artillery be with ten of sixteen light gun six howitzer left behind at tuy with great ammunition baggage train together with sick garrison of men be left in fort order be given that straggler be to be retained at place illustration french cavalry rode up towards square be met with heavy volley march of french be not unopposed when arrived at river morenta found spaniard have barricaded bridge repulsed advance party of cavalry on th at daybreak leading division attacked fiercely carried bridge pursued hotly until at short distance from ribadavia spaniard rallied upon irregular arrayed in order of battle in strong position covering town rest of division brigade of cavalry came up directed by soult attacked spaniard drove through town across avia with great loss twenty priest be found among slain next day three four thousand other irregular from valley of avia be attacked scattered on th french cavalry with three brigade of infantry entered orense hour earlier terence have arrived on other side of river have at once made preparation for blowing up bridge men have be short time at work when number of townsman streamed across bridge reported that great body of french be entering town terence have hasty consultation with herrara agreed that must not hope to hold bridge long against whole french army especially a have learned two hour before from peasant who have ridden up that strong body of french troop have crossed river by ferry at ribadavia barbibante that might shortly be attacked in flank powder barrel be therefore hastily repacked troop marched off towards hill on left be half way across plain when regiment of french cavalry be seen riding in pursuit regiment be at once formed into square within fifty yard of other terence bull in centre of one square herrara macwitty in other exhorted men to stand steady assuring there be nothing whatever to be feared from cavalry if did so french rode up towards square be met by heavy volley after riding round drew off having suffered considerable loss being greatly surprised at finding instead of mob of armed men such a have met at avia be encountered by soldier possessing steadiness of trained troop regiment resumed march until far up hill where proceeded to cut down tree brushwood to form encampment a leader have decided to stay here await event until soult intention be clearly shown there be two course open to french general might advance to allaritz then march along lima be joined by artillery train from tuy then move direct upon oporto might follow valley of tamega to chaves whence must have choice of route take that over sierra de cabrera to braga continue course down valley until reached douro be not until th of march that french again moved forward in meantime terence be forced to remain quiet except day marched men farther among hill drilled for hour perseveringly affair on minho repulse of french cavalry have given great confidence in leader have shown value of steadiness of maintaining order discipline in rank therefore devoted even more willingly zealously than before to military exercise ten day taken by soult in preparing for advance be well spent in accustoming portuguese to rapid movement among mountain to attaining fair knowledge of what must be required of in mountain warfare two company always remained in camp have several skirmish with body of french marauder small party of cavalry making across country to ascertain position strength of portuguese advance of french be rapid on th cavalry portion of infantry reached villa real where on evening of same day two division of infantry arrived that night terence with men having on th marched along hill parallel to road made forced march crossed road took up position on spur of mountain between montalegre river even yet be doubtful route soult intended to follow a division at villa real might be intended only to prevent romana silveira falling upon flank a marched down valley of lima have learned from romana that silveira have decided to fall back to chaves that agreed with terence opinion that have better remain in rear of french intercept communication with orense on following morning french advanced in force to monterey romana abandoned position a advanced drew off to verin then retired along road towards sanabria thus left open to to follow road to chaves a agreed upon to retire into spain through mountain franceschi cavalry battalion of french infantry overtook between two three thousand men forming rear of romana column latter drew up in great square franceschi attacked rear face with infantry passed with cavalry round side of square placed between rest of retiring column have with four regiment of cavalry now hurled regiment at side of square spaniard be at once seized with dismay broke formation in moment french cavalry be upon cutting trampling down twelve hundred be killed rest made prisoner a soon a romana heard of disaster have befallen rearguard broke engagement with silveira led force over mountain into spain where news of defeat caused spanish insurgent band to disperse rapidly to home where delivered up arm even priest who have be main promoter of rising seeing failure of plan advised to maintain peaceable attitude in future silveira be not more fortunate for two thousand of troop with gun issuing from mountain just a franceschi returned from annihilation of romana rearguard french cavalry charged captured portuguese gun drove silveira down valley soult paused two day at baggage hospital train great convoy of provision being brought up from orense under guard of whole division rendered evident that intended to cut off altogether from spain to subsist entirely upon country be clear then that be useless to attempt to fall upon rear by long march through mountain terence took force down to chaves here found that silveira deserted by romana beaten by franceschi have fallen back to mountain immediately behind chaves terence continued march until joined found great tumult going on among troop always insubordinate be now in state of mutiny many of officer openly advocated that must desist from struggle in success be altogether hopeless must go over join french troop however not only spurned advice fell upon killed several of who offered demanded from silveira that must lead down to defend chaves refused to do saying that fortification be old useless gun worn out be to shut up there must be surrounded forced to surrender refusal excited mutineer to highest pitch when terence arrived be clamouring for death small party of soldier who remained faithful to surrounded must speedily have be overpowered have not be for arrival of terence command a soon a understood what be happening formed men into solid body marched through excited crowd formed up in hollow square round general firm appearance of force fact that possessed more arm than whole of silveira army have effect mutineer however to number of determined to carry out intention at once marched away to chaves silveira remained with few hundred men a routed by franceschi have not rejoined owe life senor said to terence for mad fool must certainly have murdered be not surprising terence said mob of men who be not soldier can not be expected to observe discipline especially when insubordination anarchy have be absolutely fomented by authority crime of sort perpetrated by order effort made to punish ill doer men seem to be disciplined obedient silveira said have be taught to be so general believe that can rely upon absolutely if have officer discipline be certain that soldier must be excellent a be with few exception officer be worse than useless be appointed a reward for support of junta be ignorant of duty many of favour french regard soldier a raised not for defense of portugal for support of junta have seen enough to know that peasant be brave hardy ready to fight what can do when be half armed attempt be made to discipline have heard since trouble began of single man being shot for insubordination of single officer being punished even for grossest neglect of order be nothing short of murder to put mob of half armed peasant to stand against french troop be quite true silveira said heartily however will do best will doubt not soon have force collected for now that french have fairly entered portugal be marching towards capital man will take up arm senor what do mean to do will harass french a see opportunity will not subject men to certain disaster by joining of new levy know what men can do what can do with if mixed up with thousand of raw peasant must be swept away by latter share in misfortune might befall have seen of troop to day what saw of romana be quite enough to show that to lead peasant into field be simply to bring misfortune death upon far better that leader must collect two three hundred men teach discipline little drill instead of taking mob thousand strong out to battle men have marched down into chaves will will see offer resistance will simply be killed made prisoner to man now may ask if have store here general have have great difficulty in buying food up in mountain a will be useless to certainly can not be carried off must be glad to fill men haversack before go farther certainly have enough meat bread for whole force for week be welcome to take a much a require way do propose marching be waiting to see way french go after leaving chaves whether go down valley across mountain to braga will endeavour to get ahead of a men be splendid marcher have doubt that will succeed in doing so even if french have few hour start if can hing else can at least make cavalry keep together instead of riding in small party over country to sweep in food fire be soon lighted bullock killed cut up hearty meal eaten have already made very long march be ordered to lie down until nightfall silveira marched away with men terence herrara sat watched road down body of french troop must already be seen advancing from monterey towards chaves a approached town gun after gun be fired advance guard halted waited until whole division have come up chapter xvi in pass on following day french cavalry with division of infantry took up position beyond town so a to cut off retreat of garrison who be then summoned to surrender reply be made for next twenty four hour defender although in way attacked kept up random fire from gun on wall with musketry to reply be made by french on following day whole army having now come up town be again summoned at once surrendered when soult who did not wish to be hampered with mob of prisoner contemptuously allowed to depart to home after bringing up sick from chaves discovering that pass through mountain be unoccupied that portuguese army be at braga soult on th began to move in direction for purpose of crushing friere getting into communication with tuy being joined by artillery from there a soon a movement be seen from hill where terence regiment have be for three day resting preparation be made for marching with haversack well filled with bread meat troop started in good spirit terence procured service of peasant well acquainted with mountain be led by path used by shepherd across hill after twelve hour toilsome journey came down into defile that french be following there learned from peasant with exception of small scouting party two day before there be sign of hostile force men be at once set to work to destroy bridge across torrent at mouth of defile be built of stone be old in bad repair men have little difficulty in prising stone of side wall from place throwing down into stream party made hole over key of arch barrel of powder be placed here train having be laid be covered up by pile of rock third party formed barricade six foot high across end of bridge also two breastwork fifty yard away on side so a to flank approach to other end bridge troop be extended along hillside one battalion on side of defile under shelter of rock brush while preparation be being made horse be taken up to top of hill by path known to peasant of little village near mouth of defile woman child following terence herrara have consultation then former called bull macwitty to now said understand that while will defend defile a long a can will run risk of defeat might end in rout will inflict heavy loss upon before can repair bridge can certainly force cavalry to remain quiet until bring up infantry colonel herrara with one company of second battalion will hold village will sweep column advancing along bottom of defile with fire from flank while will also be exposed to fire in front when succeed in making way up to within charging distance will evacuate village join macwitty on hill must attack there on side for troop must march through until hillside be cleared be probable that may do before attempt to attack village in case must keep up steady fire until get within fifty yard of then retire up hill leave party to keep in check until rest have gained crest formed up in good order by time do will have driven in rear guard french will be breathless with exertion when reach wait till considerable number have gained crest then before have time to form pour heavy volley into charge then sweep with fire until reach bottom next time will doubt attack in much greater force in case will move quietly off without waiting for will reunite at village of romar five mile in rear if find a near that french be in possession will halt will send order to second regiment a to what be to be done if force be not too great will attack at night how will know where will be sir macwitty said have arranged with colonel herrara that when halt will light two fire short distance from other will reply by lighting one fire be then to be extinguished being arranged terence went down applied match to train then retired at run three minute later there be heavy explosion rock flew high in air when smoke cleared away cheer from hillside told that explosion have be successful terence returned to bridge considerable portion of arch have be blown away putting fifty men to work gap be soon carried across road widened so that there be chasm twelve foot across party who be to man breastwork be now posted terence took command here defender consisted of company of bull battalion hour later deep sound be heard a grew louder head of column of cavalry be seen approaching whole of force on hillside be hidden behind rock brushwood not head be shown above breastwork cavalry however halted officer with four men rode forward when within fifty yard of bridge volley of twenty musket flashed out from work behind officer three men fell other galloped back to main body have seen nothing beyond fact that there be breastwork across road franceschi thinking that have small force of peasant in front of ordered squadron to charge clear obstacle a before be allowed to approach to within fifty yard of bridge when from breastwork in front two side redoubt storm of musketry be poured into effect be terrible head of squadron be swept away few men charged forward until close to break in bridge most of fell few galloped back remains of squadron then trotted off in good order further movement took place for hour then body of infantry two thousand strong appeared a passed cavalry first two company be thrown out in skirmishing order be soon swarming down towards stream bank of although very steep be not impassable by infantry defender of two side redoubt spread out along bank a skirmisher approached opened fire for time rattle of firearm be incessant when main body of french infantry have a commander thought ascertained strength of defender advanced in solid order until near bridge then wheeled off on flank advanced with loud shout horn be sounded from hillside near scattering fire of musketry opened at once french however pushed forward without pause terence horn sounded again men fell back from bank whole company ran at full speed across narrow valley took place with comrade on hillside french crossed stream under heavy fire dividing into two portion prepared to assault hill simultaneously combat be obstinate french suffered heavily pushed way up unflinchingly portuguese encouraged by shout of officer held ground obstinately retreating only at sound of horn renewing combat short distance higher up being sheltered by rock behind lay loss be trifling in comparison to of french who be forced to expose a advanced whose number dwindled so rapidly that when way up be on side brought to stand still then taking shelter behind rock maintained contest on more equal term by time column of men be marching down to stream dividing like first climbed hill portuguese now fell back more rapidly fire slackened french with loud shout pressed up hill presently resistance ceased altogether firing a advanced at flying figure of whom caught occasional glimpse french pressed forward a rapidly a nature of ground must permit cheering loudly at last reached top of hill leader paused in doubt a saw before eleven twelve hundred men drawn up in line four deep at distance of fifty yard moment added to number of french a arrived officer tried to form into order when number about equalled of portuguese two heavy volley be poured into then with loud shout portuguese rushed at with levelled bayonet charge be irresistible french be hurled over crest went down hill carrying confusion dismay among climbing up portuguese pressed hotly giving time to rally forcing down to bottom of hill without check then at signal fell back to post that have held at beginning of fight success be equal on hillside regiment cheered other victory with shout rose high above roar of musketry with usual discipline french speedily rallied in spite of heavy fire that from side swept rank prepared when joined by regiment be approaching at double to assistance to renew assault terence saw that time odds must be too great to withstand horn sounded retreat portuguese turned to make way up hill just a french battery opened fire sheltered among rock infantry below be unconscious of movement for on side company have be left to continue fire until main body gained top of hill when too be summoned by horn to fall back wounded have be all taken up hill be laid in blanket carried off by comrade a two regiment marched away from crest of defile soldier be in highest spirit have repulsed with heavy loss french force of three time own strength greeted terence bull a rode together along column with enthusiastic cheer wounded in first battalion numbered forty three be despatched with party hundred strong to village four mile away among mountain regiment marched on until reached point agreed upon two men be sent forward to reconnoitre village returned with report that have already be occupied by very strong force of french cavalry hour later two wreath of smoke rose on opposite hill stick have be gathered in readiness answering signal be at once made two minute later smoke ceased to rise on side terence now received report of captain of six company found that fifteen men have be killed that strength be thus reduced by fifty eight men be now told that must lie down company keeping together so a to be ready for instant action trifling wound of there be two three twenty be then attended to bandaged of be quite serious enough to have warranted men falling out delight pride felt at success have be so great that have refused to be taken off with disabled comrade terence made round of troop addressed few word to company praising conduct thanking for readiness quickness with have obeyed order see lad said what can be done by discipline have not be for steady drill have have ever since marched must not have hoped to oppose french must not have ventured to have done so now see have proved that be a brave a enemy not only have beaten with heavy loss effect of fight will be to render more cautious in future slower in movement news of blow have struck will inspirit countryman everywhere having nothing else to do until after darkness fell terence after finishing round sat down added account of fight to report have written up at last halting place be written in duplicate one copy being intended for general cradock other for portuguese authority at oporto outpost have be thrown out towards village a soon a halted after opening haversack eating meal quenching thirst at little rivulet that ran down to village men lay down to sleep tired with long night march excitement of battle terence be exception to general rule for although have have horse yet for greater part of distance have marched on foot a ruggedness of ground traversed have in most place be too great to travel in safety on horseback in dark when night fell be on foot again refreshed by long sleep two men be now sent down to reconnoitre village again reported that be still occupied by cavalry infantry a must see by fire along road have bivouacked there one regiment at least have passed through village have occupied road ahead terence have already written out instruction to herrara in triplicate three men be despatched with be warned to be extremely careful for men who have first be sent have reported that french have posted sentry out on flank one of messenger be to make long detour to cross road mile ahead of french then to make way along on opposite hillside to spot where herrara be posted other two be to make way a best must through village piece of paper carried be rolled up into little ball be ordered that if noticed alarm given be at once to be swallowed soon after ten o'clock regiment formed up terence have given detailed order to captain of company be instructed to call up men twenty at time to explain order to so that man must know exactly what to do sound have be heard in village terence felt sure that herrara must have received order at quarter past ten with one company moved slowly down towards village bull with main body of force marching westward along hill six men have volunteered for service of silencing french outpost leaving musket behind stole forward in advance of company halted at little distance from french centre in quarter of hour returned eight french sentry have be surprised killed portuguese crawling up to until near enough to spring upon stab without slightest alarm being given company now moved silently forward again until within hundred yard of village when halted until church clock struck eleven then rushed down into village a entered shot be fired outcry rose from other side showing that herrara have managed matter a well a have surprise be complete street be full of horse while soldier have taken shelter in house scene of wildest confusion ensued horse be shot for be most important to cripple most formidable arm of french service men be attacked a poured out of house bull with hundred men made way straight to upper end of village repelled desperate attempt of squadron of horse be posted beyond in readiness for action to break through to assistance of comrade while terence herrara with hundred men held road at lower end of village to check infantry attack there be not long before be delivered french infantry disciplined veteran accustomed to surprise have sprung to foot when first shot be fired forming instantly into column came on at run led by officer terence with fifty men four deep barred way across road rest of men be stationed along high ground flanking on one side while herrara with hundred flanked opposite side a french came on portuguese on high ground remained silent unnoticed when flash of fire ran across road deadly volley be poured in upon enemy on flank at once opened fire for moment column paused in surprise then opened fire at unseen assailant whose fire be causing such gap in rank colonel several other officer who have be at head have fallen in din order must be heard for minute head of column wasted away under rain of bullet then general officer dashed up body of frenchman came along at run terence horn rang out loudly signal be repeated in village fire instantly ceased when french column rushed into place not foe be to be seen street be choked up by dead horse men reinforcement did not pause making way over obstacle pressed on to where roar of fire in front showed how hotly advance guard be engaged here surprise have be rather le complete of outpost have given alarm french be on foot before after pouring terrible volley into thousand men fell upon on side great number of french fell under fire long line be broken up into section by impetuous rush of portuguese nevertheless french soldier hung together combat raged desperately until head of relieving column came up then a suddenly a before attack ceased not gun be fired a if by magic assailant stole away into darkness while french opened random fire after hour later two portuguese regiment united on road two mile in advance of village loss have be eighty four killed hundred fifty wounded of seventy be serious case be a before sent off to be cared for in mountain village french loss a terence afterward heard have be very heavy three hundred of cavalry have be killed upwards of four hundred infantry great be enthusiasm when two regiment met after short halt marched away together into hill encamped in wood two mile from road what next generalissimo herrara whose left arm have be broken by bullet asked think that have done enough for present terence said will leave to rest of army to do little fighting now have lost in killed wounded two hundred men wish to see whole force dwindle away propose that go near braga have idea of putting under command of friere have seen enough of already so will travel by by road till get near oporto then will find out how matter stand there own idea be that when french army approach junta courage will ooze out of finger end that peasant call army will bolt at first attack of french so a mean to be trapped there will rest on laurel until see how matter go be well for corp terence abstained from joining army at braga a french entered pas of benda nova peasant rushed furiously down upon many broke into french column fighting desperately be slain survivor made way up hillside then making detour fell upon rear of column killed fifty straggler plundered baggage spontaneous action of peasant be only attempt made to bar advance of french friere permitted to pas through defile after defile without firing shot conduct aroused fury of troop feeling be fanned by agent of bishop who have now become jealous of men rushing upon dragged from house in have taken refuge slew fit end to career of man who have proved a unpatriotic a be incapable on th soult arrived near braga portuguese who be now commanded by eben german officer in british service drew up to meet french began advance on th hour later portuguese army be mob of fugitive vanquished army lost men gun only being taken prisoner rest dispersed in direction carrying tale of invincibility of french have not be for stout resistance offered by men placed on position in rear commanding road checked pursuit of cavalry enabled fugitive to make off scarce man of portuguese must have escaped to tell tale terence have approached oporto encamped in large wood when fugitive brought news of crushing defeat that have suffered soldier be so furious when heard of disgraceful rout that terence herrara have difficulty in preventing from killing fugitive result strengthened position troop on arriving at present camping place be eager to be led into oporto terence herrara have talked matter over several time agreed that step might be fatal standing a town did on north side of river only mean of leaving be bridge of boat if anything happened to retreat must be cut off defeat at braga at once confirmed opinion that army of peasant that bishop have gathered round oporto must be able to make little resistance to french attack must be terrible herrara said fugitive great portion of inhabitant of town struggling to cross bridge with french cavalry pressing on rear french artillery playing upon be not to be thought of troop however have be full of confidence in valour of countryman from own success against french believed that army at braga must certainly defeat soult there have be dissatisfaction that have not be permitted to take part in victory news brought by fugitive at once dissipated hope that have entertained saw that commander have acted wisely in refusing to join army there feeling of contempt for undisciplined ordenancas peasant equalled confidence have before reposed in terence ordered two regiment to form into hollow square addressed soldier said know that be disappointment to that did not take to braga have done so not one of must have escaped for when rest fled like flock of sheep must not alone have withstood attack of whole french army know that wish to enter oporto have withstood that wish now must see be right in doing so peasant gathered in defence be even le disciplined than at braga soult will after two three minute fighting capture place be there must not prevent such result might hold spot at be stationed if french broke in at other point must be surrounded killed to man what use must be to portugal can do more good by living fighting day even if must fall back with other fugitive what chance of safety must there be know that there be one bridge of boat across river will soon be blocked by panic stricken crowd chance of crossing must be slight indeed men who fought at braga men who will fight before oporto be more coward than be have gained a much discipline a have must march down with at once join in defence mob can not withstand disciplined troop when portuguese have learned to be soldier may fight with hope of success until then be taking to slaughter to set in line of battle against french soult may be here in twenty four hour therefore propose to march down to river above oporto be sure to find boat there will cross at once to other side encamp near suburb at south end of bridge when fugitive pour over will take station there cover retreat prevent french from crossing in pursuit murmur of satisfaction broke from soldier swelled into shout soon after evening fell corp marched from wood two hour later came down on bank of douro a terence anticipated there be plenty of fisherman boat hauled up regiment passed over by company by three in morning be across by five encamped in wood beyond steep hill rising behind villa nova suburb on left bank of river a soon a have seen soldier settled terence borrowed clothes of one of men putting on instead of uniform sent for bull macwitty two soldier soon arrived looked in astonishment at officer be going into town said partly to judge for myself of state of thing there partly on little private business of own be possible may get into trouble hope that will not do so be a well to be prepared for emergency might happen if then return be to look to colonel herrara for order when french enter oporto be certain will do a soon a attack may gather men at end of bridge cover retreat repulse effort of french to cross a soon a attempt have ceased will march with two regiment for coimbra report yourselves to officer commanding there here be despatch to general in have done full justice to bravery conduct here be also note to officer commanding at coimbra have spoken to about conduct have asked to allow to continue with portuguese until order be received from sir john cradock have given colonel herrara duplicate of despatch official order in case must be killed can not go with sir bull asked think so bull dress a might must hardly be taken for anything englishman walk complexion to say nothing of hair must betray at once first person who happened to address must discover that be not native chance be must denounce that must be torn to piece before must offer explanation now think that can pas readily enough wind rough weather have brought to nearly right colour know how to speak portuguese well enough to ask question without exciting suspicion why not take two of men with macwitty said must do talking be necessary must anyone suggest that be not native must declare that be comrade from own village bull strongly approved of suggestion terence though in respect must rather have be alone at last agreed to may a well take arm not for use to give appearance of two men from camp who have come down to make purchase in city daylight be just breaking a three crossed bridge of boat into town passed through up hill to great camp have be established there covered large extent of ground contained tent sufficient for whole of men assembled short distance away be line of intrenchment on peasant have be for week engaged consisted of fort crowning succession of rounded hill connected by earthen rampart loopholed house ditch abattis of felled tree no le than two hundred gun be in place on fort be position that two thousand good troop must have be able to hold against army be strong position terence said to two men with yes french can never pas that one of said exultingly that will see ought not to certainly whether will not be matter wandered about for couple of hour once one of portuguese joined group of peasant learned from something of state of thing in town representing that have just arrived be lucky will see how will destroy french army gun will sweep away man in town be full of confidence traitor be trembling in house when news of business at braga came yesterday learned treachery of general people rose dragged fifteen suspected men of rank from prison killed there be not day that of traitor be not rooted out be well other said be traitor have brought to pas will see how will fight when french come bishop have promised to come out in robe to give blessing to call down wrath of heaven on french infidel after having finished survey of line terence returned to city following instruction that have received a to situation of convent at santa maria be not long in finding be massive building window of two lower story be closely barred must not see way of opening communication with cousin of devising way of escape however thought that might possibly be managed if must send in rope to pulley with mean of fixing in way must lower to ground must be very difficult to manage even if have ample time at disposal in present circumstance be altogether impossible stared at house for long time in silence idea came to be with feeling of hopelessness that recrossed bridge rejoined troop be glad to see back sir bull said heartily have be in funk morning that something might happen to have gone off quietly will now tell macwitty what business here be may need help be matter in none of portuguese must dare to offer assistance think must do maist anything for sir mac witty said have confidence in must go through fire water if be to lead must do almost anything what want done now have cousin young lady who be heiress to large fortune father be dead mother wealthy land owner have have shut up in convent where be trying to force against will to become nun be kept prisoner on bread water until consent to sign paper surrendering right now what want to do be to get out can not be done by force be out of question be strong building even if men must consent to attack convent must not do town must be up must have whole populace on so force be out of question now french be sure to take place when do there will be awful scene will be furious at resistance have met with at loss that have suffered will be maddened reasonably by frightful torture inflicted upon prisoner who have fallen into hand of portuguese may be sure that for time quarter will be given soldier will be let loose upon city there will be no more respect for convent than dwelling house may imagine how frightfully anxious be if have not be for french must have let matter stand until army entered oporto a be must try do something a far a can see only chance will be in frightful confusion will take place when french enter town will stand by mr o'connor may be sure have only got to tell to do may trust to do macwitty who be man of few word nodded mr o'connor know that said thank terence said heartily must think out plan when have decided upon will let know chapter xvii escape during visit to other side of river terence have seen with great satisfaction that powerful battery mounting fifty gun have be erected on height of villa nova fire thought must effectually bar attempt of french to cross bridge must indeed be madness for to attempt such operation a boat supporting bridge must be instantly sunk by concentrated fire of battery said nothing of on return to camp a might have given rise to fresh agitation among men be to be aware that presence be not really required for defence of bridge after short stay in camp again went down into town with idea that be more likely to hit upon plan of action there than must be in camp two men again went with prolonged stare at convent failed to inspire with scheme be in slightest degree practicable fell back upon conclusion have mentioned to two trooper that only chance must be to take advantage of wild confusion must prevail upon entry of french difficulty presented to be that nun must be so appalled by approach of french that must be unlikely that must think of leaving protection such a be of convent must shrink from encountering wild turmoil in street even if did so must be too late for to have chance of getting across bridge must be thronged to point of suffocation by mob of fugitive might readily be destroyed by one two of boat being sunk by french artillery one thing evident be that must arrange to get boat to station at end of street going down to river from neighbourhood of convent that part of city being distance from bridge street must soon be deserted there must not be wild rush of fugitive to boat must be case be to be lying alongside anywhere near bridge upon other hand must be le likely that nun must leave convent if be comparatively quiet in neighbourhood did do so must be difficult in extreme to carry off cousin from midst ignorant too a be of appearance after looking for time at convent returned to more busy part of town presently heard great shouting window opened saw crowd coming along street by candle banner crucifix canopy be evident that be religious procession be about to turn off into side street when thought struck that possibly be bishop on way up to camp therefore remained in place doffed hat like around went down on one knee procession be long stately one in midst walking beneath canopy came bishop terence gazed at fixedly in order to impress on mind feature of man whose ambition have cost portugal so dearly at whose instigation so much blood of most honest capable men of province have be shed face fully justified idea that have formed of man bishop be of commanding presence walked with air of one who be accustomed to see bow before on other hand face bore trace of violent character there be set smile on lip brow be heavy frowning while receding chin contradicted strength of upper part of face there be too look of anxiety restlessness betrayed by nervous twitching of lip scoundrel be coward terence said to may profess absolute confidence think feel will bet odds that wo be in front when time for fighting come terence walked away after procession have passed if one must get hold of bishop said to one might get order on superior of convent to hand over mary o'connor to bearer see how can possibly be managed of course be surrounded by priest official day palace will be guarded by number of soldier for must have many enemy there must be score of relative of men who have be killed by order who must assassinate bishop though be have chance even if got order seems to impossible to do so must not be made out in name of mary o'connor know that change name when go into nunnery may be sister angela cecilia anything else must not know in slightest degree whether name put down be one really go by idea be out of question returning to camp held counsel with latter knew have none of bigotry so general among countryman have before told about cousin being shut up against will of letter that have thrown out have hitherto said nothing of intention to bring about escape if possible have idea that be what be in mind when went off so early morning o'connor have high respect for church have respect for abuse shutting up of young lady forcing to take veil in order to rob of property be a hateful to a can be to so must have hesitation in aiding in endeavour to bring about escape have formed plan have thought over again again can not think of scheme if be case o'connor fear that be useless for to try to do so be so full of idea always that if can not see way out of difficulty be hopeless to expect must do so if can contrive plan will promise to aid in way can point out a to inventing one must never do so if racked brain ever so much there must be way terence said used to get into sort of scrape when be boy found there be always way out of if one must hit upon only thing can think of be to carry off in confusion when french enter town must say that nun must never think of leaving convent o'connor be best hope of safety to remain there doubt be french always respect convent very much contrary indeed think that must go out merely to rush into street might go out if thought must get over bridge before french arrived might do that certainly indeed must be best thing must do do think that if one be to dress up a priest a one of bishop attendant to go a from with order to lady superior to take nun at once across bridge to convent on other side must obey not without written order herrara said bishop must naturally send someone who must be known to if did send stranger must give letter token must recognize otherwise must not know that be order be what be afraid of herrara be what will try if can see other way indeed see only one chance of getting over difficulty bishop be tyrant of worst kind now a far a can remember tyrant of sort be to say tyrant who rule by working on passion of mob be always coward watched bishop closely when saw to day be convinced be one also even in kneeling crowd must not conceal there be nervous twitching about lip to mind showed that be in state of intense anxiety that under swagger show of confidence be nevertheless in horrible state of alarm that being so seems to extremely likely that when fighting begin will make bolt of wo wait for french to enter for must know well enough that in fury at defeat fugitive if came upon must be likely to tear limb from limb just a have murdered dozen of infinitely better men so think that will make off beforehand imagine that will go secretly with only two three attendant must never carry off without alarm being raised if be what be thinking of o ' connor be not thinking of if must say with bull macwitty suddenly attack like three robber might carry off something must serve a sort of passport to lady abbess for instance have tremendously big ring on noticed a held up hand a if on purpose to show off be episcopal ring herrara laughed yes if must get hold of that must be key must open door of convent do think must hand cousin over to if showed to gave message a from bishop yes if knew name see from day be made nun lost former name altogether certainly bishop must send for under convent name be what be thinking then must get out have got to get ring first herrara said with smile yes yes mean if get if french have entered town can never get across bridge know mean to get boat have lying off end of quiet street must put couple of men into for must only regard when have got on board a effort on part to save one of nun from french one thing to do must be to get robe of priest dress of one of bishop official herrara thought for time think must do for o'connor of course have good many acquaintance in oporto among lady be intending to go across evening see of implore to leave town before be too late one of friend of mine might buy robe for woman can do sort of thing when man can not can pretend that want to buy robe a present for parish priest father confessor something of sort at rate be worth trying be indeed herrara if must manage must be greatly obliged to will go across at once expect soult will be close up to morrow morning at rate next day may be couple of day before get whole force concentrated in four day anyhow shot will be rattling down into town will go see what can do have better get one of trooper to get boat for herrara did not return until early on following morning have managed said a terence who be getting very anxious about ran forward to meet there be one family in oporto whose eldest son be brother officer of mine have visited here with have met several time at lisbon indeed may tell frankly that have not be for trouble sister must ere time have be affianced to have hoped that have left town before told that movement of sort might bring disaster on two of brother be in army bishop must not therefore pretend that father be traitor to country being elderly man latter have in fact held aloof altogether from politics be certainly not of bishop party bishop considers that who be not with be against have attempted to leave town there be doubt must have made pretext for arresting father must certainly do so on first opportunity however quite believed that great force that there be here must be sufficient to defend fortification be completely taken aback when told be absolutely convinced that place must fall at first attack of french agreed to make preparation for leaving at once horse have be seized nominally that must be used on fortification really have doubt to prevent leaving of course told about what have be doing in be intensely interested for aught know house may be watched so will come out in of servant clothes told that must leave on night before soult made attack of course will summon town bishop will of course refuse to surrender may be sure french will attack on following day left alone with lorenza for time took opportunity of telling about plan what wanted promised to procure dress of ecclesiastic to morrow told that be about size height knew cousin personally be very fond of therefore entered more readily into plan to get out said that disappeared suddenly month ago that mother have given out that have be suddenly seized with determination to enter convent much against own wish lorenza felt sure that be not true for knew that cousin have heard from father much about reformed religion be in heart disposed way mother be engaged to be married to nobleman who be one of bishop warmest supporter general idea be that mary o'connor have be forced into nunnery against will sat talking with until late last night must not hear of leaving especially a said that town be full of band of ruffian who traversed street attacking robbing anyone of respectable appearance a have rather fancy to try what comfortable bed be like again did not need much pressing thank greatly herrara be indeed obliged to thing seem to look really hopeful have arranged with bull macwitty on evening before attack be likely to take place will watch night at end of bridge bishop wo leave until last thing must wager money will do so that night wo go farther than villa nova so a to be ready to cross again at once if news come that french have be beaten off doubt will make excuse that a ecclesiastic must take active part in defence have be engaged in prayer have done more towards gaining victory than presence must possibly have done must not be surprised if must be course herrara said smiling at rate for sake hope that will be have seen about boat yes spoke to francesco nortis yesterday evening told that wanted to hire boat with two boatman for next week be to be at service night day be to tell that must not want for fishing that in case by possibility french took town must be able to go across bring friend over when told that money be object said that there must be difficulty about will be glad enough to get good week pay next to nothing to do for two day passed quietly on first day news arrived that silveira have invested chaves on day of battle of braga have forced garrison consisted of hundred fighting men with twelve hundred sick to capitulate day after day news came of advance of french have moved in three column have met with stout resistance have carried pass bridge after severe loss one of column have be held for time in check at ponte d'ave have carried at last whereupon portuguese have murdered general dispersed on th six day after battle of braga franceschi cavalry be seen approaching position in front of oporto alarm bell rung troop hurried to position day passed off quietly confidence of people being still further raised by arrival of regular troop sent by beresford to assistance a there be already seven eight thousand regular troop in camp seemed to that a soult have men fit for action defence ought to be held against for length of time majority indeed believed that must not even venture to attack town when upon arrival perceived strength especially when knew that have few gun with park of artillery being still at tuy be closely invested by spaniard on following day whole french army settled down in front of portuguese work wild purposeless fire be now opened by defender although french be far beyond musket range soult sent in message to bishop urging to surrender assured that resistance be hopeless that be earnest desire to save so great city from horror of storm message be sent by prisoner who be seized by mob in spite of flag of truce that carried must have be murdered have not assured people that came with message from soult to effect that seeing hopelessness of attacking town of marching back to frontier in safety wished to negotiate for surrender for army at one point portuguese displayed white flag shouted that wished to surrender french general advanced with officer when reached line portuguese fell upon killed companion carried general prisoner into town negotiation be prolonged until evening bishop declined soult overture fire from intrenchment continued in course of evening merle division in order to divert attention from point soult have fixed upon for attack moved towards portuguese left when tremendous fire of artillery musketry opened upon division made way forward occupied hollow ground shielded from fire within very short distance of intrenchment feeling that crisis be at hand terence have everything prepared boatman be told that might be required that night that be to have boat in readiness to start at moment herrara have warned friend went to house with six of men a soon a became dusk to escort over terence with two trooper clad in dress of two of tallest of men wrapped in cloak with broad hat pressed low down upon forehead went down to end of bridge a soon a became quite dark river be three hundred yard broad sound of confusion alarm prevailed in city must be plainly heard although evening have set in rough tempestuous shout of excited mob mingled with clanging of church bell that doe not sound like confidence in victory terence remarked quite other way sir must say that after bragging man in place be in blue funk great many people especially woman with child be making way across bridge about nine o'clock little knot of five six men following tall figure passed be bishop terence whispered in pursuance of order that have previously given two men followed a fell in at short distance behind group turned off from main road took one led up to serra convent standing on crest of rugged hill a soon a have passed beyond house at foot of hill road be altogether deserted terence said to men now be time do take attendant will manage bishop moved forward quickly silently until be close to group then dashed forward a startled attendant turned round trooper fell upon with heavy blow from fist knocked to ground like nine pin bishop turned round shouted villain be bishop know that terence exclaimed sprang at prelate reeled fell terence threw upon seizing hand wrested from episcopal ring then upon seeing that bishop have fainted probably from fright terence leapt to foot five attendant be lying on ground right lad said have got what wanted just strip off one of fellow clothes take one be priest took minute for two trooper to strip off garment pick up three cornered hat now come along men reached house again without hearing so much a cry from astounded portuguese who a yet have vague idea of what have happened to capture of clothes have be rendered necessary by herrara report two day before that young lady have failed to get clothes for shopman have asked so many question concerning that have said carelessly that made matter have intended to give a present surprise a there seemed difficulty about must give money instead let priest choose own clothes have purposely entered shop in opposite end of town from in father lived so that there must be le chance of being recognized herrara said that must try elsewhere terence at once begged to tell not to do so bishop be sure to have of priest with said if rob of ring might just a well rob one of of clothes on returning to camp terence found that comrade have already arrived with gentleman three lady tent have be given up for use of latter herrara have warned not to say word to old gentleman of adventure others know nothing about said be just a well that must for be somewhat rigid in notion might be rather horrified at assaulting bishop however great scoundrel might be must be specially so at borrowing of ring at twelve o'clock heavy peal of thunder be heard followed by tremendous outbreak of firing from intrenchment two hundred gun terrific musketry fire opening suddenly french be attacking herrara exclaimed think so terence replied be more likely to be false alarm troop may have thought that thunder be roar of french gun soult must hardly make attack at night not knowing nature of ground behind intrenchment men must be falling into confusion perhaps fire into other a after quarter of hour of prodigious din fire slackened presently ceased altogether be evident that supposition be correct one morning broke bright still hour later cannonade began again terence at once after telling herrara to form troop up march down to end of bridge left camp after proceeding short distance took off uniform donned attire of ecclesiastic then hurried down into town be accompanied by two trooper in peasant dress left at bridge din be now tremendous church bell be ringing furiously frightened woman be already crowding down towards bridge point of crossing have already be decided upon be at end of street close to convent when terence reached convent two men be already standing at end of street awaiting now do part of business will do mine terence said moved forward to door of convent where must be unseen must anyone look out two trooper went to middle of street opposite window officer have described to terence shouted in stentorian voice mary o'connor shout be heard above tumult of battle din in city head appeared at window looked down with bewildered expression mary o'connor bull shouted again friend be here to rescue will leave convent directly with rest look out for then walked on passed terence have seen face have sir will know again never fear terence now seized bell rung vigorously door opened terrified face appeared at window have message from bishop to lady superior door be opened be at once closed barred behind be led along passage to room where lady superior pale agitated be awaiting have french entered intrenchment asked trust have not entered yet may do so at moment bishop be at serra convent from there have view over town to intrenchment begs to instantly bring nun across for will be in safety there whereas one can say what may happen in town here be episcopal ring in proof be bearer of order pray to hasten sister for crowd of fugitive be already pouring over bridge there be not moment to be lost nun be just coming down to prayer in chapel will start instantly in two minute upward of hundred frightened woman be gathered in courtyard be here terence asked lady superior of asked because know that be specially anxious that one who be sort of prisoner must not fall into hand of french a might cause serious trouble know whom mean called out sister theresa there be answer illustration macwitty be standing covering two boatman with pistol be well asked said have forgotten gave order to one of sister who at once entered house returned in minute with young nun door be now opened moved out in procession terence must hear regular volley amidst roar of gun incessant crack of musket fear that have entered intrenchment said hasten sister will be too late with hurried step passed along deserted street a neared bridge crowd of fugitive be hastening in direction when approached head found blocked by struggling mass what be to be done lady superior asked in consternation must wait minute two may clear off second crowd increased be soon thick behind already line of nun be broken up by pressure terence have kept eye on two tall figure who have followed at first behind have then quickened footstep until abreast of centre of line to satisfaction saw that have one of nun between be forcing way with through crowd behind at moment terrible cry arose from crowd troop of portuguese dragoon rode furiously down street leading to bridge dashed into crowd trampling down in way in reckless terror until gained end of bridge a rode on to two of boat already low in water from weight upon gave surge sank carrying with hundred of people crowd recoiled with cry of horror there be escape now sister terence said go back to convent home sister cried in loud shrill voice made heard even over scream of drowning people wail cry of mob terence placed before lady superior by main force made way through crowd be more easy a seeing only escape cut off number be now beginning to disperse to home movement be converted into wild rush when troop of french cavalry came thundering down to bridge in moment be mad confusion fright nun followed superior thought of decorum being now lost fled with like flock of frightened sheep along street leading to convent terence paused moment saw that french trooper threw from horse animosity being for moment forgotten in horror of scene set to work to endeavour to save drowning wretch regardless of fire a soon a french appeared be opened by battery on height of villa nova then sped away after nun whom soon passed turned down street next to convent on reaching end saw two trooper with nun in boat ten yard away macwitty be standing covering two boatman with pistol row back to shore again roared out in english take off gentleman there men did not understand word understood gesture stroke two took alongside terence leapt in told men to row across river be unexpected meeting cousin said to girl have be telling who be how have effected rescue said bursting into tear how can thank well be hardly time for thanks said be a glad a be that have turned out well will tell about a soon a be across be nearly over when exclaimed to trooper french have repaired bridge with plank see be crossing sprang out on reaching opposite shore moment later rattle of musketry broke out macwitty said will give young lady into charge take straight up to camp there be three lady there said to cousin in tent have clothes for to change into will not be long before will rejoin must join regiment now be engaged with enemy a hurried along with bull must hear above sound of musketry sharp crack of field gun from opposite side of river be covering passage bull a came up found that herrara have taken possession of house near end of bridge part of troop filled window while main body lined quay french be recoiling mass of troop must be seen at further end of bridge two field battery be keeping up incessant fire herrara be posted with company at end of bridge have better fall back herrara before form fresh column of attack might repulse again will be able to cross by boat elsewhere will be taken in front rear let draw off in good order infantry will be sure to march straight against battery on hill behind will be hour before cavalry can cross by time will be well on way whereas if stop here until be taken in flank rear will be cut to piece quite agree with herrara said ordered man with horn standing beside to sound retreat men near at once formed up got in motion in house poured out in two minute whole force be going up hill at trot still preserving order five minute later head of french column poured over bridge just a troop reached place of encampment fire of battery ceased suddenly chapter xviii mary o'connor never be large force of men driven from very strong position carefully prepared defended by vast number of gun so quickly easily a be portuguese before oporto bishop after rejecting soult summons disregarding prayer to save city from ruin suddenly lost heart after boasting slipped away after dark to serra convent leaving command to general of army feint soult have made with merle division night before against portuguese left succeeded perfectly portuguese massing force on side to resist expected attack soult real intention however be to break through centre of line then to drive portuguese right left away from town while pushed body of troop straight through city to seize bridge thus cut off retreat accordingly commenced attack on wing portuguese weakened centre to meet then central division of french rushed forward burst through intrenchment carried at once two principal fort then two battalion marched into town made for bridge while rest fell on portuguese rear french right carried in succession number of fort took fifty piece of artillery drove off great mass of portuguese from town while merle met with equal success on other flank portuguese therefore be driven up valley of douro other half down towards sea maddened by terror of strove to swim across others to get over in small boat lima general shouted to that river be too wide to swim that who took to boat must be shot down by pursuing french whereupon own troop turned upon murdered although french be couple of hundred yard away then renewed attempt to cross many perished similar scene took place in valley above town here french cavalry interposed between panic stricken fugitive river so prevented throwing away life in hopeless attempt to swim across in meantime incessant firing be going on in city french column arriving at bridge after doing best to rescue drowning people sacrificed to heartless cowardice of portuguese cavalry speedily repaired break caused by sinking boat prepared to cross river while others scattered through town inhabitant fired upon from roof window two hundred men defended bishop palace to last house be scene of conflict french on entering one of principal square found number of comrade who have be taken prisoner sent to town still alive horribly mutilated of having be blinded others having leg cut off mutilated in various way terrible sight naturally goaded to such state of fury that soult in vain endeavoured to stop work of slaughter pillage continued for several hour altogether number of portuguese who perished by drowning slaughter in street be estimated at ten thousand of number killed in defence of work formed insignificant portion terence on arrival at camp in wood resumed uniform herrara have on previous day purchased light waggon two horse for use of lady a soon a men have strapped on cloak blanket have left behind when advanced to defence of bridge retreat began not until have seen column fairly on way did terence ride up to speak to occupant of waggon have not be introduced by herrara to friend for on return from encounter with bishop lady have already retired to tent must introduce to don jose be terence o connor ensign in britannic majesty regiment of mayo fusilier aide de camp of general cradock very humble personage though at present in command of troop irregular regiment of portuguese army lieutenant herrara have told so much about senor o'connor that have be looking forward with much pleasure to meeting allow to present to wife daughter who have be a anxious a to meet officer who have done such good service to cause to whom be due at present moment that be here instead of being in midst of terrible scene be doubt at moment being enacted in oporto terence bowed deeply to lady then said to cousin almost require introducing to for caught glimpse of a crossed river look so different now that have got rid of hideous attire think must have known have changed greatly too senor o'connor terence burst into laugh dear cousin be evident that know very little of english custom though speak english so well call cousin mr miss will have to call terence will certainly call mary macwitty brought back to camp right yes be terrible to hear that firing be wondering time whether be being hurt there be great deal of powder fired away to one get hit do know what have happened in town don jose asked know no more than what cousin have doubt told of terrible scene at bridge be evident that french burst through line without difficulty a saw soldier except cowardly cavalryman before french arrived be probable that intrenchment be carried in centre soult evidently sent body of soldier straight through town to secure bridge think must have cut off main body of defender of intrenchment from entering town must either have captured driven off fire of cannon have ceased over there before retired be clear from that that whole of intrenchment must have be captured there be however heavy rattle of musketry in town suppose that house perhaps barricade be being defended be mad thing to do for must only excite fury of french troop get out of hand altogether if there have be resistance column might have marched in in good order even then fear there might have be trouble for unfortunately peasant have behaved with such merciless cruelty to straggler who fell into hand that thirst for vengeance must in case have be irrepressible still officer might possibly have preserved order have there be resistance will be pursued do think senor don jose wife asked think so possibly party of horse may scour country for distance round to see if there be body of troop here be too strong to be attacked by very numerous body of horse if must attempt may be sure that can render very good account of have beaten off french horse once a since then have have stiff fighting have fear of men being unsteady even if franceschi cavalry came down upon of however there will be little chance french have hand full for day few scouting party be that be likely to send out speak portuguese very well terence mary o'connor said in language hesitating little before used christian name have be nearly nine month in country during most of have be on staff have have to communicate with peasant others for past two month have spoken nothing else necessity be good teacher besides lieutenant herrara have be good enough to take great pain in correcting mistake teaching proper idiom six month of work have doubt will be able to pas a native after marching fifteen mile column halted terence feeling assured that french must not push out scouting party more than three four mile from villa nova halted at edge of forest party under one of officer be at once despatched to village two mile away returned in hour with drove of pig have be bought there cart laden with bread wine fire have already be lighted after seeing that ration be divided among various company went to tent herrara be chatting with friend

broken how did get not with bishop good will may be sure mary terence laughed then told how have become possessed of girl looked quite scared sound dreadful doe mary to think must have laid hand upon bishop bishop man who regard a greatest in portugal however there be other way of getting ring must not see how without must persuade lady superior to leave convent with to tell truth must rather have got that way than other bishop be in opinion man who deserves respect have terrorized north of portugal have caused score of better men than to be imprisoned put to death have now by folly ignorance cost life of one know how many thousand men brought about sack of oporto did hear anything of mother girl asked portuguese be not good enough for to ask question without risking being detected a foreigner at once have behaved shamefully to mary never liked girl said simply father never got on well together think dislike began by taking to liking to be with getting to talk english there be terrible quarrel between once because accused of teaching to be protestant although never did so did give bible used to ask question answered be a did seem to that be much wiser in thing than be

dinner at six o'clock want twenty minute of time now be shocking according to portuguese idea said demurely for young lady gentleman to be talking together for nearly three hour without anyone to look after be not at shocking according to irish idea terence said laughing especially when young lady gentleman happen to be cousin walked short time in silence then said have obeyed terence have uttered word of thanks for what have done for show that be good girl terence laughed good girl always do a be told at least be supposed to though a to fact never have experience for have sister there be girl in barrack still be glad that kept promise hope that will always do so being cousin of course be natural must try to rescue must not if have be cousin say that dare say must have tried same if have heard that english irish girl be shut up here be sure must if have seen beforehand coloured little at compliment said lightly father told once irishman be great hand at compliment told that there be stone people went to old castle to kiss think that called blarney stone after that be able to say sort of absurd thing have never kissed blarney stone terence said laughing if wanted to kiss anything must be something good deal softer than that be now entering camp in few minute arrived at tent began to think that be lost o'connor herrara said a came up have lot to talk about terence replied cousin have be insisting upon telling whole history about what have passed here since be shut up year ago a may imagine be rather long story few minute later sat down on ground to meal in roast pork be leading feature be what call in england picnic senora terence said to don jose wife picnic repeated what doe that mean be funny word have idea why must be called so terence said mean open air party lady be supposed to bring provision gentleman wine sometimes be boating party at other time drive in carriage to spot agreed upon be always very jolly much better than formal meal indoors can play sort of trick what sort of trick senor oh there be lot of be always having fun before became officer father be one of captain of regiment be generally in for amusement that there be once at picnic remember got hold of salt cellar mustard pot beforehand filled up one with powdered epsom salt be horribly nasty know mixed mustard with cayenne pepper nobody must make out what have happened to food soon suspected mustard nobody thought of salt for long time colonel be furious over fortunately must not prove have hand in matter though know that suspected for did not get invitation to picnic for long time afterwards three girl laughed don jose said seriously must have got into terrible trouble if have be found out must not must have got licking doubt senor be pretty accustomed to did not trouble in way at rate did not cure of love for mischief be afraid never will be cured of used to have end of fun in regiment think that did good take thinking to work out bit of mischief properly suppose if one can think one thing out well one can think out seems to have succeeded well in case anyhow herrara laughed perhaps if have not be for playing that trick at picnic must never have taken command of mob must never have gone to oporto friend cousin must be there now be if have not be killed may have have something to do with terence admitted now senor don jose said way be going to take will go straight on to coimbra terence said unless come upon british force before two long day march will take there after must do a be ordered independent command will come to end there hope that will soon hear that regiment have returned from england what be to become of have not thought of asking mary o'connor said that must depend upon circumstance mary if go down to lisbon hope that will travel together can then put on board transport returning to england be sure to find letter from father there telling where be whether be coming back with regiment will be very happy senor don jose said courteously to take charge of senora until there be opportunity for sending to england have of course many friend in lisbon will take house there instant arrive donna o'connor will be a one of own family be extremely obliged to don jose have be wondering day a rode along what must do with cousin if a be probable be obliged to stay at coimbra until receive order from lisbon kind offer relief of great anxiety think that will be prudent for to take name while be at lisbon there will certainly be inquiry after for lady superior of convent will of course conclude that be accidentally separated from others in crush that be trampled on killed indeed there will be such confusion in oporto that loss of nun more le must fail to attract attention at rate be likely to be long time before report lady superior will make to bishop will reach month perhaps for be not likely to take particular pain to tell news must certainly anger still if go to lisbon a doubt will by chance happens to hear that miss o'connor be one of who have escaped from sack of oporto might make inquiry then sort of trouble might arise even if did not have carried off by force must be easy enough in place so disturbed a lisbon at present be think that be right senor don jose said gravely at rate must be a well to avoid risk what name will call can call miss dillon senor be name of officer in regiment bishop might meet in street by chance what then think that must know mary o'connor put in have seen suppose that ever noticed until saw in nun dress of course look very different now still be very sharp will take good care never to go out without veil will be safest plan mary terence said though think anyone must recognize of course supposes that be still snugly shut up in convent still be just a well not to run slightest risk made two long march reached coimbra early on third morning bringing first news have be received there of storming of oporto terence at once reported to commanding officer be wondering where two regiment came from mr o'connor colonel said watched march in thought that be most orderly body have seen since came out here whose corp be well colonel be corp will tell about presently be long story how strong be field state morning made two thousand three hundred fifty five be two thousand five hundred to begin with rest be killed wounded oh have have fighting then have have share at rate colonel think can venture to say that other portuguese corp show so good record have large number of tent in store will order sufficient number to be served out to put men under canvas with understanding that if army advance way tent must be handed back to there be quantity of uniform also there have be ship load sent over for use of portuguese militia who be to turn out in hundred of thousand who have yet to be discovered must like of very much indeed colonel must add very greatly to appearance though a far a fighting go be bound to say must wish nothing better really then can say be have made very valuable discovery hitherto fighting power of portuguese have be invisible to naked eye if have found that really will fight under circumstance may hope that now lord beresford have come out to take command of portuguese army be going to have certain number of british officer to train command will be of utility instead of being simply scourge to country constant drain on purse have heard that oporto be captured sir say so captured in le than hour from time that first gun be fired just what expected when have political bishop who not only pretend to govern country also assume command of army how can be otherwise however will tell about presently will go down with at once to store order issue of tent uniform order be that uniform be to be served out to militia ordenancas under head do men come latter sir be what really be hung three men junta sent to command placed in hand have done best must with with assistance of lieutenant herrara who a may remember accompanied in charge of escort own two trooper men between have really done much in way of disciplining two hour later tent be pitched on spot mile distant from town by time that be done cart with uniform came up to great delight of men have to go to commandant again now herrara let uniform be served out to men at once tell captain to see to fitting a well a possible have doubt that colonel will come down to inspect afternoon will probably bring good many officer with so must make a good show a possible herrara friend mary o'connor have on arriving at coimbra hired room a don jose have determined to stay for few day before going on because wife have be much shaken by event have taken place eldest daughter be naturally anxious to wait until knew whether herrara must be able to return to lisbon must remain with corp by time terence returned to colonel quarter be lunch time must come across to mess mr o'connor commandant said everyone be anxious to hear news will save going over twice if will tell after lunch fancy officer in camp will be there chapter xix confirmed in command terence after lunch be over first related to officer that knew of siege of oporto explaining why did not choose to sacrifice men under by joining undisciplined rabble in intrenchment determined to keep head of bridge listened with breathless interest to narrative of attack capture of oporto how be that fifty gun battery did not knock bridge to piece when french tried to cross be more than can say colonel must fancy that be so terrified at utter rout on other side must see well enough for have view right over town to intrenchment that simply fired wildly believe single ball hit bridge though of course ought to have sunk dozen boat in couple of minute men must have held for day though be suffering somewhat from fire of two of french field battery found that step have be taken to remove boat from other side there be great number of along bank enemy must have crossed mile higher up at spot where took men over so fallen on rear therefore withdrew to save from being cut up captured uselessly now tell about troop of yours o'connor terence gave somewhat detailed account of manner in took command of subsequent operation being desirous of doing justice to herrara trooper to own two orderly there be much laughter among officer at assumption of command at subsequent step took to form mob of men into orderly body interest took place of amusement a told how have prevented french from crossing at mouth of minho caused soult to take circuitous difficult route by orense subsequent defence of defile night attack upon french surprised much when brought story to conclusion there be warm expression of approval among hearer must congratulate most heartily mr o'connor colonel said what seemed at first very wild hare brained enterprise if mind saying so certainly turned out singular success must have seemed almost impossible that young ensign must be able to exercise authority over great body of mere peasant who have everywhere shown utterly insubordinate useless under native officer be nothing short of astonishing be most gratifying to find that portuguese must under english officer develop fighting power far beyond anything with have be hitherto credited what be going to do now be intending to send despatch on to sir john cradock wait here for order think that have better take despatch on mr o ' connor suppose that be anything like so full a story have told be sure must be of a much interest to general a have be to will do so sir will start evening horse have three day rest at villa nova be quite fit to travel must be feeling terribly anxious about cousin officer who have first told about remarked there be saying what may have happened in oporto after be stormed must indeed be if be there terence replied be happy to say that be at present in coimbra having travelled with under charge of portuguese lady friend of herrara mean to say that persuaded bishop to let out of convent scarcely terence laughed though bishop did unwittingly aid congratulate on getting out colonel said travers be telling day after left what curious coincidence be that nun who threw out letter must turn out to be cousin of yours will tell how managed mind telling sir if here will promise not to repeat bishop of oporto be somewhat formidable person be to lodge complaint against might get into serious trouble be perfectly capable of having stabbed dark night in street of lisbon therefore think must be a well to omit detail of share played in matter without that story be simple enough having got boat with two men in at end of street in stood convent went there in dress of ecclesiastic just a french burst into town bishop have fled on night before to serra convent on other side of river be able to produce authority from satisfied lady superior be bearer of order for nun to make for bridge to cross river at once of course accompanied crowd be great naturally got separated in confusion orderly managed to get cousin out of crowd took straight to boat a soon a saw that have gone persuaded lady superior to take rest of nun back to convent at once a bridge be by time broken french have made appearance got nun together made off with a fast a must run after seeing that be nearly back to convent without sign of french being near joined others in boat rowed across river be simple business altogether though at first seemed very hopeless especially to get authority of bishop colonel said with smile certainly seemed most hopeless part of business terence replied happily be able to manage somehow well certainly have have most remarkable series of adventure mr o'connor now will go inspect corp of course will be rationed while be here will be under general order until hear from cradock quite so colonel be sure will be proud of being inspected by of course be unable to do complicated manoeuvre do know know pretty thoroughly can do in rough ready way that for actual work be think just a good a parade ground performance will go on ahead sir form up must rather if mind that must have warning colonel said will just go down quietly see how quickly can turn out very well sir there expressed wish to go a be provided with horse pony of kind in ten minute rode off in body officer have be very busy time terence have be away serving out uniform seeing that be properly put on work be just over men be sauntering about round tent when party arrived herrara came up saluted be known to colonel a have dined with terence at mess on way through after few word terence said to herrara have assembly blown let men fall in herrara walked back to tent moment later horn blew have uncouth sound bore resemblance to ordinary call be promptly obeyed men snatched musket from pile in front of tent in wonderfully short time whole be formed up in rank stiff immovable excellently done colonel said british regiment must have fallen in more smartly accompanied by terence followed by rest of officer rode along line evening before terence have impressed upon captain of company necessity for having rifle perfectly clean a be about to join british camp so that piece be in perfect order when inspection be over mounted group drew off little troop will form up in column of company terence said bull macwitty who be at head of respective regiment gave order movement be well executed men proud of uniform on mettle at being inspected by british officer did best best left little to be desired after marching past formed into company square to resist cavalry then retired by alternate company then formed into line excellently done said colonel indeed can hardly believe possible that party of peasant have in month time be formed into body of good soldier must like officer to come up call officer there be officer call now sounded twelve captain with two major rode to front saluted mr herrara colonel said have seen with surprise greatest satisfaction movement of men under do greatest credit will have pleasure in sending in most favourable report to general result of inspection of regiment hear from mr o'connor that men have shown capable of holding own against french can say must feel perfectly confident in going into action with regiment supported by such brave capable troop must instead of have portuguese troop equally to be trusted must very speedily turn french out of portugal drive from peninsula officer bowed rode off troop have not learned salute when horn sounded be at once dismissed drill well mr o'connor must congratulate most heartily on what have done if nothing else have added to army couple of strong regiment of capable soldier if have not seen must have thought impossible that over men must be converted into soldier in so short time that without experienced non commissioned officer to work up returning to coimbra with colonel terence rode to house where herrara friend have taken room told that be going to leave don jose at once wrote several letter of introduction to influential friend at lisbon telling that daughter have escaped from sack of oporto asking to show kindness to officer to whom chiefly owed safety terence meanwhile returned to camp arranged with herrara two major that everything be to go on a usual during absence urging to work hard at drill to impress upon men necessity now that be in uniform of carrying a soldier doing credit to corp five day later arrived at lisbon taking with report from commandant of inspection of corp have begun to be afraid that have be killed taken prisoner mr o'connor sir john cradock said a terence presented that must have fallen back with romana into spain seems to have behaved very badly for a hear although have men with half of regular troop retired without shot being fired except by two regiment who be mauled by french cavalry left silveira in lurch be on other business general fear that will think that exceeded order hope that will consider that result have justified doing so will kindly first run eye over report by officer commanding at coimbra sir john cradock read report with puzzled expression of face then said what regiment be that colonel wilberforce speaks of in such high term be part of romana force speaks of a corp under command a being strong be not romana men sir body of ordenancas of whom a report will inform came by combination of circumstance to take command appointing lieutenant herrara who commanded escort colonel two orderly a major portuguese trooper of escort a captain of company have be several time engaged with french can not speak too highly of behaviour of officer men sir john cradock burst into laugh certainly be cool hand mr o'connor assuredly did not contemplate when sent off that must return a colonel of two regiment did sir see gave general instruction to concert measure with romana for defence of frontier saw at once romana be hopeless be therefore driven to take measure a oporto have fallen can not say be successful at least may say that gave fourteen day extra time to prepare defence if did not take advantage of time be not fault look of amusement on general face turned to one of interest how did do sir corp prevented soult from crossing at mouth of minho general killing two hundred of men driving boat back across river when french general saw that must not cross in face of such opposition be obliged to march army round by orense down by pass ought to have be successfully defended by portuguese be good service indeed mr o'connor received despatch from agent at oporto saying that soult landing have be repulsed by armed peasant men be little more than armed peasant then sir though have have few day hard drill still british officer must scarcely have called soldier well think that wilberforce report show that have right to title now take seat mr o connor newspaper there be arrived two day ago while look over report terence have written in much greater detail than be usual in official report a wished general to see how well men officer have behaved be twenty minute before general finished very remarkable report mr o'connor very remarkable must dine with evening have many question to ask about also about storming of oporto of have a yet received detail although messenger from bishop brought news day ago seems to have made terrible mess of ought to be hung sir terence said indignantly after getting unfortunate peasant together sneaked off hid in convent on other side of river on very night before french attacked unfortunately mr o'connor can not give men desert must want rope on board ship in harbour for purpose bishop be firebrand of most dangerous kind suppose will have here in day two for said in letter that be on way there be one comfort will be too busy in quarrelling with authority to have time to spend on quarrel with then will see in hour time please ask captain nelson to come in here have note for to write terence bowed retired what nuisance captain nelson said be wanting to hear that have be doing be to dine with general terence said perhaps will meet there captain nelson found that be wanted to write note of invitation to such of officer who be still at lisbon a have dined there when terence be last general guest a general invitation overrode other engagement most of be present when terence returned mr o'connor have story for gentleman general said when cloth be removed wine put upon table be not sure whether be right in calling mr o connor for have be performing duty of colonel commanding two regiment in portuguese service will preface story by reading report of colonel wilberforce commanding at coimbra of state of efficiency of command there be look of surprise at general remark surprise be greatly heightened on reading of colonel wilberforce report now mr o'connor general said when have finished be sure that will be obliged by giving detailed statement of manner in raised regiment of operation that undertook with more detail give better for be well that must understand how portuguese can be best handled may say at once that personally be greatly indebted to for having proved that when even partially disciplined well led be capable of doing very good service fact of own have be hitherto very doubtful smile be exchanged among auditor when terence described manner in came to command body of undisciplined ordenancas when spoke of state in found romana army reason for determination to keep column intact listened more attentively exchanged look of surprise when described rapid march to mouth of minho repulse of soult attempt to cross from tuy then described how have joined silveira mutiny of general troop still more surprise be manifested when related action in defile bravery with troop have behaved manner in have be handled by trooper that have appointed a officer night attack on cavalry infantry of head of soult column be equally well received reason for not joining army at braga of keeping aloof from mob of peasant at oporto be a much approved a be holding of bridge for while reason for withdrawing well gentleman general said when terence have finished think will allow aide de camp mr o'connor have given good account of that if went outside order doing so have be most amply justified have indeed general one of senior officer said warmly can answer for must have be proud to have be able to tell story murmur of approval ran round table be difficult to say whether mr o'connor readiness to accept responsibility manner in in short space of month turned mob of peasant into regular soldier quickness with marched to spot threatened by soult so compelled to entirely change plan of campaign conduct in defence of defile in night attack be most remarkable must wish to say general that in telling story have be chiefly anxious to do justice to hearty co operation of lieutenant herrara service rendered by own two orderly trooper by must have done absolutely nothing work be hard incessant drill discipline of troop be wholly due to understand o'connor be quite right for to say so thoroughly recognize that must have done good service be to man plan organizes infuses own spirit into under command that everything be due now mr o'connor think will ask to leave for few minute case be rather exceptional one will be glad to chat matter over with officer present well gentleman what do think that be to do with mr o'connor went on with smile a door closed behind terence experience affords guide general of senior officer said be simply amazing that lad of seventeen suppose be not much over must have conceived carried out such plan sound like piece of old knight errantry clive did a much clive be year older when first became thorn in side of french what be opinion sir be already lieutenant general said sent home strong recommendation that must be promoted when be last here received intimation three day ago that have be gazetted lieutenant transferred to staff time will simply send home copy of report have furnished with that of colonel wilberforce say leave report to speak for that in opinion be case altogether exceptional be can do now question of course be whether will return to staff service again will continue in command of corp with have done so much if doe latter must have local rank otherwise must be liable to be overruled by portuguese officer of superior rank think that best way must be to send copy of report to lord beresford saying that opinion be very strong that lieutenant o'connor must be allowed to retain independent command of corp that have raised disciplined will either bestow local rank upon treat corp a forming part of british army like of trant that must give local rank a colonel in case must operate still independently in connection with beresford own force must almost think that first step must be best general if might say so in first place beresford will have number of irregular party operating with while corp must be invaluable to be capable of taking long march know mountain forest must keep supplied with news while harassed enemy a officer on staff o'connor must have much greater power among portuguese population than must have on own account in own army must be very much le likely to be interfered with by leader of other party corp perhaps must be best way colonel will send report to beresford say have appointed lieutenant o'connor to remain in command of corp will attach to own command saying that will be obliged if will have commission made out for giving local rank of colonel in portuguese army beresford be gallant soldier will appreciate a do work o'connor have done a know nothing of lad age will comply a matter of course with request will in writing home strongly recommend two cavalryman for commission a to herrara will ask beresford to give rank of lieutenant colonel will suggest to beresford that trooper must receive commission in army have earned be more than can say of other portuguese soldier so far a have heard terence be then called in again in first place have pleasant piece of news to give mr o connor namely have received from home official letter on recommendation have be gazetted to rank of lieutenant transferred to staff in second place have decided that while still retaining on staff will be continued in present command will obtain for commission a colonel in portuguese service corp will form part of command act with british army will request lord beresford to appoint mr herrara to rank of lieutenant colonel will recommend commission be given to trooper two orderly of whose service spoke so highly will recommend for commission in army will request lord beresford to give local rank a major terence coloured with pleasure confusion be greatly obliged to general said at feel that service have tried to perform be for to judge general said kindly officer here quite agree with that service have be very marked exceptional be at one with a to how must be recognized moreover in obtaining for rank of colonel in portuguese army be not only recognizing service be adding to power that will have of rendering further service to army although attached to force will receive colonel commission from lord beresford who be now general appointed by portuguese government to command army be now late party rose of shook hand warmly with terence who retired with friend captain nelson latter told before went in to dinner that have have bed put up for in own room well colonel o'connor nelson laughed must allow to be first to salute a superior officer be absurd altogether terence said almost ruefully still captain nelson though may hold superior rank in portuguese army go for very little have seen enough of portuguese officer to know that even own soldier have not got respect for in own army be only lieutenant be so lad however there be never promotion more deserved a hung rather left to be portuguese colonel be only right that must supply deficiency hope will not have to wear portuguese uniform terence said earnestly must think not o'connor will ask general in morning of course will not wear present uniform because be now gazetted into staff out of own regiment now will smoke quiet cigar before turn in have other story to tell that have not already related well yes have one be only of personal interest then gave account of discovery of cousin in convent at oporto how have managed to rescue ending by saying have told story nelson so that if by unexpected accident be found out that be escaped nun friend appeal to general for protection may be aware of circumstance help certainly will do so captain nelson said warmly certainly have wonderful head for devising plan began early terence laughed be always in mischief before got commission suppose help see have wonderful luck say anything against luck good luck be of use unless fellow know how to take advantage of be just what have done suppose that will stay here for day two horse want couple of day rest have uniform to get suppose can get one made in couple of day whether be portuguese english one yes dare say will be able to manage that next morning to great satisfaction terence learned that general said have better wear staff uniform accordingly went with captain nelson be measured portuguese seems to have improved amazingly in two month have be away latter said a came out from shop seem to jabber away quite fluently have be talking nothing else have acted a instructor so get on very fairly now at moment carriage drove past be bishop of oporto said terence suppose have just arrived be good thing that doe not know a well a know captain nelson said dryly if did adventure must be likely to be cut short by knife between shoulder dark night doe not know at terence laughed advantage be on side in present case be advantage captain nelson laughed when think that have raised hand against venerable somewhat truculent prelate shudder at boldness only caught glimpse of a passed must see that look rather scared perhaps have recovered yet from fright gave laughed terence have seen heard enough of doings paid very small instalment of debt due to uniform be promised for next evening terence felt when put on that be considerable improvement upon late one stained discoloured a be by wet mud travel after paying visit to general to say good bye terence mounted started for coimbra upon arrival there four day later at once reported to commandant received copy of general order of last tuesday latter said congratulate warmly on being confirmed in rank thought that must be so for one must not reckon have taken place corp must have maintained present state of efficiency be very good to say so colonel british officer appointed to command must do a well better than must think that must in way certainly must not be followed with same confidence by men a must follow with troop like everything depends upon confidence in commander corp be now attached to army colonel be good enough to order to be rationed before have now order from general for to draw pay ration same a british troop be right colonel said examining document will take copy of a be general order must keep original see that have now adopted uniform of staff be certainly great improvement upon of infantry officer appearance go for good deal among portuguese see by way that have got step in army yes colonel general be good enough to recommend of course be glad in one way be sorry that have put out of regiment have be brought up with of course be necessary for must not have gone over other men head in when man get special promotion be always into regiment for reason will be glad to hear that men have be behaving extremely well in absence have not heard of single case of drunkenness misconduct among have be down there several time always found hard at work drilling seem to to improve time see on leaving colonel quarter terence rode to cousin mary rose with exclamation of surprise a entered what handsome uniform terence how be that have changed be now regularly on general staff mary be uniform look very well in said

marched over alp burnt jerusalem divil bit do know see that if did know must do hap'orth of good think that particular piece of knowledge must o'grady terence agreed with hearty laugh still even if did learn portuguese must ask for mind dicky because be only year senior to if made commander in chief of portuguese army must never have cheek to give order three week later came startling news that sir arthur wellesley have arrived at lisbon be to assume command of army sir john cradock be to command at gibraltar there be general satisfaction at news for event of last campaign have given who served under implicit confidence in sir arthur be felt that sir john cradock have be very hardly treated in first place be good way senior to sir arthur in second place have battled against innumerable difficulty time be now approaching when must reap benefit of labour to terence news came almost a blow for felt that be probable might be at once appointed to british regiment personally must not have cared so much must have regretted greatly for sake of men who have followed be true that might obey herrara a willingly a did knew that native officer did not posse anything like same influence with portuguese that english did that there might be rapid deterioration in discipline morale remained in state of uncertainty for week at end of time received letter from captain nelson tearing open read a follows dear o connor dare say have be feeling somewhat doubtful a to position since heard that sir arthur have superseded sir john cradock may tell at once that have taken over whole of sir john staff yourself of course included ventured to suggest to sir john that must mention case to sir arthur told that have intended to take opportunity of first informal talk have with to do so opportunity came yesterday sir john went fully into case showed report mentioned how came to appoint because of clear lucid description gave of movement of division of moore army sir arthur remembered name at once circumstance under have mentioned in general order for conduct on board transport coming out sir john told that said 'there be doubt that o'connor be singularly promising young officer sir john check gave soult on minho might have completely reversed success of frenchman campaign have have spaniard portuguese to oppose report show that o'connor have done wonder with two regiment of will not think of removing from command trustworthy native corp of description must be of greatest advantage will act like trant wilson command a eye of army be much obliged to for having brought case before notice for otherwise not knowing circumstance might very well have considered that position of lieutenant on staff a commander of two native regiment be anomalous one must doubt have inquired how occurred before thought of superseding officer have selected explanation more than justifies appointment ' so see terence change will make difference in position a fancy sir arthur will not let grass grow under foot be likely to have lively time of before long by way gazette have arrived contains appointment of two men to commission while waiting at leirya terence have ordered uniform for officer have after consultation with herrara decided upon one approximating rather to cavalry than to infantry dress a being more convenient for mounted officer consisted of tight fitting green patrol jacket breech of same colour half high boot gold embroidered belt sling two english officer wore yellow band round cap herrara gold one be sure colonel o'connor bull said when terence told macwitty that have be gazetted to commission can not thank enough macwitty have done best have be nothing more than teaching drill to lot of recruit have two three hard fight too bull have very good reason for thinking most highly of for must never have got corp into efficient state without assistance indeed doubt whether must have ventured upon task at if have not be sure must be well seconded by be good of to say so colonel macwitty said at rate have be rare bit of luck for little did think when be ordered to accompany be going to lead to getting commission well will do best to deserve that be sure will macwitty now that campaign be going to commence in earnest may have two three year hard fighting may have opportunity of getting step before go home three day later order came to terence to march north again with corp to place in defensible position north of mondego to co operate if necessary with trant silveira also ordered to take post beyond river cuesta portuguese general have gathered fresh army of six thousand cavalry thirty thousand infantry greater portion be in position in front of victor outpost between tagus mondego be portuguese troop of line under lord beresford have be drilled organized to extent by british officer british german troop numbered fighting men sir arthur wellesley at lisbon have choice of falling upon victor soult former must be most advantageous operation upon other hand portuguese be most anxious to recover oporto second city with fertile country round fact influenced decision be that cuesta be alike incapable obstinate be wholly indisposed to co operate warmly with british british commander therefore decided in first place to attack soult force at leirya be ordered to march to coimbra five british battalion two regiment of cavalry with portuguese troop be ordered to abrantes santarem to check victor must endeavour to make rapid march upon lisbon four portuguese battalion be incorporated in british brigade at coimbra beresford retaining under personal command on d of may sir arthur reached coimbra reviewed force strong being portuguese german british soult be badly informed of storm be gathering about many of officer be disaffected be engaged in plot to have supplanted consequently kept back information received of movement of british illustration who be sir what troop be sir arthur chapter xxi portugal freed on th of may terence be directing movement of men who be practising skirmishing among rough ground at bottom of hill upon have taken up position to defend if necessary road crossed men have thrown up several line of breast work along face of hill to point where steep ravine protected flank of position presently saw party of horseman riding down hill behind reined up suddenly when half way down hill paused to watch what be being done then came on again a approached terence recognized erect figure of officer who rode at head of party cantered up saluted who be sir what troop be sir arthur asked sharply name be o'connor sir men constitute corp have honour to command form up in line general said briefly terence rode away at gallop a soon a reached spot where bugler be standing for bugle have now taken place of horn have before served purpose latter at once blew assembly then order to form line men dashed down at top of speed in very short time formed up in long line with officer in front break into column of company general who have now ridden with staff to front said manoeuvre be performed steadily well send out alternate company a skirmisher while other company form line move forward in support when have be done order came skirmisher form into company square to resist enemy cavalry have be so frequently practised that in few second six square be formed up in attitude to receive cavalry be very well done colonel o'connor sir arthur said with more warmth than be usual with men be well in hand know business be very creditable display indeed have proved capacity for command have not forgotten what have heard of sir will not be long before service be utilized so saying rode on captain nelson lingered behind for moment to shake hand with terence may feel proud of o'connor said sir arthur be not given to praise can assure good bye must catch up turning soon overtook general staff that general be well satisfied be proved by fact that three day later following appeared in general order officer commanding in chief on thursday inspected corp under command of lieutenant with rank of colonel in portuguese army o'connor be much pleased with discipline quickness with corp went through certain movement ordered by corp have already greatly distinguished sir arthur must point to a example to be imitated by officer having command of portuguese troop soult position have now become very dangerous spanish portuguese insurgent be upon lima principal portion of own force be south of douro franceschi cavalry supported by infantry artillery by mermet division occupied country between river vouga be without communication with centre at oporto except by bridge of boat although aware that there be considerable force gathering at coimbra french general have idea that whole of british army be assembling there confident that success must attend operation sir arthur directed portuguese corp to be in readiness to harass soult retreat through mountain denies up valley of tamega so to force to march north instead of making for salamanca where must unite with french army there mounted officer brought similar order to terence hour after receiving corp be on march instruction be brief simple will endeavour to harass soult a retreat across tras o monte try to head off to north act a circumstance may dictate service be dangerous one terence felt that be high honour that general must have appointed to undertake for assuredly must not have sent corp on mission have not considered that must be relied upon to take care of must be wholly unsupported save by party of peasant ordenancas must have to operate against army broken doubtless by defeat more determined to push on a delay might mean total loss followed line of vouga to point where emerged from hill crossed came down upon douro ten mile above san joao at nearly same spot where have before made passage when on way to join romana be now well beyond district held by french south of douro obtaining number of boat crossed river then made for mirandella on river tua halted distance from town having made march of over seventy mile in two day learning from peasant there be french troop west of tamega marched next day to crest looking down into valley here halted until must learn that soult be retreating what road be following have not long to wait for news for on night of th while be on march by vouga british force have moved forward to aveiro hill division have there taken boat proceeding up lake to ovar have landed at sunrise on th placed on franceschi right in meantime paget division have marched to albergaria while cotton division trant command moved to turn franceschi position on right darkness ignorance of road prevented movement being attended with hoped for success have operation be carried out without hitch franceschi mermet must have be driven off line of retreat to bridge of oporto must have be captured destroyed a be franceschi fell back fighting joined mermet division at crijo day march in rear although whole be driven on following day from position retired in good order that night effected retreat across bridge of boat be then destroyed a franceschi report informed soult that whole force of ally be now upon at once sent off heavy artillery baggage by road to amarante mermet be posted at valongo with order to patrol river to seize boat at oporto be also secured on morning of th british force be concentrated behind hill of villa nova sir arthur took place on top of serra convent from whence commanded view of city opposite bank saw that french force be stationed for most part below oporto franceschi report have led soult to believe hill division have come by sea expected that transport must go up to mouth of douro that british must attempt to effect landing there river took sharp turn round serra convent sir arthur saw that large convent on opposite bank known a seminary be concealed by hill from soult position that might be occupied without attracting attention of french after much search little boat be found in few men crossed brought back two large boat from opposite side of river in troop at once began to cross two company have taken possession of convent before soult be aware of what be going on then prodigious din arose troop be hurried through town bugle trumpet sounded alarm while populace thronged to roof of house wildly cheering waving handkerchief scarf church bell added to clamour three battery of artillery have be brought up close to serra convent now that there be longer need of concealment be brought forward a french issued from town hurried towards post held by two company have crossed opened heavy fire upon french pushed on gallantly in spite of fire musketry of soldier wall of convent be strong more boat have be obtained minute added to number of defender attack be nevertheless obstinately continued french artillery endeavoured to blow in gate for time position of defender be serious enemy troop be now evacuating lower part of town immediately did so inhabitant brought boat over brigade under sherwood crossed there in meantime general murray have be sent with german division to effect passage of river two mile farther up soult order to take possession of boat have be neglected be not long before murray crossed with force confusion in french line of retreat be now terrible battery of artillery who brought up rear be smitten by fire of sherwood men many be killed rest cut trace galloped on to join retreating army sherwood men pressed in rear infantry on roof of seminary poured fire on retiring mass gun on serra rock swept long line have murray now fallen upon disordered crowd discomfiture must have be complete held force inactive afraid that french might turn upon drive into river general stewart major harvey furious at inactivity charged french at head of two squadron of cavalry only dashed through enemy column unhorsed general laborde wounded general foy receiving however support whatever from murray gallant little band of cavalry be forced to fight way back with loss thus a franceschi have be saved from destruction from error a to road soult be saved loss of army by murray timidity in case sir arthur masterly plan failed in attaining complete success deserved terence have engaged several peasant to watch road leading from oporto a soon a learned that long train of baggage heavy gun be leaving city by road to amarante crossed valley took up position on catalena hill flanking road a waggon came along opened sudden heavy fire upon although protected by strong guard convoy fell into confusion many of horse being killed by first volley of driver leapt from seat deserted charge others flogged horse tried to push through struggling mass incessant fire be kept up just a terence be about to order whole corp to charge down complete work large body of cavalry followed by heavy body of infantry appeared on scene be merle division have hastened up from valonga on hearing firing advance of cavalry be checked by musketry fire merle at once ordered infantry to mount hill drive portuguese off latter stood ground gallantly for time inflicting heavy loss upon assailant terence saw however that must not hope to withstand long attack of whole french division leaving two company behind to check enemy advance marched along crest of hill until came upon road crossing from amarante to ave river by time have be joined by rear guard who have retired in time to make escape before french reached top of hill merle posted brigade along crest of ridge to prevent repetition of attack to cover soult line of retreat if be forced to fall back while terence took up position near pombeiro whence presently saw convoy enter amarante have satisfaction however of noticing that be greatly diminished in length great many of waggon having be left behind owing to number of horse have be killed attack have have advantage of be unaware for have so occupied merle attention that have neglected to have boat taken across river enabled murray command to cross next day error have murray be possessed of dash energy must have proved fatal to french army next day terence sound of gun on serra height distance be too great for crack of musketry to reach have idea that british be crossing river until saw french marching across mouth of valley towards amarante among such veteran troop discipline be speedly recovered encamped in good order in valley that town be however in hand of portuguese loison from treachery incapacity having disobeyed soult order retired before advance of portuguese force under lord beresford evacuating amarante taken road to guimaraens passing by pombeiro have sent no news to soult latter general be altogether ignorant that have left amarante upon receiving news from head of column at once saw that position have now become desperate one beresford learned at same time have marched up tamega valley to take post at chaves where silveira have joined retreat in direction therefore be impossible at once destroyed baggage spiked gun at nightfall guided by peasant ascended path up serra catalena marching night rejoined loison at guimaraens passing on way through pombeiro terence have left place few hour before believing that soult must return up valley of tamega ignorant that beresford silveira barred way marched after nightfall towards chaves took up position where must arrest for time retreat of french army have left two of men at pombeiro have halted short time after completing long arduous march when two men came up with news that soult have passed by very place have few hour before left a there be more than one route open to soult terence be unable to decide have best take men have already performed very long march be absolutely necessary to give rest therefore allowed to sleep during day towards evening crossed serra de cabrierra came down upon salamende sent out scout for news destroying gun ammunition baggage of loison division soult reached carvalho on evening of th drew up army on position that have occupied two month before at battle of braga reorganized force ordering loison to lead advance while took command of rear continued march next day sir arthur wellesley who have be obliged to halt at oporto until whole army with artillery train have passed river reached braga having marched by much shorter road terence scout brought news that whole of french army be marching towards salamende wholly unsupported a be ignorant of position of beresford silveira knowing nothing of sir arthur march towards braga decided not to attempt with force to bar way to soult twenty thousand men to hold salamende for time then fall back up mountain before doing so sent party to blow up bridge at ponte nova across cavado also sent second regiment to defend passage at riuvaens thinking likely that soult must again cross mountain to chaves sent herrara in command of force at bridge while remained at salamende here have house facing road by enemy must approach loopholed road barricaded late in afternoon french cavalry be seen approaching heavy fire be at once opened upon rapidity of discharge showed franceschi that place be held by more than mere party of peasant drew off cavalry allowed infantry to pas for hour portuguese held ground repulsed three determined assault then seeing strong body of troop ascending hillside to take position in flank terence ordered troop to fall back did in good order took up position high up on hill french made short pause small body of cavalry that soult have left near braga brought news that british army be entering that town scout be sent forward at once report that bridge of riuvaens be destroyed that portuguese regular troop be on opposite bank decided to take road by ponte nova night be terrible one rain have for two day be continuous troop be drenched to skin impatient at hardship that have suffered scout reported that bridge here have also be destroyed that one of parapet be still unbroken that force on other side consisted only of peasant soult ordered major doulong officer celebrated for courage to take hundred grenadier secure passage violent storm be now raging footstep being deadened by roar of wind french crept up killed portuguese sentry on side of bridge before must give alarm then crawled across narrow line of masonry then rushed up opposite height shouting firing peasantry believing that whole french army be upon fled at once bridge be hastily repaired at four o'clock in morning whole of french army have crossed retreat be opposed at bridge of single arch over torrent by party of portuguese peasantry after two repulse french led by major doulong carried be just in time for in afternoon british came upon strong rear guard left at salamende light troop at once turned flank while sherwood attacked in front fled in confusion to ponte nova a general imagined that soult must take other road retreat in direction be for time unperceived just a be crossing british artillery opened fire upon bridge with terrible effect very many of enemy being killed before must effect passage further retreat be performed without molestation british troop have made very long march in hope of cutting soult line of retreat a french unlike british carried provision for march there be now little hope of overtaking especially a main body be far ahead sir arthur halted for day at riuvaens where terence corp be now concentrated having marched there night be driven out of salamende a soon a british entered place general inquired what corp be holding at once sent for terence let hear what have be doing colonel o'connor terence have a soon a heard that army have arrived at salamende written out report of movement from time that have marched from vouga now presented general waved aside tell said terence related a briefly a possible course have followed reason of movement good general said when have finished calculation be well founded of course must not calculate on soult night march across catalena hill a knew nothing of whereabouts of beresford silveira have good reason to suppose that soult must continue march up valley of tamega to chaves be only mistake committed older soldier might well have fallen into same error when have found out mistake acted promptly must not have done better than to proceed to salamende did well to destroy bridge to place force to defend passage here for naturally supposed a supposed that soult must follow road down to chaves be again deceived be in way to blame position be most judiciously chosen on catalena hill on soult natural line of retreat heard that enemy baggage train have be very severely mauled be only saved from destruction by merle deploying whole division against force attacking again see made stout defence at salamende saw large number of french dead there a marched in if everyone else have done a well a have done young sir soult army must never have escaped terence bowed retired deeply gratified for have be doubtful what reception must be knew that have done best twice have be mistaken time mistake have allowed soult to pas unmolested be therefore more pleased on learning that so skilful general have declared that mistake although unfortunate be yet natural soult reached orense on th without gun store ammunition baggage men exhausted with fatigue misery most of shoeless without musket have left orense seventy six day before with men have lately be joined by from tuy returned with having lost by sword sickness assassination capture of be taken in hospital at oporto chaves vianna braga one be killed in advance remainder captured killed within last eight day day later news arrived that victor be at last advancing considerable number of troop assembled at salamende among terence corp be ordered to march to join force opposed to terence started two hour before bulk of force got into motion traversing ground at high rate of speed struck road from lisbon day in advance of british troop there be however occasion for action for victor who have taken abrantes have on receiving news of fall of oporto at once evacuated that town fallen back for time operation ceased on side british army have suffered slight loss in battle long march terribly wet weather effect of climate told heavily upon upwards of men be in short time in hospital fortunately however reinforcement of equal strength arrived from england fighting strength of army be therefore maintained there be still however great want of transport animal commissariat be for most part new to duty ignorant of language sir arthur wellesley be engaged in endeavour to get cuesta to co operate with obstinate old man refused to do so unless plan be adopted be of so wild impracticable character sir arthur preferred to act alone especially a cuesta army have already be repeatedly beaten by french utter worthlessness of soldier demonstrated pause of operation in spain entailed by concentration of command of soult ney victor lapisse on frontier have given breathing time to spain large army have again be raised same confident idea same jealousy between general same quarrel between junta have be prevalent once again spain be confident that must alone unaided drive french across frontier altogether forgetful of easy crushing defeat have before be inflicted upon like moore sir arthur wellesley be to extent deceived by boasting believed that must obtain material assistance in way of transport provision at least valuable diversion might be made by spanish army accepted too to extent estimate of spaniard a to strength of french believed that fighting force in peninsula did not exceed men whereas in reality amounted to over greatest impediment to advance be want of money for while british government continued to pour vast sum into cadiz seville for use of spaniard be unable to find money for advance of own army soldier consequently be unpaid badly fed almost in rag large proportion of shoeless to meet most urgent want general be forced to raise loan at exorbitant rate at lisbon yet while great general victorious army be nearly starving in portugal british government have landed troop in italy have despatched one of finest expedition ever sailed from england consisting of troop a many seaman marine of fleet to walcheren where small proportion of died of fever rest returned home broken in health unfit for active service without having performed single action worthy of merit mayo fusilier be among regiment stationed at abrantes terence received order to take up position four mile ahead of town hold unless victor again advanced in overwhelming strength then to fall back on abrantes exactly suited own wish be pleasant to to be within short ride of old regiment while at same time corp be not encamped with british division for own position be anomalous one among officer who did not know be regarded a young staff officer must not explain position held without constantly repeating manner in have gained commission a colonel in portuguese service during month have passed without movement continued effort to improve corp borrowed dozen non commissioned officer from colonel corcoran to instruct sergeant in duty thus enable to train others relieve officer of of work have in first report stated that have kept back l of money carried to romana for use of corp a have never received comment instruction a to portion have not be expended have still money in hand spent in supplementing scanty ration served out frequently rode into abrantes spent evening with mayo fusilier first time did so requested officer always to call a before terence o'connor be absurd being addressed a colonel when be only lieutenant in service of course when be with corp be different thing be colonel must be called so be really very annoying to be called so here must be feeling quite rusty colonel corcoran said to sitting here doing nothing after nine month of incessant moving about be not rusting colonel be hard at work sharpening blade be improving corp men drill sergeant four hour day for other eight of be repeating instruction that have received to three others so that by time be in movement again hope to have sergeant who know something of duty to fifty men can assure that in addition to great need for such men when troop be out skirmishing otherwise detached in small party felt that appearance on parade be greatly marred by fact that non commissioned officer did not know proper place proper work bull macwitty indeed company officer must instruct in being cavalryman yes noticed that when saw at colonel said of course be of consequence at a far a efficiency went to eye of english officer naturally something seemed wanting must be glad of at least four more officer to company at one time thought of writing to lord beresford to ask to supply with came to conclusion that have better leave matter a be in first place young officer must know nothing of work nothing of in second place if be men of good family must not like serving under officer who have be raised from rank lastly if became discontented might render men so have done very fairly at present have better go on a be when get sufficient number of trained men to furnish full supply of non commissioned officer will do better than with commissioned one for men be of course carefully selected know to be trustworthy whereas sent might be idle worse than useless spake like king solomon terence o'grady said not that can have known anything about military matter roar of laughter greeted very doubtful compliment thank o'grady terence said be one of prettiest speech have heard for long time will know where to come for character be right there terence may live good many year before get chance of calling whole british army under arm a did at salamanca terence be at once assailed with storm of question for with exception of o'grady one have suspected share that dicky ryan have have in affair terence knew that latter have kept secret for have asked only two three day before therefore assumed expression of innocence what on earth do mean o'grady what do mane why somehow other be at bottom of shindy when troop be turned out on false alarm really o'grady be too bad know that trick be played at athlone be suggestion a never must find out how alarm originated of course put down to whereas be just a likely to have be own work colonel corcoran know that dicky be in mess room at convent at time when alarm broke out be so colonel agreed for know that be talking to when hoolan ran in told that there be row in town on what do base suspicion o'grady just upon knowledge of two lad colonel faith there never be piece of mischief afloat that be not mixed up with if be have to say o'grady terence replied must advise not to go hunting for mare nest again know that can see a far into brick wall a most people can not see what be going on on other side same terence o'grady said doggedly to end of life will always believe that have hand in matter there be one else that know of except ryan who must have have cheek to do thing believe that can deny will not trouble to plead not guilty except before regularly constituted court terence laughed at rate a when march begin will go on first a scout may be that will send in news will turn out british army again will forgive if do for be likely that must have divarsion after turning out instead of marching out back again like regiment of omadhouns chapter xxii news from home week after arriving at abrantes seeing that there be probability whatever of fighting for time terence have suggested to herrara that must be good opportunity for to run down to lisbon for few day to see fiancee friend in town know who really ought to apply to for leave said a be sort of half independent corp seems simplest way for to take responsibility nobody be ever likely to ask question about now that will simply be matter of hard drill till army move again can be very well spared if be company work be captain business if two regiment be manoeuvring together will of course be under bull macwitty must be acting a brigadier must like to go very much herrara said have not yet have pleasure of introducing to family friend a lieutenant colonel of course wrote to people when received commission from lord beresford must be really fun to surprise of school fellow comrade so if think that will not be inconvenient must like very much to go then if be must start at once will give sort of formal letter of leave in case be questioned a go down can get to santarem to night to lisbon to morrow afternoon be there anything can do for yes wish must ask don jose if will through friend at oporto find out whether cousin mother be there at time french entered if be whether got through horrible business unhurt have be hearing about from friend who be couple of day there before force marched to braga tell that by account business be even worse than feared french came upon of comrade tied to post in great square horribly mutilated of with eye put out still living after spared one upon word can hardly blame in fact blame at so long a only vengeance on men people made worse for by keeping up desultory fire from window housetop when resistance have long ceased to be of use of course seeing comrade shot down in way infuriated troop still further suppose will make slightest difference in world to cousin whether mother be dead not for fancy from what mary said that mother never cared for in slightest possibly be jealous that child have first place in father affection however may be there be certainly no great love between of course subsequent treatment of cousin destroyed affection might have existed that by deed executed at time of marriage by portuguese law mary have right to estate at mother death be clear from effort made to get to renounce that right still there be more chance of ever inheriting than there must be of flying a nun must naturally have to renounce property doubt law of priest ridden country must decide that have done so tell be sure truly that refused to open lip to say single word when be forced to go through ceremony a doubt score of witness must be brought forward to swear that answered usual question renounced worldly possession that denial must go for nothing besides herrara said must never do for to set foot in portugal must be seized a escaped nun immediately must never be heard of again have doubt that must be so herrara a have nice fortune from father may be sure that will not trouble about estate here mother must be welcome to do a like with be after not unreasonable a be property descended to from father still must be glad to learn if doe not give great trouble whether if a be almost certain for people from country round took refuge there long before french arrived be in oporto if so whether got through sack of town unharmed doubt mary must be glad to hear be sure don jose must be able to find out for without difficulty herrara said indeed expect will soon be going back there now that there be british garrison in town that bishop must be utterly discredited there good many of junta must have be killed while rabble of town have be thoroughly discomfited place will be more comfortable to live in than have be for long time past be there anything else can do for nothing whatever quarter of hour later herrara left for lisbon bearing many message of kind regard on terence part to don jose family terence last word be by way herrara if must be able to find at store in irish whisky wish must get six dozen case for what must be more handy sixteen eighteen gallon keg must get sent on by cart coming here must be very much obliged have better be sent to care of colonel corcoran mayo fusilier abrantes must like to be able to give glass to friend when ride out to see have barrel case sewn up in canvas before address be put on must not trust to escort of british guard if be aware of nature of content must be safe with for can get that anywhere must be too much for honesty of irishman if be to see cask labelled irish whisky week later colonel corcoran said when terence rode in by bye o'connor there be cask of wine for at quarter be brought up by ammunition train morning officer said that portuguese colonel have begged so earnestly to bring up that must not refuse be herrara doubt colonel have gone down to lisbon for week ah suppose sent keg of choice wine will taste next time come out colonel have be wishing that have something better than ordinary wine of country to offer

captain o'grady others have asked several time to go in dine at mess that have not gone hope to day will meet at luncheon can understand that feel little uncomfortable at first meeting with lot of

direction there must be little village scattered among hill have so far escaped french english plunderer let party take four five dollar with want anything can be got idea be couple of young kid three four duck couple of goose a many chicken of course vegetable that can get hold of man sancho be capital cook will get fire ready two three assistant will be here by one o'clock so foraging party have better return by ten if there be anything to be brought will have colonel bull said macwitty will go will get dozen of captain to go too between be hard if manage to get enough by ten o'clock officer

vegetable dozen fire have already be lighted sancho have obtained a many assistant so that by time colonel fifteen officer rode up lunch be ready after chatting for few minute with terence led way to rough table be placed under shade of tree ammunition box be arranged along for seat although portion of what have be brought in have be cooked effect of table be imposing why o'connor colonel said have got one of genius like aladdin ordered to bring up banquet for have not seen winged thing since marched from coimbra here have got luxury of season wonder like independent action if be what come of there have be feeding on tough ration beef here be content of whole farmyard almost officer have be out before bull macwitty have be introduced to now sat down to meal be sorry major o'driscol be

to find that there be something ca do so with much laughter fun meal be eaten have not told yet where got provision o'connor colonel said be too bad to keep good thing to yourself have be work of eight officer colonel rode off morning in different direction among hill there be not one of who returned empty handed wine be fairly good colonel said a set down tin mug after long draught be scarce worth sending way up from lisbon have to follow colonel thought must appreciate better after have done eating have not have male since left athlone o'grady said when at last reluctantly laid down knife fork be jabers must be up with if french be to put in appearance now for faith think must run yard to save life tin mug be taken away washed when table be cleared be mighty particular o'connor colonel said one mug be good enough for if liquored up dozen time by way never do one of wine be pretty well like if there be slight difference must not matter when board be cleared large jug be placed before terence water bottle at various point of table thought colonel that might prefer spirit even to wine terence said be right o'connor good glass of wine after good dinner be bad thing after such meal a have eaten think that even bastely spirit of theirs after be not so bad when get accustomed to be better than wine settle matter bit terence poured of spirit from jug into tin filled up with water help said passing jug to o'grady who sat next to o'grady be about to do so when suddenly set jug down by power exclaimed in astonishment be real cratur go on o'grady go on others be waiting while be looking at if feel too surprised to take pas jug on o'grady grasped will defind wid life exclaimed in meantime colonel have filled mug gentleman said solemnly after raising to lip o'grady be right be irish whisky good at that be cruel trick have played on o'grady said with sigh a replaced empty mug upon table have almost forgotten taste have come to take kindly to stuff here now will have to go through again be like holding cup to lip of old heathen tartarus taking away again tantalus o'grady och what doe matter when have be dead buried thousand of year how spilt name where did get from terence asked herrara to try find for at lisbon thought be most likely that english merchant there must have laid in stock seems that have found one do hear that colonel there be whisky to be have at lisbon not know well captain o'grady can say be that will at dinner evening move vote of censure upon a mess president for not having discovered fact before talk of dinner colonel there be not one of must think of sitting down to ration beef after male a have have with whisky here too move colonel that further mintion be made of dinner have doubt that terence will give divilled bone there be a much left on table a have eaten before start home to night will do with pleasure in fact be exactly what reckoned upon terence replied think o'grady must send to lisbon for of be only think colonel faith must go down for if have to walk with pay in boot to carry back on shoulder can find herrara there asked yes can give address where will be found anyhow colonel o'flaherty said must be sure present will join in matter protest against captain o'grady going down to lisbon to fetch whisky for mess must know sir a well a do that must never return again must probably hear day that body have be found by side of road with three four empty keg beside there be general burst of agreement perhaps doctor o'flaherty o'grady said in tone of withering sarcasm be who must like to be messenger there might be worse one o'flaherty said calmly a believe that captain hall be going down on week leave to morrow propose that being englishman therefore more trustworthy than irish member of mess must be on such mission be requested to purchase for use of mess to escort back again how much will say colonel be grave matter not to be answered hastily doctor let see there be thirty two officer with regiment now what must say must be fair allowance per day for man must say bottle colonel there be of wo take a much o'grady will square matter up protest against insinuation o'grady said rising moreover must observe that be mighty little must be left for after man have taken whack be sixteen bottle day for continuance must consider that too much seeing that have be out of dacent liquor for month may have fortnight after arrives to make up for lost time will say sixteen bottle make three gallon o'grady said persuasively will be having lot of men drop in when get known that have got supply there be something in o'grady well will say three gallon be forty two gallon for fortnight will commission captain hall to bring back quantity if say forty five colonel will give drop in flask to start with be a likely to be fifteen day a fourteen anyway let be forty five then colonel assented will undertake captain hall willingly colonel will get whisky emptied into wine cask a know one of chief commissary at lisbon can get brought up with wine for troop after sitting for couple of hour colonel proposed that must go for walk while who preferred must take nap in shade move o'connor said that meeting be adjourned until sunset think will be very good plan colonel proposal be carried out o'grady few others declared that must prefer nap rest started on foot sauntered about in shade of wood for couple of hour then gathered at table again at eight o'clock grilled joint of fowl duck be put upon table at nine mounted rode back to abrantes how many of quart jug have be

bishop that place have be defended to last when infuriated french broke in within wall have be killed terence be not altogether sorry to hear news woman have be party to cruel imprisonment of mary doubt cousin must feel death grief must not be very deep be thought just a well for that connection with portugal must be altogether severed mother might have endeavoured to tempt to return there although felt sure that must not succeed in might at least have caused trouble be better that there must be end of a to woman have be in agreement with bishop have be mixed up in intrigue death be caused by misplaced confidence in of course have not known that have left town thought that under protection must be safe in palace must have be bad lot said to evidently did not make husband happy
