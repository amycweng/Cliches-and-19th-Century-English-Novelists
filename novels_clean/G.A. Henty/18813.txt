until return to india indian blood in margaret vein boiled fiercely wrote aunt letter caused that lady to congratulate on good fortune have prevented from having to receive under roof girl of so objectionable violent character although language john holland used concerning letter be strong indeed be well satisfied a have foreseen that be not probable margaret friend must have allowed to marry without communicating with father that rajah might have project of own for disposal laid case before captain who placed in charge of wife until marriage took place except for long absence of husband margaret life have be very happy one be looking forward to time when after voyage must be able to give up profession settle down upon saving when month passed by news came of hooghley having reached

mysore be just madness time returned from voyage ben called upon mr holland have given up vestige of hope when be known that name of husband be not among list of whom tippoo have be forced to release margaret holland however still clung to hope face be paler there be set pathetic expression in so when spoke of husband a being still alive ben must sooner have cut out tongue than allow slightest

quarrelsome often said to have heard father say that man who can use fist well be sure to be cool quick in emergency know what be before quality be of far more importance in case than book learning therefore dick say never quarrel on own account whenever see boy bullying smaller one take opportunity of giving lesson while learning one in day of old know first duty of true knight be to succour oppressed want to be true knight will get thrashed sometimes doubt mind that perhaps next time will turn table dick acted upon advice by time be fifteen have established reputation among not only boy of own school of district in addition to strength quickness have fund of dogged endurance imperturbable good temper did not fail even on rare occasion when in combat with boy much older than be forced to admit defeated fact that fought not because be angry a if be matter of business gave great advantage readiness to take up cause of boy ill treated by be so notorious will tell dick holland became threat saved many boy from being burned ten day before conversation with mother have said dick can stand no longer have tried to be patient for six year can be patient no longer feel that year of suspense must kill therefore have made up mind to sail at once voyage will take five month perhaps may have to remain little time at brother before can start now that time be come think that perhaps be about to do wrong that may cost life can not help dick dream of father almost night wake up thinking that hear calling upon to help feel must go mad if be to last much longer be ready mother boy said earnestly have be hoping for time that must say must start soon though have not of course strength of man think will be more than made up by advantage must have a boy in looking for father at

news of father lad a to getting out of prison if do come to hear of why honest must not give quid of 'baccy for chance say a think that be altogether desperate job a far a be concerned talking lingo a do be just possible a might be able to travel about in disguise without anyone finding out especially a rajah uncle ought to be able to help bit put in way of thing perhaps send trusty chap along with there be doubt be strong for age being thin nothing muscle must pas better a native than if have be thick chunky old woman tell a have regular name a fighter that have given lesson to many bully in

taken up country will be quite sufficient say nothing about having be born in india that father be native rajah of official still more wife be very prejudiced consider to be quite different being to native of country found so on voyage to england at rate want affair talked about will be quite sufficient for people to know that be a said going out to make inquiry about truth of rumour right mother at rate captain have told that will look after make thing comfortable for so need not care about anything else certainly need not care dick be much more agreeable to get on nicely with everyone be very pleased when captain barstow called yesterday said that having heard at office that mr holland on passenger list be widow of old shipmate john holland have come round to see if there be anything

strong conviction be still alive be going out to endeavour to ascertain from native source whether be still living 'well ma'be hope that will succeed ' said be new to thought be drowned when hooghley went ashore anyhow mr holland honour for making journey just on off chance of hearing something of husband may be sure will do can to make voyage pleasant one for ' so see will start favourably dick for captain can do great deal towards adding to comfort of passenger when be known by purser steward that lady be under special care of captain ensures larger share of civility special attention than might otherwise obtain a soon a went on board indeed captain came up to good morning mr holland said have done quite right to come on board early give chance of being attended to before steward be

enough to journey about a protector have not thought a ought to have done what profession must follow however be only fifteen yet there will be time enough when get back if be to go into service sooner better ma'be one can hardly begin too young however say there be not plenty of good sailor afloat who did not enter until couple of year older than be there be strict rule a to age only fifteen be must have taken for at least year older however if like mr holland will put in way of learning good deal during voyage might a well be doing that a loafing about deck day much better captain be very much obliged to be sure that will be too must like immensely captain dick exclaimed at moment purser came up mr stevenson captain said be mr holland be wife of old friend john holland be

on voyage thank very much captain will indeed be comfort to have cabin to myself dick found that be berthed with two young cadet whose name learned from card fastened over bunk be latham fellow hour after arrival of holland on board passenger began to pour in rapidly deck of madras be soon crowded with friend luggage below be bustle confusion men shouted angrily to steward woman laden with parcel blocked gangway appealed helplessly to one for information aid sailor carried down trunk portmanteau mr holland when emerged from cabin having stowed away belonging made thing tidy congratulated on having be first on board so have not only avoided confusion obtained separate cabin might not otherwise have be able to do a captain must have be too busy to devote special attention to after having handed over to care of purser captain barstow have spoken to second officer who happened to be passing mr rawlinson said be son of old friend captain holland be going out with mother wish must keep eye upon let join midshipman in study with in morning possibly may enter service will be great advantage to to have got up navigation bit before doe so at rate will occupy mind keep out of mischief lad of age must be like fish out of water among passenger on quarterdeck ay ay sir will do what can for hurried away dick saw for present there be nothing to be done to look on be not until next morning when madras be making way south outside goodwins that second officer spoke to ah there be lad have be too busy to think of will be day two before settle down to regular work however will introduce to one two of midshipman will make free of ship dick be indeed already beginning to feel at home long table full from end to end have presented contrast to quiet dinner with mother that a sat down beside looked round thought must never get to speak to anyone throughout voyage however have scarcely settled when gentleman in naval uniform next to made remark well youngster what do think of suppose be new to be sir seems very strange at first suppose will get accustomed to oh yes will find pleasant enough by bye be ship doctor purser have be telling about mother made one voyage with father be first kinder captain never sailed with heard from purser that there seems to be chance of being still alive that mother be going out to try find out something about hope most sincerely that may succeed in doing so have be missing long time now still be reason why must not find there have be instance where men have be kept for year by of rascally native why goodness only know except suppose because fear hate think that time other english prisoner may be useful to mother look far from strong went on a glanced across dick to mr holland who be talking to lady on other side of have be ill sir have never known ill yet have be worrying great deal have waited so long because did not like to go out until must take with have friend in england with whom must leave look good deal

quite set up again performs almost miracle on homeward bound passenger come on board looking pale listless washed out at end of month at sea be different creature altogether purser have taken pain to seat mr holland at table next to person who must be pleasant companion for lady be now talking to be wife of chaplain in army have year before returned from india in madras knew to be kind pleasant woman dick did not care for cabin mate be young fellow of about eighteen year of age one be nephew of director of company other son of high indian official paid little attention to generally ignoring altogether conversing about thing people in india in tone of men to whom such matter be quite familiar in three four day dick became on good term with six midshipman madras carried two of be younger than two somewhat older while others be nearly out of time hoped that must be last trip in midshipman berth four younger lad studied two hour morning under second officer instruction dick took place at table regularly with mathematics have be only subject in have at distinguished at school found able to give satisfaction to mr rawlinson in study of navigation after work be over have hour practical instruction by boatswain mate in knotting splicing rope in other similar matter in fortnight have learned name us of what have at first seemed to innumerable rope long before have accompanied one of midshipman aloft on first occasion that did so two of topmen followed with intention of carrying out usual custom of lashing to ratline until paid footing seeing coming up midshipman laughed told dick what be in store for boy have be a awkward a most beginner in climbing shroud looseness give of ratline puzzling have for year practised climbing rope in gymnasium at shadwell be confident in power to do anything in way consequence be that a soon a sailor gained top where midshipman be standing dick seized one of halliard with merry laugh came down hand over hand minute later stood on deck well done youngster said boatswain mate who happened to be standing by a dick foot touched deck may be first time have be on board ship be easy to see that be first by long way that have be on rope must go up again yes must think so dick said have never climbed so high a because have never have chance ought to be easy enough man laughed there be not many sailor who can do said well let see how high will get a dick be accustomed to go up rope thirty foot high hand over hand without using leg be confident that with assistance must get up to main top lofty a be at once threw off jacket started found task harder than have anticipated did without pause be glad however when two sailor above grasped by arm placed beside on main top well sir one said admiringly thought be johnny newcome by way went up ratline came up that rope like monkey well sir be free up here if be must not make much odds to for must take ship company to capture want to get off paying footing dick said pulling five shilling from pocket handing to sailor for mother have told that be custom on first going aloft to make present to have given money for purpose can climb know anything about rope will be very much obliged if will teach can chapter brush with privateer dick be surprised when on descending to deck found that what seemed to by mean very difficult feat have attracted general attention not only did dozen of sailor pat on back with exclamation expressive of surprise admiration other midshipman spoke quite a warmly eldest saying must have got up rope holland must not have gone up straight a did without stopping for bit to take breath look so very strong think that be knack more than strength dick replied have done lot of practice at climbing for have always wanted to get strong heard that there be better exercise when presently dick went aft to quarterdeck captain barstow said to have astonished lad must hardly believe eye when saw going up that rope first caught sight of when have climbed twenty foot wondered how far must get at pace must have wagered hundred guinea to one must not have kept up to top well lad profession take to be certain that will be good sailor spoilt have now be three week out have made slow progress for wind have be light mostly from southwest be very dull work doctor said to dick one day at dinner here be three week out still hardly beyond channel there be one consolation be not fault of ship have be doing well under circumstance fate have be against thus far have doubt there be score of ship still lying in down be there when passed tedious a have be beating down channel with scarce wind enough most of time to keep sail full must have be worse lying there time still have gained good bit on sir if wind be to change round say to northeast brought along with must soon make up for lost time for must not take three day to run here however will begin to do better soon heard captain say that must change course tomorrow be somewhere off cork when make few mile more westing will bear away south if have have favourable wind must have taken departure from start with in quarter be obliged to make more westing before lay head on course must risk getting in too close to french coast privateer be a thick a pea there must not be afraid of french privateer doctor well not altogether afraid of one very often go in couple sometimes three of will work together think one privateer alone must venture to attack though might harass bit keep up distant fire in hope that might hear bear down to aid be always a well to keep free of if one can see unlucky shot might knock one of stick out of must mean delay trouble if worse have sharp brush with two of on last voyage beat off be stronger then than be now for have two hundred troop on board must have astonished if have come close enough to try boarding in fact be slackening fire to tempt to do so when made out that large craft coming up astern be english frigate sheered off know what end of be rather fancy be taken frigate followed gaining fast later on must hear gun in distance did not join in chase then doctor oh business be not fighting if be attacked of course defend go foot out of way if can help three week at sea have done wonder for mr holland now that be fairly embarked upon quest expression of anxiety gradually died out sea air braced up nerve what be of still greater benefit to be able to sleep soundly dreamlessly thing have not done for year dick be delighted at change in look quite different woman mother said think friend at shadwell must know if be to see now feel different woman dick have not felt so well so bright since father sailed on last voyage be more convinced than ever that will succeed have be trying very hard for year to be hopeful now feel so without trying of course be partly lovely weather sea air sleeping so well partly because everyone be so kind pleasant a soon a madras have be headed for south began to make better way wind freshened somewhat continued in same quarter grumbling ceased over bad luck be having hopeful anticipation that after must make quick passage be freely indulged in on fourth day after changing course be off coast of spain be hundred fifty mile distant at noon day wind dropped suddenly hour later be dead calm be going to have change dick doctor said a stopped by lad who be leaning against bulwark watching flock of seabird be following shoal of fish dashing down among with loud cry too intent upon work to notice ship lying motionless hundred yard away what sort of change doctor most likely strong blow though from what quarter be too soon to say however have reason to grumble after nearly month of light wind must expect turn of bad weather hope will come from north will take down to latitude of madeira beyond may calculate upon spell of fine weather until cross line a afternoon wore on weather became more dull there be cloud in sky deep blue be dimmed by sort of haze presently after talk between captain first officer latter gave order hand take in sail order have be expected men at once swarmed up rigging in quarter of hour upper sail be furled light spar be then sent down to deck may a well get top gallant sail off too mr green captain said to first officer be a well to be prepared for worst be sure to blow pretty hard when change come top gallant sail be got in when course have be brailed up secured hand be called down presently captain after going to cabin rejoined mr green glass have gone up again dick heard say look a if be coming from north sir yes with east in must not come from better quarter turned gazed steadily in direction yes there be dark water over there so there be sir be right mind how hard blow so that doe come on gradually agree with hurricane burst when one be becalmed be always dangerous even when one be under bare pole gradually dark line on horizon crept up towards ship a reached sail bellied out began to move through water wind increased in strength rapidly in hour be running south at ten eleven knot hour thermometer have fallen many degree a sun set passenger be glad to go below for shelter before going to bed dick went up on deck for few minute topsail have be reefed down madras be rushing through water at high rate of speed sea be getting up wave be crested with foam above star be shining brilliantly well lad be change be not captain said a came along in pea jacket seem to be going splendidly captain yes be walking along grandly making up for lost time be blowing hard sir will blow good deal harder before morning lad think will be anything very severe thing wo be so comfortable downstairs for next day two be likely to be worst of motion of ship kept dick awake for time wedging tightly in berth presently fell off to sleep did not wake again until morning two cabin mate be suffering terribly from seasickness felt perfectly well although took long time to dress so great be motion of ship on making way on deck found that overhead sky be blue bright sun shining brilliantly wind be blowing much harder than on previous evening heavy sea be running a sun sparkled on white crest of wave scene be far le awe inspiring than have be when looked out before retiring to berth ship under closely reefed main fore top sail be tearing through water at high rate of speed throwing cloud of spray from bow occasionally taking wave over sent deluge of water along deck what do think of lad mr rawlinson who be in charge of watch asked a after watching opportunity made rush to side caught firm hold of shroud be splendid sir said have be going like night officer nodded how long do think will last sir two three day will be worse sir not likely to be be taking along rarely be doing good in more way than one look there a rose on wave pointed across water behind dick lad turned saw brig running parallel to course mile distant what of sir be french privateer unless be greatly mistaken have british ensign flying sir ay go for nothing may possibly be trader on way down to guinea coast by cut of sail look of hull have doubt that be frenchman be passing sir oh yes in gale heavy sea weight tell will soon leave astern in fine weather expect must sail round round if french must fight ship a well a can build must not be in with why fire at mr rawlinson officer laughed how be going to work gun with ship rolling like lad be like two muzzled dog at present can hing watch other be sorry to say that think fellow be alone two three time have fancied that caught glimpse of sail on starboard quarter must not swear to think be mistaken called captain attention that way just before went down ten minute ago thought saw too however a there be nothing to be done went down for caulk have not left deck since noon yesterday if be bigger than other suppose will leave behind too mr rawlinson ay lad will leave behind presently if be what think be likely to hear more of later on must not be so far offshore a unless be on lookout for indiaman of course keep much farther out than ship bound up mediterranean having once spotted will follow like hound on deer trail however think be likely to find that have caught tartar when come up to ah here be doctor well doctor what be report below only usual number of casualty sprained wrist few contusion three four case of hysteric be mother all right doctor dick asked a have heard nothing of have doubt be be quite sure that will not trouble with hysteric woman who have have real trouble to bear dick can be trusted to keep nerve steady in gale suppose call gale doctor certainly be stiff north easterly gale if be facing instead of running before must not want to ask question be suspicious looking craft rawlinson broke off catching sight of brig now on port quarter yes be privateer have doubt unless be mistaken have consort somewhere out there to starboard however need not trouble about travelling a be be going two knot hour faster than brig so much better doctor said shortly can laugh at one of fellow when come to two of own care for company so longer gale hold on better mate nodded well dick doctor went on do feel a if will be able to eat breakfast will be ready enough for doctor see how will be possible to eat with vessel rolling like certainly will not be able to sit down to nothing must stay on table minute there will be regular breakfast today must get steward to cut chunk of cold meat put between two slice of bread make sandwich of a to tea ask to give bottle to pour tea into then if wedge into corner will find that be able to manage breakfast comfortably can amuse watching people trying to balance cup of tea in hand not more than dozen passenger ventured on deck for next two day at end of time force of wind gradually abated on following morning madras have sail set to light still favourable breeze madeira have be passed to dick disappointment except for fresh supply of vegetable there be occasion to put in there captain grudged loss of day while so favourable wind be taking along do think will see anything of brig again doctor dick asked a for first time since wind sprang up passenger sat down to comfortable breakfast there be saying dick if gained two knot hour during blow suppose gained more than one half must be hundred twenty mile so astern of after be only day run think be pretty sure to follow for bit for will know in light wind travel faster than do if get becalmed while still hold breeze will come up hand over hand be likely enough that in three day so may get sight of behind be evidently captain opinion also for during day gun be overhauled carriage examined musket brought up on deck cleaned on following day men be practised at gun then have pike cutlas exercise none of passenger particularly noticed proceeding for dick have be warned by captain to say nothing about brig a be only passenger on deck at time whisper of privateer have come to ear of others party be just going down to lunch on third day when lookout in maintop hailed deck sail astern how doe bear be dead astern of sir can only make out upper sail must say that be royal mr green ran up with telescope slung over shoulder can not make much out of sir shouted to captain may be anything must be nearly thirty mile astern think with pearson that be royal see take look round mr green mate did so presently called down can make out something else away on starboard quarter so far astern that can scarce swear to still can be nothing sail thank mr green daresay that will know more about later on when captain joined passenger at table one of lady said seem interested in ship astern of captain yes mr seaforth one be always interested in ship when one get down a far a may be indiaman although madras have claim to great speed in light breeze like one never like being passed explanation be considered a sufficient nothing more be said on subject by sunset upper sail of stranger must be made

certain that have leg of in morning when dick came up found that wind have quite died away sail hung loosely from yard looking astern saw two vessel be six mile away perhaps two mile apart a lay without steerage way have swung partly round saw that be brig schooner former have doubt from lofty mast general appearance be same madras have passed six day before a passenger came up be full of curiosity a to vessel of course know more actually than do yourselves captain said a of gathered round questioned may a well tell frankly that have very little doubt about being two french privateer

decreased distance meal be silent one when be over captain said a soon a fellow open fire lady must ask to go down into hold sailor have already cleared space below waterline large enough for will take down cushion so on to make a comfortable a possible under circumstance pray be alarmed at noise may hear will be below waterline perfectly safe from shot may be sure that will do best to keep scoundrel from boarding will let know from time to time how matter be going unmarried men at once went up on deck others lingered for short time behind talking to wife daughter then followed wind have strengthened bit mr green captain said fancy will get more think so too captain then may a well get off upper sail make snug get off everything above top gallant then if wind increase will not want to

hour three vessel kept on way have heavier metal than that captain said cheerfully have doubt must reach be not game to play at long bowl for be probable that of carry long pivot gun if be to draw off bit must annoy amazingly while must not reach presently privateer opened fire again be now about mile away same distance from other shot fell close to indiaman two three passed through sail still reply be made men at gun fidgeted kept casting glance towards poop in expectation of order came at last be not what have expected double shot gun men captain said scarcely be order obeyed when brig be now on port quarter luffed up little into wind fired broadside of eight gun there be crashing of wood madras be hulled in three place two more hole appeared in sail while other shot passed harmlessly just astern of there be angry growl among sailor a schooner bore away little also fired broadside except that man be struck down by splinter from bulwark damage be done bear up little captain said to second officer who be standing by helmsman want to edge in little towards brig not enough for to notice now gentleman went on to passenger have doubt that most of be good shot want after have fired broadside to direct attention to brig helmsman if can render impossible for men to stand at wheel will make mincemeat of fellow in time directly have fired port broadside be going to bring up into wind on opposite tack give starboard broadside at close quarter fire until have gone about then pick off helmsman if can get ready men brig be now little more than quarter of mile distant aim at foot of mainmast went on let man fire a get mast on sight moment later first gun fired whole broadside followed in quick succession down with helm hard down sheet tack men whose duty be to trim sail ran to sheet brace madras swept up into wind a sail drew on other tack came along on course must take within hundred yard of brig a approached three rifle cracked out on poop one of men at helm of brig fell a did so dozen more shot be fired a companion dropped beside brig deprived of helm flew up into wind three men ran aft to wheel deadly rifle spoke out again two of fell third dived under bulwark for shelter steady men captain shouted fetch mainmast out of a swept along under stern of brig gun of other broadside poured in fire in succession raking crowded deck from end to end moment later mainmast be seen to sway tremendous cheer broke from madras a went over side dragging with foretopmast with gear down with helm again captain shouted bring head to wind keep there first officer sprang forward to see that order be carried into effect minute later indiaman lay with sail aback at distance of hundred yard on quarter of brig grape canister captain shouted broadside after broadside swept deck of brig hampered by wreckage be lying almost motionless in water so terrible be fire that privateer men threw down ax with be striving to cut away floating spar ran below double shot gun give one broadside between wind water captain ordered haul on sheet brace mr green get on course again schooner wo trouble now that craft have indeed at first luffed up to come to assistance of consort on seeing fall of latter mast that be incapable of rendering assistance have again altered course feeling incapacity to engage so redoubtable opponent single handed three hearty cheer broke from on board madras a after pouring in broadside at distance of fifty yard left brig behind proceeded on way then care about taking prize captain one of passenger said a crowded round to congratulate upon easy almost bloodless victory taking prize be not business be to weaken crew by sending of off in prize might find short handed if met of gentleman fell in with bad weather besides must not be worth sending home brig be signalling to consort sir mr green said coming up ay ay expect want help badly enough saw chip fly close to waterline a gave that last broadside be lowering boat one of passenger said so be expect have got more than one can swim think be settling down captain said a looked earnestly at wreck astern see how be crowding into boat how of others be cutting slashing to get wreckage clear of be certainly good bit lower in water than be first officer agreed schooner have come round wo be long before be alongside of there be doubt that brig be settling down fast men stood on bulwark waved cap frantically to schooner others must be seen by aid of glass casting spar hen coop other article overboard jumping into water after soon sea around wreck be dotted with head floating fragment while wreckage of mainmast be clustered with men when madras be mile away schooner be lying thrown up head to wind fifty yard from brig boat be already engaged in picking up swimmer suddenly brig gave heavy lurch there go captain exclaimed moment later hull have disappeared schooner remained alone by time whole of lady have ascended from place of safety to poop general exclamation broke from passenger a brig disappeared schooner will pick up captain said must have suffered heavily from fire think will have gone down with boat have already reached schooner must have taken good many mainmast foretopmast spar must support rest to say nothing of thing have thrown overboard there be one wasp le afloat further adventure be met with throughout voyage have spell of bad weather off cape captain said be nothing to gale often encountered there that voyage a whole be exceptionally good one for even after delay have encountered at start passage have lasted four month half touched at point de galle for news to ascertain whether french warship have be seen of late along coast supply of fresh vegetable fruit be taken on board a vessel after touching at madras be to go on to calcutta few of passenger landed at point de galle dick mother went ashore will have plenty of opportunity of seeing indian later on dick mr holland have said a gig will not take ashore may a well stop quietly here heard captain say that must weigh anchor again in four hour dick be rather disappointed a must be at madras before long did not much mind ten day later anchored off that town little be to be seen except fort number of warehouse native town while scenery contrasted strongly with of ceylon with mass of green foliage with hill rising behind for last fortnight mr holland have be somewhat depressed now that voyage be nearly over difficulty of task before seemed greater than have done when viewed from distance asked whether after must not have be wiser to have waited two three year until dick have attained greater strength manhood boy however when confided doubt to laughed at idea why know mother said agreed that have much greater chance a boy of going about unsuspected than must have a man besides must never have let remain longer without trying to get out mother know have gone through over over again talked about chance have have first rate voyage everything be going on just a must have wished must never do to begin to have doubt now have felt confident all along seems to that of thing must keep on being confident at rate until there be something to give cause to doubt on following morning landed in surf boat be fortunate in getting ashore without being drenched there be rush of wild looking half naked native to seize baggage upon mr holland with quiet decision accosting men in own language picking out four of to carry baggage up to one of vehicle standing on road ran along top of high beach rest fell back matter be arranged without difficulty after drive of twenty minute stopped at hotel be not like hotel mother dick remarked a drew up be more like gentleman house standing in own park almost european house be built so here dick be much more pleasant than when be packed together much nicer dick agreed if house have lot of ground like place must cover tremendous extent of country doe dick a one keep horse carriage doe not matter much blacktown a call native town stand quite apart from european quarter a soon a be settled in room seemed to dick singularly bare unfurnished mother son went out for drive in one of carriage belonging to hotel dick have learned so much about india from that although extremely interested be scarcely surprised at various scene met eye at bright varied costume of native many change have taken place during seventeen year have elapsed since mr holland have left india town have increased greatly in size sign of effect of siege by french thirty year before have be long since obliterated large handsome government building have be erected evidence of wealth prosperity be everywhere present chapter rajah now mother let talk over plan dick said a after dinner seated in two chair in veranda at little distance from other guest at hotel how be going to begin in first place dick will tomorrow send out messenger to tripataly to tell brother of arrival here how far be mother be about hundred twenty mile in straight line think good bit farther than by way will go how will travel mother will make inquiry tomorrow think that pleasantest way will be to drive from here to conjeveram think be about forty mile there can take native boat go up river palar past arcot vellore to vaniambaddy from there be only about fifteen mile to tripataly will tell brother way propose going of course if think other way will be better will go by be going to travel a be mother in native dress be point have be thinking over dick will wait ask brother think will be best when out there always dressed a native never put on english clothes except at madras used to come down here two three time year with mother generally stayed for fortnight three week during time always dressed in english fashion a by so doing must live at hotel take meal at public table without exciting comment mother knew several family here liked getting back to english way occasionally of course will dress in indian fashion while stay at brother so be only question of how will journey there think must prefer going a be will excite special observation travelling a english a will only be supposed that be on way to pay visit to of officer at arcot at conjeveram be large place there be sure to be hotel of sort other for be on main road from madras south on way up by water will of course sleep on board will go direct from boat to tripataly however need not decide until get answer to letter for will take very short time to get necessary dress for think most likely that brother will send down one of officer to meet possibly may come down heard what be talking about at dinner dick yes mother be something about tippoo attacking rajah of travancore did not pay much attention to be looking at servant in curious dress be very important dick will probably change plan travancore be in alliance with one think that tippoo attack on will end in being engaged in war with be talking to officer who sat next to told that if there have be capable man at head of government here war must have be declared a soon a sultan moved against travancore now that general meadow have be appointed governor commander in chief there be doubt said that army must move against tippoo in very short time that be already being collected that force be marching down here from bengal so see boy if war really break out english may march to seringapatam compel tippoo to give up captive have in hand must be splendid mother at rate dick a long a there be hope of father being rescued in way plan must be put aside well mother will be better in respect for of course if father be not rescued by army can try afterwards a arranged must be advantage in one way a must then be quite accustomed to country more fit to make way about week later old officer arrived from tripataly ah rajbullub mr holland exclaimed a came up with deep salaam be indeed glad to see again knew be alive for brother mentioned when wrote last year rajbullub be evidently greatly pleased at recognition think must have known lady said eighteen year make more change in young than in old truly be glad to see again there be great joy among who knew a child when rajah told that be here have sent on to say that will arrive tomorrow be to see to apartment to have in readiness intends to stay here day before returning to tripataly will come to hotel lady will take house always have when be here be kept for use of prince when come down to madras bade say that hope will remain here for none of room must be got ready at short notice have not written for hate writing be thing that have small occasion for be to tell that heart rejoiced at thought of seeing again that love for be a warm a be when be boy girl together be son rajbullub have often heard speak of yes indeed dick said warmly heard how saved from being bitten by cobra when be little girl ah young lord speaks tongue rajbullub said with great pleasure wondered whether must have taught to if have not be that always wrote to lord in language must have thought that must surely have forgotten after dwelling so long among white sahib always speak when together rajbullub thought that might day come out here that must find very useful too have be looking forward to returning for time to home where be born there be many question to ask about brother wife two son be younger than dick for mr holland be three year senior to rajah at last said will not detain longer rajbullub know that will have great deal to do to get ready for brother coming at what time will arrive hope to be here by ten in morning before heat of day set in will of course be there to meet so hoped lady said that must have come straight here first thought must be more pleasant for to meet in privacy assuredly must agreed will bring carriage for here at nine o'clock take young lord to rajah house at appointed time handsome carriage pair drove up to door of hotel in ten minute mr holland dick alighted in courtyard of large house four native servant be at door old officer led way to spacious room be carpeted with handsome rug soft cushion be piled on divan running round room divan being covered with velvet silk rug looking glass be ranged upon wall handsome chandelier hung from roof drapery of gauze lightly embroidered with gold hung across window why rajbullub have done wonder be if house be unfurnished yesterday be simple hindoo said lord brother like other rajah who use house when come down here have room upstairs in be kept locked up everything required for furnishing room us four of servant came down here with have to call in sweeper to clear house from dust wash down marble floor then everything be put into place cook who also came down have hired assistant will be ready for lord when arrives in hour one of servant ran in announced that rajah be in courtyard there be great trampling of hoof minute later ascended stair be met by sister dick at door of room mr holland have attired handsomely not so much for sake of brother that a sister with must expect to see in english lady of position dick thought that have never seen looking so well a when in dress of rich brocade with flush of pleasure expectation on cheek advanced to door be still little over thirty three year old although long year of anxiety sorrow have left trace on face rest quiet of sea voyage have done much to restore fulness of cheek to soften outline of figure rajah young handsome looking man of thirty ascended stair with eagerness speed be somewhat at variance with dick preconceived idea of stateliness of eastern prince sister margaret exclaimed in english embraced with warmth showed that affection for be unimpaired by year have passed since last saw then stood with hand on shoulder looking earnestly at know again said be changed can recall face well be welcome margaret most welcome be nephew went on turning to dick holding out hand to be taller than expected well nigh a tall a be be like mother mother be bold active strong writes boy be longing to see will be most welcome at tripataly have almost forgotten english margaret indeed spoke with difficulty evidently choosing word must quite have forgotten have not often have occasion to speak with english officer see by letter that have not forgotten tongue not in least mortiz have for year spoken nothing else with dick speaks a well a do be good rajah replied in own tongue in tone of relief be wondering how must get on with now let sit down have so much to tell other moreover be ravenous for breakfast a have ridden forty mile since sunrise breakfast be speedily served rajah eating in english fashion cling to of mother way see margaret a have grown older have become more english than be naturally a boy of thirteen a be when last saw listened to talk of around be guided by opinion good deal among there be feeling of regret that father have married english woman of course be ever trying hardest to show that in riding chase in exercise of kind be a worthy to be son of indian rajah a if have white blood in vein a grew up became wiser saw how great english be how steadily extended dominion how vastly better off be people under sway than be in day when rajah made war against neighbour land never have rest then grew proud of english blood although be to people rajah of tripataly native prince lord of destiny keeping up same state a father ruling in native fashion in inner house have adopted many english way wife have rival in zenana encourage to go about a mother did to look after affair of house to sit at table with to be companion not mere plaything be sure margaret stay with will do much good will learn great deal from have heard news since last wrote mortiz slight cloud passed across rajah animated face none margaret have little news from beyond mountain tippoo hate who be friend of english a much a hate english so there be little communication between mysore possession of nabob of arcot will talk later on of plan wrote of in last letter to think that be hopeless mortiz mr holland asked anxiously must not say that be hopeless said gently although seems to that after year chance be slight indeed that husband can be alive peril danger of enterprise so far a understood intend son to undertake must be terrible indeed see that mortiz dick have talked over thousand time so long a there be shadow of chance of finding father be ready to undertake search be boy in year have be trained for undertaking will when trial come bear a well a man well margaret will have plenty of opportunity for forming own judgment because of course will stay with long time before start on quest will be better to say more of now now tell about london be so much greater city than madras mr holland sighed saw by manner that be wholly opposed to plan although be quite prepared for opposition must not help feeling disappointed however perceived that a said must be better to drop subject for time accordingly put aside answered question madras be large be spread over wide extent if be packed with house a closely a must stand must not approach london in number of population how be that english send more troop out here margaret because can raise troop here english soldier can not stand heat a well a born to moreover must remember that at present england be at war not only with france half europe also with america be also obliged to keep army in ireland be greatly disaffected with on hand can not send large army so far across sea especially when force here be sufficient for can be required of be true said be wonderful what have done out here with such small force will have harder work before conquer india a believe will do than have yet encountered in spite of tippoo vauntings will have mysore before many year be over sultan seems to have forgotten lesson taught six seven year back next time will be last tippoo tiger a be will meet fate seems bent on provoking beyond mysore lie mahratta country mahratti alone can put thirty thousand horseman into field be not like people of bengal who have ever fallen with scarce attempt at resistance under yoke of one tyrant after mahratti be nation of warrior be plunderer if will be brave fearless soldier might have be united have have india under foot before coming of english chance have slipped from when say 'we ' see margaret meet will be desperate struggle indeed will thrash uncle dick broke in will see that will beat thoroughly rajah smiled at dick impetuosity so think english soldier can not be beaten eh well uncle somehow never do get beaten know how be suppose that be just obstinacy look how thrashed french here be just a well drilled a soldier there be twice a many of rajah nodded one secret of success dick be that english get on better with native here than french do know why except what have heard from people who went through war say that french always seemed to look down on native treated even powerful ally with sort of haughtiness irritated made ready to change side at first opportunity while british treated pleasantly so that there be real friendship between dick finding that conversation now turned to time when mother uncle be girl boy together left went downstairs found twenty horse ranged in courtyard while rider be sitting in shade several of being engaged in cooking be escort who have ridden with rajah from tripataly for indian prince must think of making journey unless accompanied by numerous retinue scarcely have entered yard than rajbullub came up with officer in command of escort fine looking specimen of hindoo soldier salaamed a rajbullub presented to dick lad addressed at once in own tongue be soon talking freely together officer be surprised at finding that lord nephew from beyond sea be able to speak language like native first dick asked nature of country place at must halt on way then inquired what force rajah must put into field be somewhat disappointed to hear that kept up hundred horseman including who served a escort see sahib there be occasion for soldier now that white be master do fighting for when rajah father be young man must put two thousand men under arm joined at siege of trichinopoly with twelve hundred now there be longer need for army there be one to fight of young men grumble old one rejoice at change formerly have to go to plough with spear sword beside because never knew when marauder from hill might sweep down besides when there be war might be called away for week while crop be wasting upon ground a to younger men who grumble say to 'if be tired of peaceful life go enlist in company regiment ' year of do so in other way change be good now that rajah have no longer to keep up army be not obliged to squeeze cultivator therefore pay light rent for land rajah be far better off than father be so that on side there be content prosperity even now fear of mysore have not quite died out position margaret rajah said after dick have left room be very precarious one when hyder ali marched down here eight year ago swept whole country from foot of hill to sea coast father must have be glad to stand neutral be of course bound to go with english a nabob of arcot nominal sovereign went with sympathy be of course with people most of chief be at heart in favour of hyder be not that loved preferred rule of mysore to of madras at time madras be governed by imbecile council be composed entirely of timid irresolute men be clear to that before force capable of withstanding must be put in field whole country beyond reach of gun of fort at madras must be at mercy of hyder what that mercy be have be shown elsewhere whole population have be either massacred carried off a slave therefore when storm be clearly about to burst almost of sent secret message to hyder to assure that sympathy be with that must gladly hail a ruler of carnatic father be in way inclined to take step marriage with english woman white blood in vein long known partiality for english must have marked for certain destruction a soon a received news that hyder troop be in movement rode with to madras at time force be comparatively large took three hundred men down with have allowed who preferred to remain behind four hundred stayed to look after family most of population took to hill a hyder force be too much occupied to spend time in scouring ghauts in search of fugitive when there be so much loot so many captive ready to hand on plain fugitive for most part remained there in safety palace be burnt town sacked partly destroyed fifteen hundred of people who have remained in home killed carried off father did service with horse fought by side be with colonel baillie force when be destroyed after for two day resisting whole of hyder army being mounted escaped reached madras in safety after losing number can tell about other day when peace be made hyder retired returned home rebuilt palace restored town if tippoo follows father example sweep down from hill there will be nothing for to fly again tippoo commanded one of division of hyder army last time showed much skill energy have since came to throne be scourge to neighbour in north so far a can see madras will be found a unprepared a be last time although chief of vellore arcot conjeveram other place may be better disposed towards english than be before for carnatic have terrible lesson last time will not dare to lift finger against until see large british force assembled so see sister position will be very precarious one at tripataly be likely that at time may be obliged to seek refuge here trouble may come soon may not come for year sooner later regard a certain that tippoo will strive to obtain what father failed to gain mastership of carnatic indeed make secret of intention to become lord of whole of southern india nizam neighbour in north fear power must offer feeble resistance be tippoo once master of south west coast mahratti can always be bought over especially if there be prospect of plunder relies too upon aid from france for although french since capture of pondicherry have lost chance of obtaining india must gladly aid in enterprise must bring about fall of english predominance here there be too considerable body of french troop in pay of nizam must at rate force master to remain neutral in struggle between english tippoo however will be quite unnecessary that must resume garb that dick must dress in same fashion did intend to remain at tripataly must not wish to draw attention of neighbour to fact have english relation resident with of course one know that be english be old story now must however be reminded of tippoo must hear of must use a pretext for attacking plundering a have decided to come down here there be reason why must not dress in european fashion must remain here brother mr holland said rather than bring danger upon dick must learn way of country here a well a with must start on search without going to tripataly not at margaret whether be with not will have to leave tripataly when tippoo advance presence will not in way affect plan wife son must travel with one woman boy more le will make difference at present scheme of yours seems to to border on madness need not discus that now will at rate be very glad to have with english side of have be altogether in background since went away though keep up many of custom mother introduced have almost forgotten tongue though force to speak sometimes with boy a be sure that in long run english will become sole master of southern india will be great advantage to to speak language however have many other thing to see about companionship of dick will benefit greatly know what always be out here son of rajah be spoilt early by one giving way to being allowed to do just a like naturally get into habit of indolence self indulgence never have occasion to exert to obtain strength activity make mother countryman irresistible in battle have be taught to shoot to ride know little else be sure will do immense deal of good to have dick with for time if nothing come of search for husband hope will take up residence permanently at tripataly have nothing to go back to england for dick with knowledge of language must be able to find good employment in company service thank greatly brother if a say quest must come to nothing must gladly settle down in old home dick inclination at present turn to sea have doubt that what say be true that there may be far more advantageous opening for out here however be matter for to talk over in future rajah stayed four day at madras morning carriage came at nine o'clock to fetch mr holland who spent several hour with brother be then driven back to hotel while dick wandered about with rajbullub through native town asking question innumerable observing closely different costume turban learning to know at once district trade caste from colour fashion of turban other little sign shop be endless source of amusement to somewhat surprised companion by desire to learn name of little article trinket even of various kind of grain dick in fact be continuing preparation for work knew that ignorance of trifling detail must a matter of course be known to native must excite more surprise suspicion than must be caused by serious blunder in other matter wrote down in notebook scrap of information obtained so a to learn by heart at leisure rajbullub be much surprised at lad interest in little matter a seemed to be not worth thought on part of lord nephew will never have to buy thing sahib said why must trouble about be going to be over here time rajbullub be just a well to learn a much a one can if be to stroll into market in tripataly have fancy to buy trifle country people must laugh in face be ignorant of name companion shook head must not expect white sahib to know such thing said if want to buy anything white sahib point to asks 'how much ' then whether be brass iota silver trinket file bunch of fruit native say price four time a much a must ask anyone else then sahib offer half after protesting many time that sum be impossible dealer accepts party be well satisfied if have seen anything that want to buy sahib tell will go get for then will not be cheated start for tripataly be made at daybreak dick mother drove in open carriage have be hired for journey rajah rode beside cantered on ahead escort followed vehicle luggage have be sent off two day before by cart country a far a arcot be flat everything be interesting to dick when arrived at city where be to stop for night at house rajah have occupied on way down sallied out a soon a meal be over to inspect fort wall have during outward voyage eagerly studied history of clive military exploit campaign by portion of india have be wrested from french be eager to visit fort whose memorable defence by clive have first turned scale in favour of british have previously be regarded by native a far le warlike people than french who be expected to drive in very short time out of country rajbullub be able to point out to spot associated with stirring event of time 't be forty six year back be boy of twelve six year later be here for rajah be on side of english although tripataly be be now under nabob of arcot lord have many cause of complaint against when declared for french lord who be not then rajah

day spoke of want nerve in good order for requires old horseman to have hand steady enough for shooting straight after hard ride ride be not severe for horseman be trying for leave shooting alone lad there be hurry for by time rajah have become convinced that be useless to try dissuade sister dick from attempting enterprise for have come over possibly earnest conviction of former that husband be still alive influenced to extent strength activity of dick showed that be able to play part of man said little watched boy closely made go through trial of strength with of trooper saw practise with blunted sword with others dick did well in trial rajah then requested anwar who be celebrated for skill with tulwar to give daily hour sword play after riding lesson undertook to teach to use rifle

rajah said one day to sister exercise have given so much nerve so steady hand that already shoot very fairly must expect to grow up into fine man margaret be not have gravest fear a to mad enterprise can not help telling for good be in opinion absolutely hopeless know mortiz said that think be folly on part to cling to hope while disguise from that there must seem small chance that husband have survived that can give reason for faith in still being alive confidence that will be restored to day have so firm conviction that nothing will shake why must have confidence if be not well founded in dream always see alive believe firmly dream of so often because be thinking of when be at sea several time felt disturbed anxious though without reason for doing so time on return found when compared date that ship be battling with tempest at time be so troubled about remember that first time happened laughed at when upon two other occasion turned out so said 'there be thing understand margaret know that in scotland there be many who believe in second sight a be called that there be family there say in ireland also where sort of warning be given of death of member of family sailor be superstitious people believe in thing landsman laugh at doe not seem to impossible that when two people love other dearly a do one may feel when other be in danger may be conscious of death may be said that such thing seldom happen be proof that never do so for people may be more sensitive to such feeling impression than others may be one of 'there be one thing margaret fact that have somehow felt when be in trouble must cheer when be away for if mere danger must so affect surely will know must death befall a long a feel that may be sure that will return safe sound to ' now believe that firmly be once troubled so troubled that for two three day be ill so convinced be that something have happened to jack yet that be not dead that when nigh two year afterwards ben came home learned that be on day of wreck of ship have so suffered be not in least surprised since then have more than once have same feeling have always be sure at time jack be in special danger have never once felt that be dead never once thought so be a certain that be still alive a if saw sitting in chair opposite to for firmly believe that did die must see spirit at rate must know for certain that have gone so whatever say though reason may be altogether on side will not shake confidence one bit know jack be alive believe firmly although of be not absolutely sure that will someday be restored to did not tell before margaret rajah said what say go for much with here in india there be many who a be said posse power that call second sight certainly of fakir do have heard many tale of warning have given have always come true will not try in future to damp confidence will hope with that husband may yet be restored to one evening dick remarked said down at madras uncle that must someday tell about invasion by hyder ali will tell about now rajah nodded son took seat at foot dick curled up on divan by side must know rajah began that war be really result of intrigue of sir thomas rumbold governor of madras council in first place have seriously angered nizam latter have taken french force into service english have compelled basult jung to dismiss madras sent officer to court with instruction to remonstrate with for so doing at same time gave notice that must no longer pay to tribute have agreed upon for territory called northern circars must have led to war bengal government promptly interfered cancelled altogether demand made by madras government for time patched up quarrel nizam professed to be satisfied saw that trouble might arise when english be more prepared to enforce demand therefore entered into negotiation with hyder ali mahratti for alliance whose object be entire expulsion of british from india mahratti from poonah be to operate against bombay in central india north be to make incursion into nizam be to invade northern circars hyder be to direct force against madras hyder at once began to collect military store obtained large quantity from french at town still retain on malabar coast madras government prepared to attack mahe when hyder informed that settlement of dutch french english on malabar coast being situated within territory be equally entitled to protection that if mahe be attacked must retaliate by incursion into province of arcot in spite of threat mahe be captured hyder for time remained quiet madras government gave fresh cause for offence by sending force in august to assistance of basult jung at adoni to get there detachment have to pursue route led for two hundred mile through most difficult pass through territory of nizam hyder council altogether ignored expressed determination of prince to oppose march did not even observe civility of informing that be going to send troop through territory say dick that made real difference in end alliance between three native power being made be certain that war must break out shortly still have not be for folly in giving hyder nizam reasonable excuse for entering upon hostility might have be deferred until madras government be better prepared to meet storm bengal government fortunately again stepped in undid at least part of evil took entire management of affair out of hand of rumbold council action be confirmed by board of director who censured proceeding dismissed sir thomas rumbold two chief associate from council suspended other member prompt conciliatory measure taken by bengal government appeased resentment felt by nizam induced to withdraw from confederacy hyder however be bent upon war imbecile government here took step to meet storm commissariat be entirely neglected have transport train most important post be left without garrison be towards end of june that received news that hyder have left capital at head of army of ninety thousand men of whom twenty eight thousand be cavalry attempted disguise a to object moved confident in power to conquer carnatic drive english into sea father have already made preparation everything be in readiness a soon a news reached started for madras under guard of escort with mother most of trader of town landowner who have gathered here in fear trembling be painful scene a may imagine will never forget terrified crowd in street wailing of woman many family who then left reached madras in safety of who remained in town be dead prisoner beyond hill hyder descended through pas of changama on th of july horseman spread out like cloud over country burning devastating slaughtering hyder moved with main army slowly occupying town after town placing garrison in must not suppose that devastated whole country be too wise for that anticipated reigning over a sovereign have wish to injure prosperity be only over tract where considered that devastation must hamper movement of english army that everything be laid waste on st of august invested arcot week later hearing that british army have moved out from madras broke up siege advanced to meet sir hector munro british general be doubt brave committed terrible blunder instead of marching to combine force with of colonel baillie who be coming down from guntoor marched in opposite direction to conjeveram sending word to colonel baillie to follow baillie force amounted to over two thousand eight hundred men munro to five thousand two hundred have united force must have exceeded eight thousand must have given battle to hyder immense army with fair hope of success english have won before now with greater odds against father have marched out with cavalry one hundred fifty strong with munro of course be with be to that english general gave despatch to carry to colonel baillie rode hard for at moment hyder cavalry might swoop down bar road got through safely next morning th baillie started encampment be within twenty five mile of madras with one long forced march must have effected junction with heat be tremendous baillie halted that night on bank of river cortelour bed be dry father urged to cross before halting colonel replied that men be too exhausted to move farther that a must next day be able to join munro mattered not on side of river encamped that night river rose for ten day be unable to cross on th of september got over by time tippoo with five thousand picked infantry six thousand horse six heavy gun large body of irregular detached by hyder to watch barred way colonel baillie finding that there be possibility of reaching conjeveram without fighting took up position at village on th be attacked by tippoo action lasted three hour although enemy be four time more numerous than be english beat off attack be not engaged for against tippoo large cavalry force few horseman must hing be therefore forced to remain in rear of british line though colonel baillie have beaten off attack made on felt that be not strong enough to fight way to conjeveram be fourteen mile distant therefore wrote to sir hector munro to come to assistance for three day sir hector did nothing on evening of th sent off force composed of flank company of regiment with managed to make way past force of hyder tippoo reached without having to fire shot arrival brought force up to over three thousand seven hundred men have munro made feigned attack upon hyder so prevented from moving to reinforce tippoo must have got through without much difficulty did nothing hyder seeing utter incapacity of man opposed to moved off with whole army gun to join son force set out a soon a be dark on evening of th moment started be harassed by enemy irregular march be continued for five six mile position becoming more more serious at last colonel baillie took fatal resolution of halting till morning instead of taking advantage of darkness to press forward at daybreak fifty gun opened on ten field piece returned fire until ammunition be exhausted order be issued by colonel who have completely lost head so that men be mowed down by hundred until at last enemy poured down slaughtered relentlessly did not see end of conflict when colonel gave order to halt father said to 'this foolish officer will sacrifice life doe think that three thousand men can withstand one hundred thousand with great number of gun will go while can can do good here ' mounted horse rode off in darkness came suddenly upon body of tippoo horseman dashed straight at cut way through with loss of force did not draw rein until reached roar of battle have be heard at conjeveram fury indignation in camp at desertion of colonel baillie detachment be so great that general at last gave order to march to assistance when force arrived within two mile of scene of conflict cessation of fire showed that be too late baillie force be well nigh annihilated munro retired to conjeveram at three o'clock next morning retreated with loss of heavy gun store to madras campaign only lasted twenty one day be marked by almost incredible stupidity incapacity on part of two english commander remained at madras father determined that must take more share in fighting until english general possessing courage ability have always before distinguished took command in meantime hyder surrounded captured arcot after six week delay then laid siege to amboor chingleput wandiwash in november sir eyre coote arrived from england took command confidence be at once restored for be fine old soldier have be engaged in struggle in india from time of clive with whole country in hand of hyder be impossible to obtain draft animal cart be not until middle of january that be able to move on th reached chingleput on th sent off thousand men to obtain possession of fort of carangooly be strong place work have be added to by hyder who have placed there garrison of seven hundred men detachment must not have be sent against have not news be obtained on way that garrison have fallen back to chingleput troop of cavalry went with detachment a father knew country well to surprise of captain davis who be in command found garrison on wall do think rajah captain davis who be riding by side asked bey order be be to take possession of place be supposed that must find empty ' must say that have better try with without order father replied annihilation of baillie force miserable retreat of munro have made terribly bad impression through country success be sorely needed to raise spirit of friend 'we will do ' captain davis said called up few english engineer company of white troop have with ordered to blow in gate father volunteered to follow close behind with dismounted cavalry when word be given forward went be hot work can tell enemy gun swept road musketry kept up incessant roar many fell kept on until close to gate then white troop opened fire upon hyder men on wall so a to cover sapper who be fixing powder bag soon ran back to there be great explosion gate fell with loud shout rushed forward into fort close behind came sepoys led by captain davis took sharp fighting before overcame resistance of garrison who fought desperately knowing well enough that after massacre of baillie force little quarter must be given british loss be considerable twenty of father little company be among killed great store of provision be found here proved most useful to army news of capture of carangooly so alarmed besieger of wandiwash that at once raised siege retreated on following day sir eyre coote force arrived there be curious thing on same day of same month sir eyre coote have twenty one year before raised siege of wandiwash by victory over army be covering operation wandiwash have be nobly defended by young lieutenant named flint who have made way in through enemy line few hour before treacherous native officer in command have arranged with hyder to surrender taking command have repulsed attack have even made sortie there be now long pause having commissariat train sir eyre coote be forced to make for seashore though hotly followed by hyder reached cuddalore french fleet off coast however prevented provision being sent to even after french have retired madras government be so dilatory in forwarding supply that army be reduced to verge of starvation be not until middle of june that movement be possible owing to want of carriage country inland have be swept bare by hyder on leaving cuddalore sir eyre coote be obliged to follow seacoast when arrived at porto novo army be delighted to find british fleet there scarcely le pleased to hear that lord macartney have arrived a governor of madras hyder army have taken up strong position between camp cuddalore sir eyre coote determined to give battle four day rice be landed from fleet with scanty supply in knapsack troop marched out to attack hyder formed part of baggage guard have therefore excellent opportunity of seeing fight march be by sea infantry moved in order of battle in two line after going for distance must see enemy position plainly be very strong one on right be high ground on be numerous battery must take in flank a advanced line extended from height to sand hill by shore have thrown up several battery might for aught knew have many gun hidden on high ground on flank hour be spent in reconnoitring enemy position during kept up incessant cannonade to english field gun attempted reply to officer of troop seemed impossible that force must advance to attack of hyder position without being literally swept away by crossfire must be opened upon when expressed fear father said will see repetition of terrible affair with baillie column english have now got commander who know business when be case there be never fear a to what result will be grant that lookout seems desperate hyder have advantage of very strong position very powerful artillery have six seven to one in point of number for firmly believe that before night will see in possession of hill hyder army in full flight presently saw movement two line of infantry formed into column instead of advancing towards hyder position turned down towards sea marched along between sand hill be at same time set in motion kept along between infantry sea so a to be under protection if hyder cavalry must sweep down preparation have be made under supposition that must advance by main road to cuddalore movement entirely disconcerted plan sand hill completely protected advancing column when have reached point almost in line with hyder centre artillery dashed up to crest of hill first column passed through break in moved forward against enemy gun above clearing way for short halt be made until artillery of second line came up also took position on hill then first column with gun moved forward again hyder have in meantime moved back line battery into position at right angle to that have before occupied facing passage through sand hill by english be advancing a soon a column issued from valley tremendous fire be poured upon again formed into line of battle covered by fire of artillery moved forward be grand sight father have left baggage remained by sea have ridden up on to sand hill from have view of whole of battleground be astonishing to see line of english infantry advancing under tremendous fire against rising ground occupied by dense mass of enemy presently there be movement opposite vast body of cavalry moved down slope a came red english line suddenly broke up a if by magic number of small square surrounded by glistening bayonet appeared where have stood down rode hyder cavalry gun on side be turned upon though must see confusion in rank caused by shot swept kept on seemed that little red patch must be altogether overwhelmed by advancing wave a came closer flash of fire spurted out from face of square must see horse recoil when close to bayonet then stream poured through interval between square a did so crackling volley broke out while from battery on sand hill incessant fire be kept up upon then following volley came incessant rattle of musketry confusion among cavalry grew greater greater regiment be mixed up together very number impeded action many gallant fellow detaching from mass rode bravely at square died on bayonet others huddled together confused helpless against storm of bullet shot at last a if with sudden impulse rode off in direction sweeping round regained position in rear of infantry while loud cheer broke from side square again fell into line advancing steadily drove hyder infantry before a be going on strong force of infantry cavalry with gun be moved round by hyder to fall on british rear however be met by second line have hitherto remained in reserve after fierce fighting be driven back along sand hill a be retiring main body of hyder cavalry moved round to support attack fortunately british schooner have sailed from porto novo when troop started have anchored near shore to give what protection must to baggage now opened fire with gun upon cavalry a rode along between sand hill sea with such effect that halted wavered when two of battery on sand hill also opened fire upon fell back in haste be hyder last effort british line continued to advance until have gained position occupied by enemy be soon in headlong flight hyder who have be almost forced by attendant to leave ground being with be wonderful victory english numbered men of whom be killed wounded hyder force be about loss be not le than victory have immense effect in restoring confidence of english troop have be greatly shaken by misfortune caused by incapacity of munro baillie have other consequence for want of carriage deficiency of provision equipment prevented sir eyre coote from taking offensive be obliged to confine to capturing few fort near coast on th of august army met again hyder having chosen scene of victory over baillie force to give battle believing position to be fortunate one for hyder have now be joined by tippoo who have not be present at last battle force numbered men while english be strong did not see battle a be at time occupied in escorting convoy of provision from madras fight be much better contested than previous battle have be hyder be well acquainted with ground made skilful use of opportunity by fortifying point at must be attacked fight lasted eight hour at last sir eyre coote first division turned enemy left flank by capture of village of pillalore while second turned right hyder be obliged to fall back be done in good order enemy claimed that be drawn battle however be not case a english at night encamped on position occupied by hyder in morning still scandalous mismanagement at madras continued to cripple learning from commandant at vellore that unless be relieved must be driven to surrender for want of provision sir eyre coote marched to help met enemy on way hyder be taken by surprise be moving off when english arrived in order to give infantry time to march away hurled whole of cavalry against english again again charged down with greatest bravery although battery swept rank with grape square received with deadly volley persevered until tippoo have carried off infantry gun then having lost five thousand men followed english then moved on towards vellore hyder avoided encounter vellore be relieved sir eyre coote handed over to commandant almost whole of provision carried by army having thus supplied garrison with sufficient food for six week marched back to madras troop suffering greatly from famine on way nothing took place during winter except sir eyre coote again advanced revictualled vellore in march french fleet arrived off coast landed force of three thousand men to assist hyder informed that much larger division be on way fortunately did not arrive many of ship being captured by english on way out in course of year there be several fight none of consequence thing remained in same state until end of year when on th of december hyder died tippoo be proclaimed successor bussy arrived with fresh reinforcement from france in april took command of hyder french contingent in june there be battle between force commanded by general stuart successor to sir eyre coote who have be obliged to resign from ill health who have died in spring french position be very strong one be protected by numerous field work battle be most sanguinary fought during war considering number engaged english carried portion of work captured fourteen gun a french retired during night be able to claim victory loss however be over thousand while of french be not more than third of number during year there be little fighting down here bombay force however under command of general matthew captured bednore tippoo hastened against with great force besieged bednore forced to surrender after desperate defence tippoo violated term of capitulation made defender prisoner bangalore be next besieged by resisted for nearly nine month only surrendered in january tippoo have by time lost service of french auxiliary a england france have made peace at home negotiation between tippoo english went on till march when treaty be signed by provision tippoo must have handed back prisoner murdered large number of british soldier sepoys obtained liberty one know how many be retained of number calculated at of native carried off from country overrun by hyder troop only be released more british must doubtless have be freed have not be for scandalous cowardice of three men sent up a british commissioner to tippoo be treated with greatest insult contempt by in fear of life be too glad to accept prisoner chose to hand over without troubling in slightest about rest whom basely deserted left to fate chapter war declared that give general idea dick of war with tippoo saw little of event after battle of porto novo a father be taken ill soon after died at madras seeing that there be probability of english driving hyder back until have much larger force much better system of management remained in madras until peace be made then came back here rebuilt palace have since be occupied in trying to restore prosperity of poor people be feel useless task for be certain that ere long english will again be engaged with mysore if be be well nigh certain that tippoo horde will again sweep down from hill carry ruin desolation everywhere must a hyder have have advantage on side at beginning of war have score of pass to choose from can descend on to plain by one may select even be there force here capable of giving battle to whole mysorean army must not watch pass a to do so army must have to be broken up into dozen command tippoo will therefore again be able to ravage plain for week perhaps before english can force to give battle there be army at present in existence of sufficient strength to meet madras force must have to wait until reinforcement arrived from calcutta be bad before will be worse now hyder doubt slaughtered many be not cruel by nature carried off enormous quantity of people with flock herd did to enrich mysore with labour did not treat with unnecessary cruelty tippoo on other hand be human tiger delight in torturing victim slays prisoner from pure love of bloodshed be proud of title of 'tiger ' footstool be tiger head uniform of infantry be sort of imitation of tiger stripe have military talent showed great judgment in command of division indeed most of success gained during last war be work since then have laboured incessantly to improve army number of regiment have be raised composed of captive carried off from here from west coast be drilled in european fashion by english captive still hold in hand why uncle instead of giving time to tippoo to come down here must not march up pass compel to keep army up there to defend seringapatam because dick in first place there be not army strong enough to do so even be there force of fifty thousand men at madras must not take offensive in time english army can not move without great train to carry ammunition store provision to get such train together must be work of month a have be telling during three year last war lasted madras authority be never able to collect train consequence be that army be unable to go more than two three day march from city on other hand tippoo must day order three day supply of rice grain must be served out to soldier must set out on march following morning a from moment reached plain cavalry must have whole of resource of country at mercy see uncle then if war broke out must at once go to madras again there must be nothing else to do dick must send everything of value down there a soon a saw that war be inevitable trader here have already begun to prepare shop be half empty for have not replaced good have sold very few hour must suffice for everything worth taking to be cleared out of town country round here be comparatively uninhabited small portion of tilled so great be number carried off by hyder next time will take to hill at once believe that many have already stored up grain in hiding place there time may be hoped that few week month at most may see tippoo driven back for time peasant can manage to exist in hill doubt richer sort who have large flock of goat many cattle will a soon a danger threatens drive down to madras where be sure to fetch good price for use of army have already told men who have bullock cart team that can if forced to leave home earn good living by taking service in english transport train hope therefore that result will not be so disastrous a before town may be burnt down again unless blow up palace can do little harm to when rebuilt seeing possibility of war must not have wood used in construction therefore when hanging be taken down furniture from room cleared out there will be nothing to burn be not likely to waste powder in blowing up a to town warned people who returned that might be again destroyed before long therefore there have be solid building house have be lightly run up with wood be plentiful enough in hill great harm therefore will be done if be again burnt down pagoda palace be only stone building in did harm to former last time by firing shot at for day two a can see for attempt have since be made to repair suppose will trouble to damage further so see dick be prepared for worst will fight again a did last time uncle know dick show loyalty to english rule by repairing to capital force be too small to render much service see revenue have greatly diminished can not afford to keep up so large force a father must fortunately saving have be considerable from be able to build palace to succour people have still enough to keep up establishment here without pressing cultivator of soil for tax year be first have drawn revenue from source at rate be not disposed to keep up force while must be insufficient to be of great value in war like must be heavy tax on purse even force have must be that uncle not so much a must think dick with english notion pay here be very small so small that must seem to impossible for man to live on yet many of men have wife family of have patch of land that cultivate only twenty who be changed once month being kept on duty be necessary for must have little respect from people le still from other rajah did not have sentry at gate guard ready to turn out in honour of visitor who might arrive to say nothing of escort of dozen men when ride through country of course can be called out whenever want a for example when rode to madras to meet men think well off upon pay of three rupee month a be practically only on duty two month year have rest of time to cultivate field therefore with pay of officer troop only cost about four hundred rupee month be know equivalent to forty english pound so that can not call expensive army even if be kept for show rather than use indeed uncle seems ridiculous that troop of hundred men can be kept up for five hundred pound year of course men have little privilege dick pay rent tax for land be great thing for really cost nothing a there be so much land lying uncultivated then when too old for service have pension of two rupee month for life on what little land can cultivate be comparatively comfortable well doe not seem to uncle soldiering be good trade in country know that be good trade in money way anywhere after pay out here be quite a high in comparison with ordinary rate of earning of peasant a be in england be never pay tempts soldier among young men there be always great number who prefer life to of peasant working steadily from daylight to dark know that altogether blame then think uncle there be doubt that there will be war not shadow of doubt dick indeed may be said to have begun already like last be largely due to incapacity of government of madras have just received message from arcot rajah said two month later must go over see nabob thought mr holland said that tripataly be no longer subject to understood that father be made independent of arcot margaret not exactly that nabob have involved in very heavy debt during great struggle company have done something to help be unable to take debt on shoulder indeed there be reason why must have done so for although during most of war be ally be fighting on own behalf not on theirs in war with hyder be different be then quite under english influence indeed must scarcely be termed independent a suffered terribly land be wasted town besieged people driven off into slavery company be at present engaged in negotiation for assisting to pay debt be very heavy be before left when nabob be much pressed for money have at time claim on company father bought of perpetual commutation of tribute tax other monies subsidy payable by tripataly thus be no longer tributary to arcot nevertheless form portion of nabob territory can not act a if be independent prince must not make treaty with mysore on own account be clear that arcot english must allow to do so for in case mysore must erect fortress here must use tripataly a advanced post on plain therefore be still subject to nabob must be called upon for military service by indeed be one of reason why even if must afford must not care to keep up force of strength a be troop be too small to be worth summoning nabob have remonstrated with more than once since war with hyder have have good excuse namely that population have so decreased that land lie untilled must be impossible for to raise larger force have however agreed that in case of fresh war will raise additional hundred cavalry expect be in relation to that have sent for to arcot know that english be bound by treaty with travancore to declare war ought in honour to have done long ago be unprepared now that be nearly ready may do so at time indeed nabob may have learned that fighting have begun lookout be bad government of madras be just a weak a short sighted a be during hyder war there be one comfort be that lord cornwallis at calcutta have far greater power than predecessor a be experienced soldier be said to be energetic man may bring up reinforcement from calcutta without loss of time also set troop of bombay in motion expect that a before thing will go badly at first hope that time will end by giving mysore so heavy lesson that will be powerless for mischief in future release captive mr holland exclaimed clasping hand sincerely trust so margaret brother said gravely after what happened last time must not be sanguine scattered about a may be in score of little hill fort that dot whole country can unhappily never be sure that be delivered when have only word of treacherous tyrant like tippoo know that last time kept back hundred of prisoner among whom a may hope be husband may be that however completely may be defeated may yet retain of knowing full well be impossible that hill fort dungeon can be searched however doubtless if english army march to seringapatam many will be recovered though have reason to fear that many will a before be murdered before arrival when rajah returned from arcot on following day brought back news that general meadow have moved to frontier at caroor fifty mile beyond trichinopoly that war be really about to begin know said how matter stand up to now tippoo after making peace with nizam mahratti with whom have be engaged in hostility for time turned attention to western coast where coorg malabar have risen in rebellion after a usual perpetrating horrible atrocity after sending large proportion of population a slave to mysore marched against travancore now travancore be specially mentioned in treaty of mangalore a one of ally of english with whom tippoo bound not to make war have not be prepared to fight english must not have attacked ally excuse for attacking travancore be that of fugitive from coorg malabar have taken refuge there seeing that tippoo be bent upon hostility lord cornwallis council at calcutta directed a learnt from official at authority there to begin at once to make preparation for war instead of doing so mr holland governor gave rajah shameful cowardly advice to withdraw protection from fugitive rajah refused to comply with such counsel after month spent in negotiation tippoo attacked wall run along northern frontier of travancore be about six month ago yes be on th of december so be just six month troop fourteen thousand strong made way without difficulty through breach be suddenly attacked by small body of travancore men panic seized rushed back to breach in wild struggle to pas through le than two be either killed crushed to death be nearly three month before tippoo renewed attack line be weak army so strong that resistance be impossible breach three quarter of mile in length be made in wall marching through devastated travancore from end to end unaccountable delay before assaulting position have be of great advantage to have attacked at once instead of wasting time before travancore must have found carnatic a defenceless a completely at mercy a hyder did must still have done so have depended upon madras a authority here did nothing lord cornwallis took matter into own hand be about to come here when general meadow formerly governor of bombay arrived invested by company with office of governor of commander in chief landed here late in february at once set to work to prepare for war lord cornwallis sent from calcutta large amount of money store ammunition battalion of artilleryman sepoys

whom be very heavily in debt to government be ordered during continuance of war to place revenue at disposal liberal allowance being made to for personal expense tippoo be still in travancore at least be there ten day ago have be endeavouring to negotiate nabob tell belief that object of general meadow in advancing from trichinopoly to caroor be to push on to coimbatoor where will if arrives before tippoo cut off from return to capital a meadow have force of fifteen thousand men ought to be able to crush tyrant at blow fear however there be little chance of mysore troop move with great rapidity a soon a tippoo hears that english army be marching towards caroor be sure to take alarm by time have probably passed coimbatoor on way back with fault tippoo be good general nabob opinion quite agree with be that a soon a regains table land of mysore will take advantage of english army being far away to south will pour down through pass into part of carnatic be at present absolutely defenceless being case will at once get ready to leave for madras will move a soon a learn for certain that tippoo have slipped past english nabob have called upon to join with little body of cavalry a soon a

be of little use to nabob if tippoo come down from hill will not be able to take field against will need force to defend arcot vellore smaller fort cavalry must be of real use to troop must be of much greater utility to battalion from bengal when arrive will be here in three week so a soon a come will attach to will write to nabob saying that be about to join that in interest of general defence have thought better at present to attach to bengal contingent see will be entirely new to country will be great advantage to to have troop like yours many of whom be well acquainted with road general geography of country speaking english too will add to usefulness have nephew with who speaks english perfectly also hindustani rajah said be smart young fellow have doubt that officer in command must be able to make very useful be eager to be of service father who be englishman be wrecked year ago on west coast sent up prisoner to mysore be not one of handed over at time of peace whether have be murdered be still prisoner in tippoo hand know sister came out with boy three four month ago to endeavour to obtain news of will make note of have doubt that will be of great use to colonel cockerell

small party of horse tippoo might send down by of pass to reconnoitre country ascertain movement strength of british force be also to endeavour to obtain a much information a must of what be going on in mysore to ascertain whether tippoo be still with army watching general meadow in west be moving a if with intention of taking advantage of main force of english being away south to descend into carnatic order be very acceptable one to rajah troop made good appearance enough when in company with of nabob of arcot must not feel that looked motley body by side of trained native european troop be frequently angered by hearing jeering comment of english soldier to other when rode past with troop have not little astonished speaker more than once by turning round on horse abusing hotly in own language be therefore glad to be off for such work men be far better fitted than be even native cavalry in company service be stout active fellow accustomed to hill speaking dialect used by shepherd villager among ghauts proceeding northward through vellore there divided force into four body with fifty men took up position at mouth of pas of amboor fifty be sent to pas of moognee to west of chittoor under command of captain of troop rest be distributed among minor pass dick remained with uncle who established in village seven mile up pas be well satisfied with arrangement for be anxious to learn to go about among hill a spy be much more likely to get leave from uncle to do so than must have be from of officer of troop who must not have ventured to allow rajah nephew to run into danger in second place especial friend among officer youth named surajah son of rajbullub be with detachment surajah have be especially picked out by rajah a dick companion generally joined in ride have often gone on shooting excursion among hill be about three year dick senior in point of height there be little difference between day troop under officer rode up pas until within mile of fort near summit garrisoned by mysorean troop be able to obtain little information for village towards upper end of pas be deserted in ruin inhabitant never having ventured back since hyder invasion rajah be vexed at being able to learn nothing of what be passing on plateau be therefore more disposed than might otherwise have be to listen to dick proposal think uncle latter said one evening might try to learn something by going up with surajah alone must strike off into hill a if on shooting expedition just a used to do from tripataly except must stain face hand people in village on top of ghauts be one say simple quiet have love for tippoo mysore be content to pay tax to work quietly in field there will be little fear of being interfered with by might find party of tippoo troop in one of village dick get into trouble see why must uncle of course must not go up dressed a be a shikarees when went into village must begin by asking whether people be troubled with tiger in neighbourhood see specially came out here to go into mysore in disguise must be getting little practice in way besides obtaining news for be certainly anxious to get news dick so far have have nothing to send down except that report from pass agree in saying that have learned nothing of movement on part of tippoo that spy have come down pass armed party whatever be good so far a go only show that other pass be like entirely deserted therefore really know nothing even at moment tippoo may have fifty thousand men gathered on crest of hill ready to pour down tomorrow through one of pass therefore a think must be running great danger consent to going with surajah on scouting expedition on foot among hill a say must of course disguise yourselves a peasant have better in addition to gun take brace of pistol so armed even if of villager be inclined to be hostile must not care about interfering with thank uncle when must expect back if start tomorrow morning must be entirely in hand dick must hardly climb ghauts light upon village in one day might be necessary to go farther before must obtain news be broken country with much jungle for distance beyond hill village lying off road will have little communication with other might know nothing whatever of what be happening in cultivated plain beyond at rate must not go into village on road leading to head of pass for there be fort everywhere must be certain to find party of troop stationed in even before war broke out know that be case a be stationed there to prevent captive native european escaping from mysore must therefore strictly avoid main road even though may be necessary to proceed much farther before can get news must think if say three day going a many returning will be a little a can count upon will not begin to feel at uneasy if reappear for week be of use returning without information a to what be going on in mysore must be folly to throw away work trouble when in day two might get news want will therefore leave entirely to discretion greatly pleased at having succeeded beyond expectation dick at once sought out surajah latter be very gratified when heard that be to accompany young sahib on expedition at once set about necessary preparation there be difficulty in obtaining in village clothes required for disguise one of sheep intended for following day ration be killed leg boiled if take in addition to ten pound of flour gourd of ghee little pan for frying cake in will be able to get on without having to buy food for four five day of course when be once among village will have difficulty in getting more have better cut meat off bone divide in two portion divide flour too then can carry share will willingly carry sahib not at surajah will take fair share see will have gun pistol ammunition tulwar that with seven eight pound of food water bottle will be quite enough to carry up ghauts only thing want now be stain will get something will do bring with in morning sahib wo take minute to put on will come for at first gleam of daylight dick returned to cottage occupied with uncle told what preparation have made for journey sat talking over detail for hour rajah last word a lay down for night be forget to take blanket will want for sleeping in open will probably have to do several time although may occasionally be able to find shelter in village by time sun rose next morning be well upon way have good deal of toilsome climbing by have surmounted most difficult portion of ascent encamped when became dark in small wood here lighted fire cooked cake of flour with cold meat made hearty meal have during day halted twice have breakfasted lunched off bread of have brought sufficient for day journey suppose there be occasion to watch surajah know sahib think will be safe for to sleep there be a know many tiger among hill though must not approach a long a fire be burning brightly might steal up carry one of off when fire get low will therefore watch certainly must not let do without taking turn dick said feel so tired with day work that think must keep awake for ten minute must be better to sleep in tree than that must not get much sleep in tree sahib have done once twice when have be hunting in tiger infested neighbourhood got scarcely sleep be so stiff in morning must hardly walk must rather sit up night keep up good fire than do that dick thought for minute two then got up walked about under tree keeping eye fixed upon branch overhead will do said at last come here surajah there do see two branch coming out in same direction at one point be five six foot apart might fasten blanket side by side with help of strap of water bottle sling of gun so a to make what be called on board ship hammock lie there perfectly safe comfortable surajah nodded have coil of leather thong sahib thought that might be useful if wanted to bind prisoner for other purpose so stuffed into waist sash be good let lose time for be quite ready for sleep will climb up first in ten minute blanket be securely fastened side by side between branch surajah descended threw armful of wood on to fire placed meat in crutch of bough six foot above ground then climbed tree again thus be soon lying side by side in blanket bagged rather inconveniently under weight be too tired to mind trifle be very soon fast asleep dick did not wake until surajah called be already broad daylight companion have slipped down quietly stirred up ember of fire thrown on more wood cooked chupatties before waking be too bad surajah dick said a looked down ought to have woke will unfasten blanket before get

village lad surajah asked be way be shikarees be there tiger about plenty of boy said drive goat to strong high stockade evening must not come out before sun rose for money say sultan have make for tree close to will see spring follow down will take to village after walking for six hour came to village be place of little size there be few people about woman came to door to look at surajah dick a came along where be from old man asked a came out from cottage from down mountain side tiger be getting scarce there thought must come over see what must do here here there be many tiger old man said for last twenty year war have taken most of young men away be forced to go against will for when order come to head man of village that sultan requires so many soldier be forced to pick out best fitted for service others go of own free will thinking soldiering easier work than tilling field besides chance of getting rich booty so there be few shikarees tiger multiply be curse to be poor people if choose to stay here for time will pay something for tiger kill will send round to other village within ten mile doubtless one of will contribute so that might get enough to pay for exertion will think of surajah replied did not intend to stop in one village proposed to travel about in jungle covered district wherever hear complaint of tiger committing depredation will stop do best to kill evil beast mean first to find out where be most troublesome then will work back again hear that sultan give good price for taken alive have heard so old man said none have be caught alive here by anyone in village round sultan generally get from royal forest where none be allowed to shoot save with permission sometimes when there be lack of there hunter come into district catch in pitfall have

formed of low bank of beaten earth with thick covering of straw be simple enough surajah said one of must take order on sultan treasury to large village down in plain must go to trader say that wished to purchase so much grain other good must pay for with order on sultan treasury must probably be accepted a readily a cash for trader must send to merchant banker at seringapatam to get cashed for to pay for good have obtained there to send balance there might be to retain for further purchase order of kind be better than money for trading purpose for there must be fear of being stolen on way a must be hidden in hair shoe anywhere among clothes of messenger wonderful old peasant said word be relief indeed to will be to village when hear now dick broke in let talk about tiger while have be speaking soldier have passed door twice have be looking suspiciously at house if take into head to come here to ask who be what be business must not do to tell that have be discussing value of order

questioning a to tiger place of retreat whether pitfall kid a decoy must be most suitable where do come from officer asked surajah live in little village distance down ghauts heard that tiger be more abundant in jungle country up here than be below thought that must for time follow calling here can get good price for skin down below with what get from village for freeing from tiger hope in few month to take back good store of money story be doubtful one officer said harshly may be what say may be spy if have be spy surajah said must not be here at bangalore seringapatam village be not place where news be to be gained be so self evident that officer have nothing to say against at rate said after pause there be confirmation to story a have order to put suspicious person under arrest will detain be very hard surajah began officer made impatient gesture while two of soldier put hand on shoulder of prisoner led from hut need not look so downcast one of said good naturedly suppose will be kept here long will doubt be released when sultan have gone down pass with army week two here will do harm tiger can wait for bit there give weapon daresay will get back again when go on a hope will do for there be nothing to eat nothing to do in miserable place arm be taken into officer hut a there be sentry at gate further attention be paid to will get provision bring in old man said be hard indeed that men can not go about business without being interfered with thank have enough for two three day when be gone will give money to buy more for have few rupee with a knew might be time before must be able to kill tiger a soon a old man have left seated on large faggot of wood have be brought in by villager for fuel can not stay here surajah be most important that must get back with news have doubt that pig headed brute in there will do a say will hold prisoner until tippoo have gone down pass must get off tonight if possible be not likely to be looked after very sharply think that fellow really suspect be simply keeping to show authority there ought to be difficulty in getting out suppose will be put into one of soldier hut tonight if crawl out when be asleep have only to make way up narrow step to top of wall then let down other side be not above fifteen foot high even if dropped must not be likely to hurt there will most likely be sentry at gate surajah observed there be moon tonight there ought to be difficulty in pouncing on suddenly gagging before can give alarm then tying will walk round see if there be rope lying about if not will tear sash into strip can use yours to lower over wall must like to get weapon if must gun matter pistol be good one if there be alarm given may have to fight besides be not impossible that may come across tiger a go along vote that when have secured sentry pay officer visit surajah nodded be quite ready to agree to anything dick might suggest felt strong desire to repossess of arm for seemed to that must be humiliation to go back without of course dick went on if sentry give alarm before can secure must give up part of plan for in case must have to bolt once over wall must be right may fire away at a run there be fear of hitting half asleep a will be not quite sure what be about if get fair start of need not have much fear of catching not a long a be straight running sahib if follow far may come up within range of a be making way down of nasty place where came up face of ghaut if once get well away from will hide up somewhere then strike off on line might do surajah agreed know place where came up be only one seemed to climbable must be certainly better to make for again if can find way quite agree with there surajah must never do to go find on edge of precipice that must not get down with soldier anywhere near besides be of greatest importance that must take news back a soon a possible a hour may be of importance only wish must find out pas tippoo mean to go by suppose will be known until start for anyhow news will be very valuable for at present be supposed to be over on other side must have taken troop entirely by surprise if have suddenly poured out onto plain so must give up idea of hiding up for if did so must have to lie there day must mean loss of twenty four hour for must not go down ghauts for money except in daylight be very different thing going downhill to going up if be to attempt in dark must break neck for certainty if can get away early tonight will be at edge of steep place by nine o'clock in morning if strike right point might be back to rajah by nightfall will be difficult to find way back in dark surajah said doubt still can keep in general direction even if hit upon stream tonight will find in morning be late in afternoon when reached village be now growing dark two soldier came up to bade follow into one of hut there pointed to farther corner a place wrapped in blanket at once lay down if take into head dick whispered to surajah to put sentry on guard at door will upset plan must not be very difficult to cut way through mud wall behind in first place have taken away knife even if have must be risky work trying chance be that will sit talk night of course might surprise sentry must be great risk with fellow close at hand must have to run straight for step might get dozen ball after before be over wall think there must be much chance of hitting surajah said jumping up from sleep in confusion must be minute so before must find out what have happened must be at foot of step before saw then must fire almost at random in case must lose weapon added regretfully can not help that arm be of consequence at compared to getting away unless of course of happen to overtake for three four hour soldier of whom there be ten in hut sat eating talking smoking round fire kept burning on earthen floor one by one however left lay down when three remained one of got up with grumble of discontent took musket be leaning against wall went out of hut what nuisance dick whispered be evidently going on sentry duty perhaps have gone to gate surajah suggested be afraid not expect other hut be furnishing sentry there listen during pause of low conversation of two men still sitting by fire must hear footfall outside settle question dick said now sooner fellow go to sleep better have better wait for time after do surajah replied one two of men who lay down first be sure to get up go to door look out always do once twice during night sentry will soon get accustomed to door being opened wo look round sharp be good idea dick agreed moon be at back of hut so will be in shadow will spring upon will try grip by throat so that ca holloa wrench musket from hand snatch belt of cartridge will give weapon anyhow a soon a have got will give one sharp squeeze throw down will be time before get breath enough to holloa in hour two men by fire lay down be not long before a surajah predicted one of sleeper sat up stretched then rose walked to door opened stood at entrance moment later be joined by figure for few minute stood talking together then came in again shut door lay down during next hour three of others followed example last of leaving door ajar behind when came in now be chance surajah must give ten minute to fall asleep again then will move must one of be lying awake notice be not likely for be too dark in here to see figure distinctly ask where be going say 'to door to get cool wo imagine that be thinking of escape with one sentry at door at gate think sahib that must be safer to kill sentry safer not surajah will not do at present have done harm be only acting a officer ordered have grudge against when take to shooting at must shoot at to kill sentry must be nothing short of murder after waiting few minute longer dick said have better be off now if be to wait longer must have fellow getting up rose quietly to foot made way to door opened noiselessly sentry be standing leaning on long matchlock few foot away suddenly voice behind exclaimed who be that sentry be in act of turning round when dick sprang upon grasped by throat cry came from man lip gun fell from grasp a clutched convulsively at dick wrist went off a fell pick up dick shouted run released grip from man throat snatched bandolier from shoulder tripping foot from under threw heavily to ground then turned to run whole have occupied few second a started soldier ran out from hut shouting loudly have gun in hand dick changed mind turned threw upon wrenched gun from hold a man staggered back struck with right hand under chin man fell back through open door a if shot dick seized handle closed then ran at full speed towards foot of step be twenty yard away up go surajah have not moment to lose dick sprang up step surajah following a reached top of wall shot be discharged at by sentry at gate who ignorant of cause of sudden uproar have be standing in readiness to fire be however too excited to take aim bullet flew harmlessly over head in instant sprang over parapet lower by arm then drop wall like many others of sort be thicker at base than on top foot projected two foot beyond upper line so that be sharp slide rather than absolute fall be well that be so for although only twelve foot high inside be eight foot higher on outer face a dry ditch encircled came down in heap on sand have crumbled from face of wall a soon a picked up dick exclaimed keep along foot of wall surajah dashed along until reached angle a turned corner heard burst of voice from wall where have slid down several shot be fired dick led way along ditch to next angle then left entered village dashed along street sound of firing have roused many of peasant door be opening men coming out exclamation of surprise be heard a two figure rushed past one thought of interfering with a left house behind surajah said be going wrong way sahib be going right away from ghauts know well enough dick panted did on purpose will turn work round again will hear from villager that have come way will be following down road while be making way back to ghauts ran for hundred yard then quitted path made across field from fort village must hear great hubbub above must make out voice of officer shouting order continued to run for quarter of mile then turned now can go quietly dick said breaking into walk line will take clear of fort village have only to make straight for ghauts think have thrown well off scent unless officer suspect that have only gone other way to deceive that be really making for ghauts will hear nothing more of be capital surajah said must not think what be doing when turned round corner of fort made for village instead of going other way where did get that gun from dick told how have come into possession be not so much that cared for gun said a wanted to prevent man from using if have followed closely must hardly have helped hitting one of a went up step by shutting door gained few moment for be in confusion in dim light inside must certainly not learn anything from man pitched in among from sentry outside suppose of have idea of what have happened until sentry shouted to that have got over wall then rushed up fired at random from top thinking that must be running straight from walked along for short distance then dick said have got wind again now will go on at jog trot mistrust officer have crafty face a said belonged to village down ghauts may have suspicion that have be trying to throw off scent think must be sure to double back make for home kept on way sometimes dropping into walk generally going at easy trot until day broke a soon a get little lighter surajah will go up on to one of rise so a to have good look down over line have come if be following must go on at top of speed if see nothing of can take quietly of course ca have be following step be quite likely that of villager may know that ghauts can be climbed at point where came up know noticed sign of path two three time on way up in case if officer really did think of pursuing must take one of villager a guide hour later ascended sharp rise threw down on crest think that there be least chance of coming surajah said carelessly when have gone distance without overtaking on road may possibly have suspected that have turned made way by time got back to village must know well enough that there be chance of overtaking dick made answer have sort of uneasy conviction that officer must at once suspect plan that pursuit must have commenced very shortly after have re passed fort for minute word be spoken sign of life be to be seen in so broken country covered in many place with jungle wood considerable body of men might be coming up unperceived suddenly dick grasped surajah arm there be see be right look at clump of bush half mile away well to left of line came by have just come out from there there be ten twelve of see surajah said be running too not very fast will crawl back till be out of sight then make run for must have got guide be doubt taking more direct line than be for may be good bit off stream followed a came along have not seen anything recognise since got light though be sure have be going somewhere near right direction now have got to run for dashed off at rate of speed much higher than at have before be travelling keeping a much a possible in ground covered from sight of pursuer bearing somewhat to left so a to place latter directly behind to strike path dick have doubt pursuer be keeping be use running too fast said few minute later there be good long way to go yet ten mile must think anyhow think can get down steep place before come to edge of cliff above see be not certain a to where be might strike cliff mile two on side of have doubt will go straight to spot expect man have got a guide have be in habit of going down ghauts know way if be not that be in such hurry to get to uncle with news about tippoo must be much better to turn off stay in wood for day two must not stop very long at top of ghauts for can not be sure that be going that way at when few hour passed did come officer must suppose that be mistaken that really kept on in line on started trotted along for time in silence then surajah said do not think that must be better for to make for pas to left be twenty mile off must be there by evening must surely find way of getting into below where fort stand dick stopped running why not go other way make for pas know said ca be more than fifteen mile at outside once below fort know way must get down to village twelve hour sooner than if went round by other pas must be right plan if must do surajah agreed know rock rise straight up on side of fort road pass up through narrow cleft with fort standing at mouth be why proposed other pas think have better try nevertheless surajah must not be more than three hour in going straight there will have ample time to follow edge of precipice for last five mile may discover break where can get down if must find impossible to descend anywhere must sleep till sunset then strike road above fort go down at night manage to slip past sentry only thing be sahib that seemed a if fort lay right across entrance to gorge road went through did look like surajah certainly road went through gateway there must be break somewhere must see that in wet season lot of water come down there so there must be sort of passage for if passage be big enough for storm water to go through must be big enough for surajah agreed turned off from line that have before be following no longer hurrying walking at leisurely pace be not pressed for time there be chance whatever of pursuit a have be going for six hour at top of speed be feeling exhausted after proceeding for two mile came upon small stream here sat down lighted fire mixed flour water for although ghee have be taken from when be disarmed have be allowed to retain supply of flour for sustenance in prison made small cake cooked in glowing ember must not be termed success for outside be burned black while centre be pasty mass however sufficed to satisfy hunger after hour rest again went forward be not very long before stood on edge of rock wall followed along must nowhere find spot where descent seemed at possible after walking for hour saw road winding up long valley below be road dick exclaimed that clump of house surajah must be one where generally turned know that from below rock looked a steep a wall so there be chance of finding way down anywhere between fort surajah nodded to also ascent of ghauts have seemed impracticable be use following line more dick went on may a well strike across until come onto edge of pas somewhere above fort find place where can descend easily then lie down sleep till be time to make attempt in hour be looking down on road mile so above fort slope here be gradual must be descended without least difficulty even in dark there do see surajah water course run along by side of road there be little water in now know used to meet with down below water horse at pool close to ruined village when start can follow road until get close to fort then crawl along in water course take chance if must find so blocked up that ca get through must then see how can get past place in other way if gate be only barred doubt must be able to overpower sentry get gate open before alarm be given if be locked must do best can may calculate upon taking sentry by surprise a did in prison on silencing at once then must have time to break up cartridge pour powder into keyhole be sure to be big one make slow match blow lock open must make slow match before start if have water will go down to stream get have nothing to carry up in surajah besides someone might come along valley will only want little water will take off sash dip in stream will give plenty when be wrung out at rate surajah will hing until be getting dusk see there be peasant with three bullock coming down valley there be four armed horseman riding behind will go back to bush hundred yard behind sleep there until sunset then will make way down to heap of boulder close to stream manufacture slow match hide up there until be time to start want rest badly did not sleep last night if get through must push on tonight without stop so must have good sleep now sun be low when woke watched dip below hill then after waiting until began to get dusk started for valley one be to be seen on road ran rapidly down slope until reached heap of boulder surajah tore off strip of cotton six inch long by inch wide from bottom of dress went forward to stream wetted when came back squeezed moisture from broke up cartridge rubbed powder into cotton then rolled up longways will be dry enough by time want to start dick said hope sha' have to use if there be other way must do so remained where be until thought that garrison of fort must be for most part asleep then crossed stream walked along by side of road taking care not to show upon a figure must be seen for long distance on white dusty surface presently side of valley approached more closely to other just where narrowed must make out number of dark object be doubted not house occupied by garrison at once took to bed of stream stooping low a went so that body must be indistinguishable among rock must hear murmur of voice a passed through village once beyond entered gorge here there be room enough for road stream whose bed be several foot below causeway few hundred yard farther gorge widened out bit in moonlight must see wall of fort stretching before square building standing close to be guard house doubt dick said in low tone be too close to be pleasant if have to attack sentry very carefully picked way among rock until close to wall then dick gave low exclamation of disappointment stream ran through culvert twelve foot wide ten foot high be closed by iron bar crossing other at interval of only five six inch lower end of perpendicular bar being fixed in stone dam extending across bed of stream dick waded across pool formed by dam felt bar found perfectly solid strong be good surajah said when returned there be getting through there there be nothing for gate unless can find step up to top of wall get up unnoticed then might tear up sash longways knot together slip down first thing to do be to have look round will get up close to wall be in shadow there entering pool again climbed up steep bank be here faced with stone stopped when eye be above level looked round there be gate twelve foot away to delight sentry be to be seen be about to whisper surajah to join when heard voice came from above at once understood that instead of man being posted behind gate two be on guard on wall above beckoned to surajah to join when did so whispered what have discovered if gate be only barred be right now surajah except that will have to run risk of being shot by fellow on wall will be pretty easy mark on white road by moonlight only plan will be to keep close to wall when be through gate get down into bed of stream again then crawl along among rock bottom will be in shadow may get off without being noticed only fear be that will make noise in opening gate now let try keeping close to wall crept to gateway projected two foot beyond gate standing against latter must not be seen even in unlikely event of one of sentry looking down only risk be of anyone in guard house coming out however must not be avoided at once began to examine fastening of gate consisted of two massive bar of wood running across by united strength removed one after when tried found gate still immovable beastly thing be locked dick said there be nothing to do to blow open broke off end of three cartridge poured powder in at keyhole then inserted slow match stand in corner there surajah will go down to stream again to light tinder noise be le likely to be heard there stole back again sat down at edge of water placed tinder box in lap took turban off put over hand so a to deaden sound then struck steel sharply against flint first blow be successful spark fell on tinder at once began to extend listened intently men on wall be still talking sound have evidently not reached ear chapter besieged dick hastily clambered up wall ran to gate blew tinder then applied to slow match moment later began to fizz round corner of wall surajah exclaimed running back few anxious second passed then came sharp explosion in instant ran up gate stood two three inch open yielded to push ran out loud shout be heard from men above hubbub of cry from guard house run surajah must risk keep on edge of road dodge a go chance be will run down below to see what have happened at top of speed dashed down road shot be fired from wall dick conjecture that first impulse of sentry must be to run down below having be justified be couple of hundred yard away before two shot be fired from gate bullet whistled by harmlessly be right now dick cried can scarcely see will soon be out of sight altogether five six more shot be fired few second later a men from guard house reached gate on looking back when have gone hundred yard saw number of figure on road not quite so fast surajah dick said be going to be long chase now have got three hundred yard start wo be able to load again running at full speed for time pursuer gained somewhat upon then gradually began to straggle a effect of speed at be running told upon when reached ruined village there be four men running together three hundred yard behind rest be considerable distance in rear mile two will give up chase except four surajah if turn out better runner than do can make stand there be more hut two mile farther will fight there be going slower now for although downward course of road helped good deal run be telling on not word be spoken until reached second village when came to first house stopped simultaneously looked round pursuer be not more than two hundred yard behind in here surajah dick said a ran into ruined hut roof be gone door hung loose on hinge have one window small one looking up valley dick laid gun on sill be nearly level with shoulder must wait until get pretty close said for be panting so ca keep barrel steady even with rest will kneel down outside surajah said mind will fire first surajah fire until be within twenty yard of by time will have loaded again dick have more time than have expected for a soon a pursuer saw enter hut slackened pace considerably be within about eighty yard when dick held breath standing for moment immovable took steady aim fired one of men stumbled in run took step two forward then fell on face others paused for moment then with fierce yell ran forward moment have fired dick dropped stock of gun on to ground snatched cartridge from bandolier bit off end emptied powder into barrel gave gun shake so a to be sure that ran into touch hole then rammed down bullet a be in act of doing so surajah fired loud yell told that shot have be successful dick sprang to door a surajah entered two shot at same instant rang out at even so short distance bullet went wide dick stepped out in turn fired one of two men fell other threw down musket fled up road thank goodness be over dick exclaimed thought have chance with here now first thing be to get wind again stood for two three minute breathing heavily then a breath came again prepared to move when dick exclaimed suddenly what be noise there be dull confused sound in air then surajah pointing up road exclaimed cavalry far away on white road dark mass must be seen at first dick instinctively turned to resume flight then said be of use surajah side of valley be too steep to climb will be up in five six minute must fight out here run out to man shot bring in gun bandolier pistol if have sword will take from two will make difference having spare weapon surajah without word hurried up road while dick ran over to house opposite seemed to be larger than one have first entered looked round contained only one room be twenty foot square there be three small window one looking into street one looking up valley one behind floor be littered with beam of roof door be still in place having ascertained ran back to body of two men picked up three gun took off bandolier removed pistol from sash with one of sword returned to house just a surajah came back be best house to defend surajah there be beam with can block up door laying down arm inside set to work with beam barricaded door so firmly that short of being splintered to piece entry must be effected done re charged six gun examined pistol finding that be loaded placed three of in of sash hung sword by side then went to window looking up valley horseman twenty in number be short quarter of mile away be coming along at gallop fire surajah dick said will have heard from man who have got away that be in house opposite if find there will think that have gone on will ride down valley till be sure must be ahead of then will search ground carefully a come back altogether may gain hour moment be of use must be two o'clock now troop generally get here soon after seven a spoke horseman drew up in front of opposite hut there be momentary pause then voice said be empty then followed command ride on men ca have got very far will overtake in ten minute a soon a started dick said take ramrod surajah make hole through wall to fire through if be to show at window might get shot wall be built of mud clay with iron ramrod have difficulty in making four hole inch wide two inch high on side of house now be ready for dick said when have finished have be gone hour wo be long before be back in few minute heard clatter of horse hoof ceased forty fifty yard away by sound of voice order be evident that other house be being searched voice be also heard at back of house guessed that ground be being closely examined up to foot of rock wall enclosed valley now surajah can take shot from window of side others will be here in minute be just a well to let know where be before get close up to door surajah went to window at back four horseman be making way at walk along level ground between rock hut nearest be forty yard away surajah fired man at once fell from horse others instantly galloped on at full speed up valley from window at end surajah saw gather on road three four hundred yard away then after short consultation cross to other side of valley with intention have doubt of rejoining comrade sound of gun have be followed by shout exclamation from party in village dick must hear conference in low tone then be silent went to loophole at corner laid rifle in waited looking along barrel two three minute later hole be darkened fired at once there be sound of heavy fall followed by cry of rage moment later there be rush of men against door surajah ran across two spare gun be pushed through loophole one on side of have not be bored straight through wall at angle must enable to fire at anyone attacking looking along barrel must see one of group in front fired at same moment with yell of rage surprise assailant of door sprang back ran down street there be four le anyhow dick said a surajah reloaded empty gun loophole will puzzle think will care to come on again for bit there be pause for minute then from hut opposite from various point higher up valley behind dropping fire be opened keep out of line of window do surajah will be just a well to lie down for bit until see whether of shot come through wall think be quite safe from distant fire from house opposite be possible may penetrate anyhow stand in line of loophole stray ball might find way in for few minute enemy fired away unanswered then dick who have be seated on ground with back against end wall got up went along facing street carefully examining think of ball have come through surajah must be able to see out into moonlight if have done so now be time for to be doing something expect be getting little bolder will perhaps give chance take loophole be exactly in line with opposite hut fellow in there must come to door to fire will take slanting hole by doorpost can see one of window of next hut to that be in have doubt that be firing from there also wait for to shoot fire directly figure show in very short time surajah fired dick heard clatter of gun a fell to ground have hit surajah yes only wounded think hit on shoulder let gun drop ran into house take spare gun at once if there be others there will think that be loading may show again moment later dick saw gun thrust out through window be watching then head shoulder of man appeared behind fired figure disappeared almost at same instant surajah fired again have one time sahib be now quiet for little time then horseman dashed suddenly past galloped up valley at full speed end window surajah bring down if can surajah ran there fired have missed said in tone of deep disappointment doe not make much difference if have hit must have sent off close to opposite side of valley there be doubt a to what have gone for see have lost six killed one wounded must know that have not slightest chance of taking hut have doubt that have ridden back to bring down infantry from fort from number of hut round gate sound of talking must think there be fifty sixty at least perhaps hundred if send down fifty will have sharp work difficulty will be to prevent from making rush at window together if be to get there must riddle with ball must block up sahib be just what be thinking dick replied might try anyhow will be hour half before be down here must be past four now in hour daylight will begin to break there be amount of old thatch down on floor best way must be to fill up window hole with first then to put two three bit of wood across strong piece down behind to keep in place by wedging one of long beam against if came up tried to pull thatch out must fire through with pistol will make loophole below when have got work done be not so difficult business a thought must be window be little more than foot across two foot high be work of few minute to fill up with mass of thatch when be done picked out thick piece of wood for crossbar then took beam eight foot long made hole with tulwars in clay floor close to wall put one end of beam into reared upright against window dick held in place while surajah hacked deep notch in by mean difficult matter for be half rotten with exposure notch be cut just opposite middle of window three crosspiece be then put into place upright pressed firmly against one end of long beam be placed in notch other in slight hole made in ground thus forming strut held rest firmly in position be good job done dick said very hot one now surajah sharpen three four piece of wood drive down into ground at foot of strut then will be a firm a rock then proceeded in same way with other two window be getting light fast dick said a wiped perspiration from face take look out up valley ought to be coming by time surajah applied eye to one of loophole can see said be mile away there be two mounted men expect one be officer other man who rode back to fetch let set to work at loophole under window surajah be most important to get done make one at end will do one looking into street put a close to beam a can worked hard be not long before wall be pierced now surajah do one at back fellow will soon be within range will give lesson to be careful will naturally break up go round behind house opposite a can find shelter nowhere else for bit at rate will get on one side of be what want dick carried six gun to end of hut then applied eye to loophole there enemy be coming along at run in confused mass ca very well miss muttered to a thrust gun through loophole fired without waiting to see result thrust gun out aimed fired never mind hole surajah said come here reload four other shot be discharged in rapid succession mysoreans at first opened irregular fire on hut when sixth shot be fired left road in body ran across valley leaving four of number on ground behind a soon a gun be reloaded surajah returned to work be now broad daylight sun be shining upon hilltop quarter of hour passed without movement from enemy dick companion occupied time in further strengthening door with crossbeam kept in place by strut if break to splinter dick said when have finished will hardly be able to force way in for if be to try to crawl in between crossbeam must be completely at mercy now must get ready for rush expect will come together there be six gun three pistol keep one of latter in reserve ought not to waste shot if lose ten men must think will give up attack on door stand clear of surajah will probably fire into before charge keep down below level of loophole presently volley of musketry be fired door be riddled by bullet then number of figure sprang from between two opposite house rushed at door two of carried long heavy beam two shot flashed out in return from hut one of men carrying beam fell a did officer who be leading instantly caught up end of timber in moment crowd be clustered round door several caught hold of beam swung a though meant to use a battering ram two more puff of smoke spurted out from loophole again two of men fell others however swung forward with crash against door end of beam went right through rotten woodwork dick surajah fired last musket shot with a deadly effect a before next blow dashed door from hinge split shattered by former shock fell forward into road while yell of triumph broke from mysoreans died away however when saw three crossbar blocking entrance again two pistol shot carried death among load gun surajah before surajah have time to do so mysoreans made rush at door defender stepped forward fired between crossbar then drawing tulwars ran two men in front through body a dropped behind drew back last pistol dick shouted fired two shot into crowd completed consternation of enemy seemed to that defender possessed unlimited supply of firearm already twelve shot have be fired not one have failed to take effect with cry of consternation fled down street leaving ground in front of fatal door strewn with body defender instantly set about work of recharging firearm be not interrupted presently irregular fire opened upon from jungle have taken place of garden between opposite house may a well lie down at full length dick said setting example there be use in running risk keep that side listen attentively be likely enough that will work round behind next time try window by way be firing fancy there be not more than five six of opposite half hour passed then surajah exclaimed can hear on side dick got up crossed at once will take loophole under window go to one at end expect will try window at once dick placed muzzle of gun in loophole glancing along saw that something dark barred view fired at once there be loud cry fall then rush to window moment later hole appeared in thatch dick discharged two pistol through a did so surajah fired thatch be speedily pulled down a enemy have learned to avoid loophole yell of rage rose a fallen thatch showed that window be defended with crossbar in same way a door immediately afterwards dick have narrow escape from shot fired through loophole close to stoop down cried crouching below level of loophole made way to end of hut recharge gun first surajah may fire away through loophole a long a like be lucky made so high except three under window must be careful in keeping out of line of sit down where can command end window one behind will watch front window door bold fellow might put musket through pick one of off be what have to prevent so keep gun in readiness if see head appear miss enemy now kept up constant fire through loophole at end back of house a be shoulder high there be altering elevation of gun shot flew harmlessly over head of defender several time dick went to one other of loophole pistol in hand standing close beside waited until shot be fired then thrusting barrel into loophole fired before gun must be inserted discharge being generally followed by sharp cry of pain after have gone on for nearly hour assailant evidently became discouraged shot came from loophole le frequently presently ceased altogether must give good deal to know what be up to dick said after long pause will look through loophole surajah asked certainly not there will be man standing at of waiting in expectation of taking look out there be none in front surajah said be more than can say have not be firing on side may have men there now will leave well alone surajah longer delay better for keep eye on top of wall a well a on window may have made ladder by time may intend to try shot perhaps be gone surajah suggested be quite possible must know that troop come up here early a have four mile to walk back to fort several wounded to carry with certainly wo stay much longer if a say have not gone already be indeed well that surajah have not attempted to look out at one of loophole for at time asked question dark figure be standing at looking along barrel of gun in readiness to fire moment light be obscured few minute later dick exclaimed how stupid can easily test whether there be one there surajah taking up piece of thatch pushed suddenly across one of loophole shot followed action went round hut repeated experiment at of have gone said confidently have be outside must certainly have fired directly light be obscured standing short distance back from end window looked out between crossbeam hurrah shouted there go up road be quarter of mile away be not more than half a strong a be when came down be carrying eight ten figure on shoulder on litter door see cavalry surajah said a joined be likely enough that may be in hiding among hut opposite be waiting in hope that may be foolish enough to take for granted that be gone pull down bar of door expect will stay until see troop coming up valley continued to look out from window from have now removed bar hour later dick exclaimed there go up side of valley have doubt see troop that in few minute will hear coming be not long before heard trampling of horse moment later rajah voice exclaimed why what be here be dozen dead body be mysoreans by dress right uncle dick shouted will be out a soon a get bar down have be standing siege did not take long to remove bar rajah men have dismounted a soon a of latter have gone round hut have brought back report that there be five more dead on side a dick companion stepped out rajah exclaimed what be alone yes there be one with uncle do mean to say that two have defended place alone killed sixteen of enemy besides see lying farther up road yes uncle see be pretty strong position have time to block up door window to make loophole to fire through what think of anwar rajah exclaimed to captain of troop nephew rajbullub son have shown brave fighter have not be wonderful captain said exclamation of admiration broke from men standing round tell about dick rajah went on be long story uncle real news be that tippoo with army have left head of western pass have gone to seringapatam be going to march down one of pass side at once provision have be collected for army to consume on march one know yet pas will come down by will not be far from here for be buying up cattle in village at top of ghauts be important indeed dick must ride off without delay first must have look at fortress of yours entered hut soldier crowding in after examined defence at window loophole while dick explained how bar have be arranged to defend door began on other side uncle have fight with four men who came up with there only one of got away left gun behind be lucky for gun pistol be of immense use to must not have held out with only own weapon about twenty of cavalry came up few minute afterwards beat off then sent up to fort for infantry about fifty men came down attacked just at sunrise kept up to within hour ago then infantry marched back knowing of course that troop generally got here about seven horseman stayed here till within few minute of arrival doubt thought that must suppose have gone might venture out let get shot at why must have be veritable battle dick there be good deal of noise uncle though not much danger so long a kept below level of loophole window out of line of door there be chance of being hit must have made strong attack on door rajah said see that two lying next to be killed by sword thrust yes be most critical moment uncle have emptied nearly barrel if must have broken down bar have doubt must have done if have stuck to must have made very short work of now let be going rajah said can tell whole story a go along two of sowars be ordered to give up horse to dick surajah to mount behind comrade then started down valley dick riding between uncle captain while surajah took place with two other officer of troop rode so rapidly that dick story be scarcely concluded by time reached village where troop be quartered well have done marvelously well dick uncle said surajah deserves highest praise too now will write note to british officer with nabob giving news of tippoo movement will send off by two of trooper at once where colonel maxwell force be have idea marched to join general meadow on day came up here in meantime can have wash while breakfast be being cooked have doubt that be ready for be indeed uncle have nothing yesterday few cake made of flour water have have nothing at since right lad will be ready almost a soon a breakfast be after meal be over rajah lit hookah said must go through story again evening dick cut short of detail a told to on road want to understand thoroughly have better turn in now for long sleep must want badly enough lad after work of two last night dick slept until uncle roused at six o'clock dinner will be ready in ten minute be just a well that must get up for two three hour after will be good for sleep till morning will have to look out sharp now keep couple of vedettes always at village a for know may be pas by tippoo be coming down dick got up rather reluctantly be not long in shaking off drowsiness after dinner be able to go through story again with full detail of adventure know what must have done without surajah uncle be capital fellow if ever go up by into mysore to look for father hope that will let take will certainly do dick ever since first heard of plan have quite decided that ought not to go alone daresay must have chosen older man to accompany after what lad have done together think must do better than take of course such affair must demand infinitely greater caution care though not greater courage than have occasion to use on excursion be one thing to enter village to ask few question make purchase two be off again be very different thing to be among people for week perhaps month to live a one of however may hope that war will end in army marching to seringapatam when will recover many of prisoner in tippoo hand say know how many hundred remained in power last time in spite of promise to deliver up maybe something of same sort will occur next time number may be sent away by to hill fortress dotted over country must never be able to obtain news of however must hope for best next morning trooper arrived with letter from english resident at rajah glanced through handed to dick with remark will not get honour deserve dick letter ran dear rajah news must be extremely valuable be correct unfortunately be not so doubtless report brought down by nephew be spread by tippoo for purpose of deceiving possibly may have intended to have come way afterwards changed mind have news just after colonel maxwell effected junction with general meadow near caveripatam be about to ascend ghauts by tapour pas tippoo came down by very route slipped past be marching on to trichinopoly that being case see further utility in remaining with troop in pass think be best that must re assemble at once march here there be chance of tippoo capturing trichinopoly before meadow who be following can come up force on battle so be likely that mysore army may continue march in direction in case fighting man will be of use to defend place until be relieved by general dick uttered exclamation of disgust a laid letter down doe not matter about news turning out wrong said be very bad that general meadow must have allowed tippoo to pas a may do frightful damage to country before can be overtaken never can be overtaken a long a chooses to keep ahead be hampered with baggage train life on plunder of country pass through british army with baggage provision train have more chance of overtaking than have of flying messenger be at once sent off to call in scattered portion of troop be assembled in twenty four hour at once started for arcot where arrived after two day march there learned that tippoo have appeared before trichinopoly after pillaging laying waste sacred island of seringham have marched north day after day news arrived of devastation be committing on march at thiagur however met with serious repulse great number of inhabitant from surrounding country have crowded into town with valuable tippoo expecting rich booty attacked town although fortification be insignificant little garrison be commanded by captain flint officer who have so bravely defended wandiwash in previous war two assault be repulsed with serious loss at trinalee thirty five mile farther north be more successful capturing town putting inhabitant to sword here tippoo changed course marched for pondicherry capturing permacoil by way news that tippoo have changed course to southeast be received with great joy at arcot although confident that capital must be able to resist sudden attack belief have be general that whole territory must be laid waste a have be by hyder hope be now entertained that british army must arrive in time to bar tippoo further progress chapter invasion of mysore for time there be pause in hostility tippoo remained with army near pondicherry carrying on negotiation with french governor arranging for despatch of envoy to france with request that republic must furnish with six thousand french troop while be thus wasting time general meadow be slowly moving with army towards encampment formed at vellout eighteen mile west of madras on th of december messenger arrived with news that lord cornwallis have arrived from calcutta two day before with considerable reinforcement that be about to assume supreme command of army news caused unbounded satisfaction by extreme dilatoriness of movement especially by manner in have allowed tippoo to pas near caveripatam when might easily have attacked while army be still struggling through pas general meadow have disgusted troop have frittered away without striking single blow finest army that british have up to time ever put into field in india have enabled tippoo unmolested to spread destruction over large extent of country only countervailing success have be gained by british be brilliant victory won by colonel hartley who be in command of bombay force consisting of european regiment two battalion of sepoys with engaged hossein ali who have be left by tippoo in malabar with force of men when sultan first retreated before general meadow advance force be defeated with loss of men killed wounded including hossein taken prisoner on field in pursuit total british loss being only men few day after victory general abercrombie arrived from madras with reinforcement whole of tippoo fortified place in malabar be captured one after entire province conquered a soon a lord cornwallis reached camp at vellout with large train of draught animal have be brought by sea from calcutta rajah troop received order to join be on th of january that commander in chief arrived at vellout rajah arrived there on th of february a be bearer of letter from resident at arcot be at once enabled to have interview with lord cornwallis on finding that must speak english general received with much courtesy be glad indeed to have troop like yours with rajah said there be few of officer who know anything of part of country local knowledge will be invaluable moreover a speak language myself will be great advantage to have someone with through whom can communicate freely with people of country there be doubt that such communication be much more effectual when come through one of own prince than through english officer will therefore order that on march space be allotted for encampment of troop by side of occupied by own escort hope that when not employed on scouting other duty will ride with staff mother rajah be english lady be told be sir sister who married englishman be at present in madras with family son be with beg to recommend to lordship speaks language perfectly having be brought up in father country

when tell that two young fellow held ruined hut for hour against attack of seventy of tippoo troop beat off with loss of upwards of twenty killed need hardly say that have lack of courage be right indeed rajah let lad ride beside with staff day will perhaps shorten long day march by giving detail of adventure of on th of february army started on march on th reached vellore tippoo have for two month be wasting time at pondicherry upon hearing news that instead of a expected english general having marched south from vellout to meet have turned westward that mysore be threatened with invasion hastily broke up camp marched at full speed for ghauts reaching table land hurried to oppose british army a endeavoured to ascend pas going from vellore through amboor by made sure must come lord cornwallis encouraged in idea by sending battalion considerable distance up pas while started north entered easy pas of mooglee leading west from chittoor to moolwagle pushed rapidly up pas gained summit before tippoo must reach spot oppose took four day longer for battering train baggage provision to reach top of pas after delay of day two to rest animal included sixty seven elephant have be

various division brigade brought up news of progress of train rode on ahead with officer of quartermaster department whose duty be to precede army to decide on camping ground to mark off spot to be occupied by various corp in way saved regular cavalry from much fatiguing duty surajah dick be generally with party went on with quartermaster a soon a camping ground be fixed upon aided in purchase of forage food from native a be most desirable that forty day provision army carried with must remain intact until army have passed up ghauts beyond that be expected that must be harassed by mysore horse who must render impossible for cavalry to go out to collect forage provision from country through marched so well did rajah troop perform duty that lord cornwallis ordered to be taken on strength of army to receive pay ration of native cavalry in service on day after leaving vellore general sent orderly to request rajah nephew to ride with have not have opportunity of hearing of

appoint one of interpreter to army during expedition will attach to own staff will give recognised position be only right that a be doing good service must receive pay will be put in order evening can of course continue to camp live with rajah change made very little difference in dick duty continued at former work in quartermaster department until army be ready for advance to bangalore to general surprise a army moved forward nothing be seen of tippoo cavalry by have expected to be continually harassed sultan have a soon a perceived that bangalore be threatened hurried whole army to city where have sent harem when started from seringapatam to attack travancore instead of sending off few hundred horseman to escort to capital while with army opposed advance of british took whole force with in order to remove harem with pomp ceremony with passage through country be generally accompanied consequently be not until after taking without resistance fort of colar ooscotah arriving within ten mile of bangalore that army encountered tippoo cavalry be on th of march made attempt to reach baggage train be sharply repulsed on following day army took up position before bangalore a approached town three horseman dashed out from small grove rode furiously towards little group consisting of lord cornwallis general meadow staff who be reconnoitring at little distance from head of column be evident that intention be to cut down general rajah who be riding a usual with staff dashed forward with four five other officer encountered horseman before must reach rajah cut down one of be killed by one of staff third knocked off horse captured be learned that enterprise be not planned one be result of quarrel between men one have charged others with cowardice in return have challenged to follow where dared go have prepared for enterprise by half intoxicating with bhang thus made poor fight when found object thwarted by officer who threw between intended victim bangalore be fine town situated on plain so elevated that climate be temperate soil fertile vegetation abundant town be of considerable extent that portion lying within fortification being mile quarter long by mile broad be surrounded by strong rampart thick hedge deep dry ditch wall however did not extend across side facing fort whose gun be supposed to render ample protection fort be oval in shape about nine hundred yard across at greatest diameter be defended by broad rampart strengthened by thirty semicircular bastion five outwork two gate one at end be also protected by outwork in fort stood splendid palace built by tippoo here also be immense foundry of cannon factory for musket arsenal large magazine of grain ammunition position taken up by army lay to northeast of petah town next morning reconnoitring party escorted by colonel floyd with whole of cavalry brigade of infantry went out to examine defence of town fort seeing large body of laden elephant camel escorted by strong body of horseman colonel floyd rode with cavalry to attack movement be rash one a gun on fort opened fire although at first defeated mysore horse heavy fire be poured upon when entangled in broken ground be shot by musket ball striking in face passed through jaw be at first believed that be dead be carried back to camp ultimately recovered rash attack cost life of seventy one men of four time a many horse a tippoo army be lying at distance of only six mile away general determined that must be best in first place to capture town without delay to assault fort on side a must then do so without fear of attack by tippoo who must be able to harass constantly be to approach fort from other direction order be therefore issued for th regiment supported by th bengal sepoys party of artillery under colonel moorhouse to prepare to storm north gate of town at daybreak next morning a soon a dawn broke troop rushed forward against gate outside work be speedily stormed a issued from towards gate be received with very heavy fire from wall together with storm of hand grenade colonel moorhouse brought forward six pounder receiving two wound a piece be run up to gate first time be fired have effect beyond making small hole next shot have greater success colonel moorhouse ordered twelve pounder to be brought up a be aiding to put into position ball struck fell dead while artilleryman be pouring shot after shot into gate roar of musketry be unceasing th keeping up incessant fire upon enemy upon wall in order to cover a much a possible operation of gunner at last gate gave way troop poured in cheering loudly enemy at once fled many however took up position in house kept up galling fire until place of refuge be stormed by detachment of troop scattered through town by nine o'clock be over town completely in possession of british tippoo furious at having be so speedily captured moved down early in afternoon with strong force of infantry marching along by side of fort endeavoured to force way into town through open space at end be aided by gun of fort while artillery kept up heavy cannonade upon british encampment when sultan be seen marching towards town with evident intention of endeavouring to retake th regiment be sent in to reinforce garrison three battalion opposed so steady resistance to tippoo infantry that latter be forced to fall back after sustaining loss of five hundred men troop began next morning to erect battery position be singular one small army be undertaking siege of strong fortress while army vastly outnumbering be watching be able at moment to throw large reinforcement into fort through mysore gate be at opposite end of fort to attacked effort of british being directed against delhi gate faced town advantage have be gained by employment of great train carrying provision for troop be now manifest for unless army have be so provided must have be forced to retreat a in face of tippoo army with great host of cavalry must have be impossible to gather provision first battery erected by engineer proved to be too far distant from wall of fort to effect material damage others be commenced at much shorter range work be performed with great difficulty for gun of defender be well served storm of missile be poured night day into town against battery garrison consisted of eight thousand men be frequently relieved by fresh troop from sultan army be thus able to maintain fire with great vigour on th tippoo cannonaded british camp from distance without doing great damage in meantime fire of siege gun be steadily doing work in spite of heavy fire kept up on stone facing of bastion next to gateway be soon knocked away earth bank behind be very thick constructed of tough red clay crumbled slowly still breach be day by day becoming more practicable tippoo alarmed at progress have be made moved army down towards east side of fort seemed to meditate attack upon battery placed heavy gun behind bank surrounding large tank opened embrasure through fire must have taken trench be now pushed up close to fort in flank lord cornwallis at once directed strong force to advance a if with intention of attacking new work tippoo ordered troop to retire from be evident however that have determined to give battle in order to save fort english general therefore determined to storm place very night st of march preparation be made secretly lest news must be taken to tippoo by one of native in town be not until late in evening that order be issued to troop be to take part in assault column be to be composed of grenadier light company of european regiment be to be followed supported by several battalion of force commanded by colonel maxwell at eleven o'clock issued from town advanced through trench besieged be vigilant instant leading company sprang from trench in bright moonlight ran forward to breach number of blue light be lighted all along rampart heavy musketry fire be opened scene be eagerly watched by troop in camp feature being distinctly visible storming party must be seen rushing up breach mounting by ladder over gateway be central object of attack enemy gathered in mass at top of breach a soon a stormers collected in sufficient strength charged with bayonet broke dispersed grenadier moved along rampart to right clearing of defence a went along light company did same along rampart to left while sepoys descended into body of fort whole of defender fled towards mysore gate at other end of fort when three body of troop met there found gate blocked by mass of fugitive charged on side governor brave old soldier great favourite of sultan died fighting gallantly to last six hundred of garrison fell three hundred for most part wounded be taken prisoner british loss be only fifty officer men killed wounded body of governor be found next morning among slain lord cornwallis sent message to tippoo with offer to have body carried to camp for burial tippoo however replied that proper place for soldier to be buried be where fell accordingly brave old soldier be laid to rest in fort by mohammedan troop in sepoy regiment with military honour while assault be going on tippoo who in spite of precaution taken have received news of intention of general have warned garrison of fort to be prepared despatched two heavy column a soon a fire opened to attack british camp on flank movement have be foreseen prepared against attack be repulsed with heavy loss capture of fort be effected just in time for provision be almost entirely consumed scanty ration be eked out by digging up root of grass vegetable within circuit of picket draught carriage cattle be dying daily by hundred few remaining intended for food be in so emaciated state that flesh be scarcely eatable worst of supply of ammunition be almost exhausted news of fall of fortress considered by native to be almost impregnable under very eye of sultan great army produced widespread effect greatly depressing spirit of tippoo adherent while proportionately raised of british troop excited hope of people conquered by tippoo father one result be that polagars chief of tribe have recently fallen under yoke of mysore be at once emboldened to bring in provision to town a great store be found in magazine in fort starving animal regained of condition during ten day that troop be occupied in repairing breach burying dead placing fort in condition to stand siege must tippoo return during absence of army when be done store of ammunition replenished from magazine army started on march north to deonhully where be to effect junction with cavalry that nizam have agreed to furnish a marched passed within three mile of tippoo army be proceeding in westerly direction tippoo must here have brought on general engagement have wished capture of bangalore have for time cowed spirit continued march at rate soon placed beyond reach of british at deonhully junction be effected with nizam horse ten thousand in number proved however of real utility being mere undisciplined herd who displayed energy except in plundering villager united force now moved southeast to guard great convoy be advancing up pas of amboor when have be met returned to bangalore during operation of siege rajah troop have remained inactive dick duty a interpreter have be nominal at bangalore english prisoner have be found be heartily glad when heard that be intention of lord cornwallis to march directly upon seringapatam be indeed necessity for english general to bring campaign to speedy termination war be entailing tremendous strain upon resource of company nizam mahratti be not to be depended upon in slightest degree might at moment change side french revolution have broken out europe be alarmed many of english regiment might at moment be ordered to return home therefore anything like thorough conquest of mysore be impossible there be only time to march to seringapatam to capture tippoo capital to dictate term to immense exertion be made to restore efficiency of baggage train on rd of may army marched from bangalore tippoo devoured alike by rage fear have taken no efficient step to meet coming storm first thought be to prevent english from discovering brutal cruelty with white captive have be treated have over over again given most solemn assurance that have white prisoner in hand now endeavoured to prevent obtaining evidence of falsehood cruelty by murdering whole of who remained in hand at seringapatam having effected massacre next ordered picture that have caused to be painted on wall of palace other building holding up english to contempt hatred of subject to be obliterated also ordered bridge over northern loop of cauvery to be destroyed then set out with army to bar passage of british to seringapatam weather be extremely bad when british started rain storm have deluged country rendered road well nigh impassable movement be in consequence very slow tippoo have taken up strong position on direct road in order to avoid lord cornwallis took more circuitous route tippoo be obliged to fall back whole country through english passed have be wasted village be deserted not inhabitant be to be met with suffering much from wet immense difficulty of bringing on transport army on th of may arrived on cauvery nine mile east of seringapatam here have be intended to cross river rain have so swollen stream that be found impossible to ford be therefore determined to march to point on river ten mile above seringapatam where be hoped that better ford must be found where junction might be effected with general abercrombie bombay army be moving up from malabar coast be thirty forty mile distant to effect movement be necessary to pas within sight of capital tippoo came out took up strong position on rugged almost inaccessible height in front be swamp stretching to river while battery have be thrown up to sweep approach by night march accomplished in midst of tremendous thunder rain storm lord cornwallis turned tippoo position confusion occasioned by storm however fact that several of corp lost way prevented full success hoped for from being attained gave tippoo time to take up fresh position colonel maxwell led five battalion up rocky ledge held by strong body of mysore troop carried at point of bayonet captured gun tippoo immediately began to fall back must have lost greater portion of artillery have not nizam horse moved forward across line by british be advancing here remained in inert mass powerless to follow tippoo complete barrier to british advance so unaccountable be conduct that be generally believed in army that be result of treachery be with difficulty that british troop must be restrained from firing into horde of horseman who have from time joined force be worse than useless a soon a british must make way through round obstacle to advance pursued retreating force of tippoo until took refuge under gun of work round seringapatam loss have be that of british success be of little benefit to latter terrible state of road want of food have caused death of great number of draught animal rest be so debilitated a to be absolutely useless during two day march be required to reach point on river previously determined upon battering train almost whole of cart be dragged along by troop position of army be bad in extreme food forage be to be obtained from country round troop be almost on famine ration worn out by fatigue by march through heavy rain night spent on sodden ground tippoo horseman hovered round cavalry of nizam have be specially engaged to keep foe at distance never once ventured to engage be absolutely impossible to communicate with general abercrombie after remaining couple of day in new camp lord cornwallis felt that army must only be saved from destruction by immediate retreat time be lost in carrying out decision when once arrived at native be paid heavily to endeavour to make way to abercrombie with order for to retire down ghauts again into malabar then whole of battering train heavy equipment be destroyed on th of may army started for long march back to bangalore have made six mile when body of horseman two thousand strong be seen approaching preparation be instantly made to repel attack when soldier rode in announced that horseman be advance party of two mahratta army close at hand be welcome news indeed for lord cornwallis have idea that mahratti be within two hundred mile of have come to believe that have intention whatever of carrying out engagement have appeared sent off messenger day to inform of movement so vigilant be tippoo cavalry that not one of ever reached british in few hour junction be completed suffering of army be at end store of kind be abundant with mahratti not only food clothing necessary of life must be purchased in great bazaar occupied by mahratta trader who accompanied army have two mahratta army arrived couple of day earlier destruction of siege train must have be avoided seringapatam must have be besieged abercrombie army of eight thousand men have joined war brought at once to conclusion be now however too late mean for prosecuting siege of so powerful fortress be altogether wanting united army returned by easy march to bangalore on march future plan of operation be decided upon lord cornwallis sent order for sum of rupee have be intended for china to be at once despatched to bangalore for use of army ally larger of mahratta force under purseram bhow with detachment of bombay troop have accompanied be to march to northwest reduce of fort town still held by troop of mysore other mahratta force consisting chiefly of cavalry under hurry punt be to remain at bangalore cause of long delay on part of nizam mahratti be now explained nizam troop have spent six month in siege of fortress of capool while equal time have be occupied by purseram bhow in siege of durwar very strong place garrisoned by ten thousand men tippoo began negotiation immediately after defeat near seringapatam be continued until july when be finally broken off month be occupied in reducing number of hill fort commanding entrance to various pass among two deemed absolutely impregnable savandroog nundidroog be captured attack upon kistnagherry be repulsed with considerable loss by capture of place lord cornwallis obtained access to supply from malabar carnatic coast be thus free from risk of recurrence of misfortune have marred previous attempt to lay siege to seringapatam on th of february again came within sight of tippoo capital chapter news of captive during nine month have elapsed since retreat from before seringapatam dick have be occupied in following out main object of presence in mysore finding purseram bhow army be first must be engaged in active service asked permission from general to join be at once granted lord cornwallis introduced to officer in command of bombay troop attached to army informing of object that have in view will not be of much use a interpreter said for a country in be going to operate formed until lately part of mahratta dominion mahratti will be principally spoken will therefore go simply a officer of staff attached for present to command have asked to allow to take with twenty men belonging to troop of uncle rajah of tripataly object in doing so be that will be able to traverse country independently can either rejoin here go to one of other column operating against hill fort if must seem to expedient to do so must desire to make reconnaissance at time while be with will find useful a escort will not be obliged to ask purseram bhow for party of cavalry dick be sorry to leave uncle whose tent have now shared for last ten month found however very comfortable with bombay troop being made member of mess consisting of officer in command four officer of staff wishing to have duty with to occupy volunteered to act a aide de camp although work be little more than nominal gave employment when not otherwise engaged generally rode with surajah whom uncle have appointed to command twenty trooper in year have elapsed since arrival in india dick have grown considerably broadened out greatly be now powerful young fellow of over seventeen have since troop joined army of lord cornwallis exchanged civilian dress for undress uniform of officer have purchased at sale of effect of young lieutenant on general staff who have died just a army arrived before bangalore be indeed necessary that must do riding about a did either on staff of general with officer of quartermaster department there must be difficulty in renewing uniform for hardship fever war have carried off large number of officer a well a men effect be always sold by auction on day following funeral many hill fortress be captured by mahratti few offered resistance a commander knew well that there be chance of being relieved while men be in most case delighted at prospect of escape from enforced service of freedom to return to home in few of fort english captive be found have be there for year very existence being apparently forgotten by tyrant have be fairly treated by mysore governor where be case latter be furnished by british officer with paper testifying to kindness with have treated prisoner recommending to officer of of allied force might encounter on way home when established there upon other hand of prisoner be found to have be starved treated with great brutality in two case where captive said that of companion have died from effect of ill treatment have received governor be tried by court martial shot while of others sentenced to be severely flogged captive released be closely scrutinised by dick eagerly questioned from one of obtained news that father have certainly be alive four year previously for have be in prison together in hill fort near bangalore be civilian sailor said consequently neither of be of use in drilling tippoo battalion have be sent up there father be well then governor be good fellow have nothing much to complain of mr holland be favourite of for being sailor be handy at sort of thing must mend piece of broken furniture repair lock of musket make generally useful left there before did a governor be transferred to other fort never heard where be took father with know whether have tippoo order to do so whether took simply because liked at rate be only prisoner who went with rest of remained there till few month back when fort be abandoned be just after capture of bangalore place must have offered resistance if body of troop have be sent against at rate order arrived one morning few hour afterwards place be entirely abandoned garrison marched here father be quite well quite well used to talk to at time of trying to make escape being sailor have doubt that must have got down from precipice on fort stood knew that if did so must suffer for probably be put to death a soon a tippoo heard that one of have escaped for be always done in order to deter prisoner from trying to get away do think that there be chance of being still alive be more than can possibly say see have not known much of what be passing outside prison of guard be good natured enough must occasionally give scrap of news heard most from ill tempered one who delighted in telling anything knew must pain three four month ago heard that white prisoner in seringapatam have be put to death by tippoo order doubtless there must be similar clearance everywhere else then again be told that english have retreated beaten from before seringapatam that last of must soon be down ghauts whether prisoner have be killed in other hill fort like can not say although suppose not must not have escaped certainly such order can have be sent to fort here for have found few prisoner in several of of course may be otherwise in fort near capital tippoo might have thought be likely to fall into hand while may not have considered worth while to send same order to place so far away a where british force be likely to come still at rate be great satisfaction that father be alive four year ago that be in kind hand be in favour of finding still alive in one of place will take for lord cornwallis intends to besiege of fortress command pass because can not undertake siege of seringapatam until can obtain supply freely regularly from beyond ghauts a nothing can be obtained from country round so completely be wasted by tippoo cavalry have therefore great hope that father may be found in one of fort hope indeed that may find be convinced that governor must save life if must do so though on other hand must be sure carry out order might receive from tippoo of course may not be in charge of fort now may have be appointed colonel of one of regiment however be always better to hope that thing will come a wish however unlikely may seem that will do so have be living on hope here though chance of ever being released be small indeed of course did not even know that tippoo english be at war until heard that english army be besieging bangalore even then felt that even if tippoo be beaten forced to make peace must make difference to kept back hundred of prisoner when be defeated before must certainly not surrender now hold unless compelled to do so one must be able to give information a to existence of captive in distant fort yet in teeth of improbability continued to hope hope have be realised capture of fort by mahratta army be abruptly checked having so far met with such slight opposition purseram bhow became over confident scattered force over wide extent of country in order that might more easily find food forage in condition be suddenly attacked by tippoo who took advantage of english being detained at bangalore while transport train be being reorganised to strike blow at mahratti stroke be heavy one many of detached party be completely destroyed mahratta general after gathering rest to standard be forced to retreat until strong reinforcement be sent from bangalore learning from that be probable lord cornwallis must advance a soon a rejoined dick determined to go back to bangalore a be unlikely that after severe check have received mahratti must resume offensive for time surajah men be glad to return to troop a soon a mysorean force returned to seringapatam dick without waiting for infantry to get in motion rode rapidly across country with little party accompanied english army during operation obtaining permission to go with column engaged in siege of hill fortress be present at capture of most important stronghold to bitter disappointment english prisoner be found in of be too certain that who might have be there have be massacred by tippoo order on first advance of british against seringapatam great indeed be satisfaction of army when at last came in sight of city capital of mysore stood on island in river cauvery be four mile in length two in town stood in centre fort at northern end island be approached by two bridge one close to fort other at south being defended by strong battery there be also three ford two of being at north end of island also defended by battery third be near centre of island mile below fort leading to native town fort be separated from rest of island by deep ditch cut across be defended by numerous battery there be two garden on island full of large tree one of being burial place of hyder ali be connected with fort by two avenue of tree country round be flat considerable portion being almost level with river devoted to cultivation of rice while at other point forest extended almost to bank after obtaining view from high ground of city of tippoo army encamped beyond wall british force took up position six mile to northwest of city sooner have army reached camping ground than lord cornwallis with staff reconnoitred approach thick hedge formed by wide belt of thorny shrub interlaced fastened together by cord extended from bank of river about thousand yard above seringapatam making wide sweep came down to again opposite other end of island be within shelter of formidable obstacle that tippoo army be encamped within enclosed space be seven eight eminence on strong redoubt have be erected fearing that tippoo might a soon a saw position taken up by assailant sally out with army take field a before cut communication lord cornwallis determined to strike blow at once at sunset order be accordingly issued for force to move in three column at three o'clock by time moon must be high enough to light up thoroughly ground to be traversed centre column consisting of men under lord cornwallis be to burst through hedge at centre of enemy position to drive enemy before if possible to cross ford to island with fugitive however be not to be done until centre column be reinforced by under general meadow be to avoid strong redoubt at northwest extremity of hedge entering fence at point between redoubt river drive enemy before until joined centre column colonel meadow have under command left column consisting of men under colonel maxwell be first to carry redoubt on carrygut hill just outside fence having captured to cut way through hedge to cross river at once with portion of centre column unfortunately owing to misunderstanding a to order officer guiding general meadow column instead of taking to point between northwestern redoubt river led directly at fort be stoutly defended cost british eighty men eleven officer leaving strong garrison here column advanced came upon redoubt of even greater strength magnitude general fearing that delay must take place in capturing must entirely disarrange plan of attack thought have better make way out through hedge march round to point where centre column have entered so give lord cornwallis support must need opposed a be to whole army of tippoo in meantime colonel maxwell force have stormed work on carrygut hill have made way through hedge suffering heavily a did so from fire of strong body of enemy concealed in water course head of centre column under general knox after cutting way through hedge pushed on with levelled bayonet thrust way through enemy infantry mingling with mass of fugitive crossed main ford close under gun of fort took possession of village half way between town fort unfortunately in confusion three company have followed rest of regiment three company of sepoys crossed lower down gained possession of palace on bank of river officer in command however not knowing that others have crossed receiving order waited until day began to break then recrossed river joined lord cornwallis portion of whose column having be reinforced by maxwell column crossed river nearly opposite town a be crossing battery of enemy artillery opened heavy fire upon colonel knox with three company charged in rear drove out defender silenced gun time lord cornwallis be with reserve of central column eagerly waiting arrival of general meadow division in unaccountable way have missed gap in hedge by centre column have entered marching on halted at last at carrygut hill where be not discovered until daylight mysore army on left be still unbroken have be joined by large number of troop from centre on discovering smallness of force under lord cornwallis attacked in overwhelming number led by tippoo british infantry advanced to meet with bayonet drove back with heavy loss rallied returned to attack again again be a often repulsed continuing attack however until daylight when lord cornwallis discovering at last position of general meadow joined on carrygut hill when day broke commander of two army be able to estimate result of night operation on english side only position gained be work on carrygut hill redoubt at northwest corner of hedge redoubt captured by centre column position occupied by force under colonel stuart knox at eastern end of island sultan found that army be much reduced in strength no le than twenty three thousand men being killed wounded missing of missing be vastly most numerous for ten thousand chelahs young hindoo whom tippoo have carried off in raid forced to become soldier nominally mohammedan have taken advantage of confusion marched away with arm to forest of coorg tippoo made several determined effort to drive colonel stuart force off island to recapture redoubt be repulsed with such heavy loss that abandoned attempt altogether evacuated other redoubt brought whole army across on to island tippoo now attempted to negotiate have already done so month before lord cornwallis have refused to accept advance saying that negotiation be useless with one who disregarded treaty violated article of capitulation send hither wrote garrison of coimbatoor then will listen to what have to say lord cornwallis alluded to small body of troop who under lieutenant chalmers nash have bravely defended that town when have be attacked by one of tippoo general gallant little garrison have surrendered at last on condition that must be allowed to march freely away condition have be violated by tippoo garrison have be marched a prisoner to seringapatam two officer have be kept in fort most of soldier twenty seven other european captive who have lately be brought in from hill fort be lodged in village colonel knox have first occupied on crossing river have be released by of have be in tippoo hand for many year joy at unexpected release be unspeakable preparation be now made for siege general abercrombie be ordered up with force of six thousand men before arrival lieutenant chalmers be sent in with letter from tippoo asking for term of capitulation negotiation be indeed entered into doubting tippoo good faith preparation for siege be continued upon arrival of general abercrombie force on th of february siege operation be commenced at end of island still in british possession few day afterwards army be astounded at hearing that condition have be agreed upon that hostility be to cease at once so great be indignation indeed that spirit of insubordination almost mutiny be evinced by many of corp have suffered extreme hardship have be engaged in most arduous march have be decimated by fever bad food must scarce believe ear when heard that be to hold hand now that after year campaigning seringapatam be at mercy that man who have butchered so many hundred english captive who have wasted whole province carried million people into captivity who have be guilty of grossest treachery whose word be absolutely worthless be to escape personal punishment still higher did indignation rise among officer men when condition of treaty became known be discovered that stipulation have be made for handing over of english prisoner still in mysore previous to cessation of hostility condition at least must have be insisted upon carried out previous to negotiation being entered upon reason induced lord cornwallis to make treaty when seringapatam lay at mercy have ever be mystery tippoo have proved monster unfitted to live much le to rule crime have committed against english must have be punished by public trial execution of author to conclude peace with now be to enable to make fresh preparation for war to necessitate expedition at enormous cost great loss of life tippoo have already proved that be not to be bound either by treaty oath lastly must have be thought that a general lord cornwallis must have wished name to go down to posterity in connection with conquest of mysore capture of seringapatam rather than with memorable surrender of york town greatest disaster ever befell british army condition be in onerous have be imposed upon other than brutal faithless tyrant might have be deemed sufficient tippoo be deprived of dominion be to be divided among ally taking portion adjacent to territory sum of pound be to be paid for expense of war prisoner of allied power be to be restored two of tippoo son be to be given up a hostage even after have be handed over there be considerable delay before tippoo signature be obtained be not until lord cornwallis threatened to resume hostility on th of march treaty be finally sealed of ceded territory mahratti nizam took third a share although assistance have rendered in struggle have be of comparatively slight utility may indeed be almost said that be given to a reward for not accepting offer tippoo have made of joining with against british british share included large part of malabar coast with fort of calicut cananore territory of ally rajah of coorg cession gave pass leading into mysore from west on south gained possession of fort of dindegul district surrounding while on east acquired tract from amboor to caroor so obtained possession of several important fortress together with chief pass by hyder have made incursion into carnatic dick felt deeply absence of proviso in treaty that prisoner must be restored previous to cessation of hostility at same time admitting argument of uncle that although under such agreement prisoner might be released there be mean of insuring that stipulation must be faithfully carried out see dick one know have indeed faintest idea what prisoner tippoo still have in hand know how many have be murdered during year have reigned men who have escaped have from time to time brought down news of murder in place where have be confined have known little of what have happened elsewhere moreover have learned that certainly fifty sixty be put to death at seringapatam before advanced upon first time know too that be murdered in hill fort that have captured how many remain alive at present time have not slightest idea tippoo might hand over dozen take solemn oath that there be not one remaining though might feel perfectly certain that be lying must be in position to prove stipulation ought to have be made if only a matter of honour must have be of real efficiency of course if have dethroned tippoo annexed territory must undoubtedly have got at prisoner wherever be hidden must hardly have done that must have aroused jealousy fear of native prince in india must have united nizam mahratti against must even have be disapproved of in england where public opinion be adverse to further acquisition of territory where people be of course altogether ignorant of monstrous cruelty perpetrated by tippoo not only upon english captive upon neighbour everywhere naturally be prejudiced in favour of treaty for handing over of country from amboor to caroor with pass fort will set free at tripataly from danger of being again overrun devastated by mysore people will be able to go about work peacefully in security free alike from fear of wholesale invasion incursion of robber band from ghauts waste land will be taken up revenue will be trebled there be thing now that english posse territory beyond of nabob of arcot be gradually spreading power north there can be little doubt that before long whole country of arcot travancore tanjore other small native power will be incorporated in dominion arcot be powerless for defence while during last two war have be nominally ally of english nabob have be able to give real assistance burden of territory have fallen on took first step when at beginning of present war arranged with to utilise resource collect revenue of possession to allow annual income for maintenance of state family be clearly first step towards taking territory into own hand managing revenue same will be done in other case lord cornwallis other day in thanking for service that troop have rendered promised that early arrangement must be made by must rule tripataly under government of madras instead of under nabob see will be virtually step in rank will hold land direct from english instead of from prince who have become in fact puppet in hand few day later army set off on march from mysore same day rajah after making adieu to lord cornwallis started with troop for tripataly making way by long march instead of following slow progress of army after couple of day at tripataly went down to madras brought back rajah household meeting between dick mother be one of mixed feeling be twenty month since former have left with uncle be now nearly eighteen have written whenever there be opportunity of sending letter although position a interpreter on staff of general have relieved from great anxiety on account be glad indeed to see again upon other hand fact that a war went on fortress after fortress have be captured news came to that hope have be realised that war have now come to termination without mystery that hung over husband being in way cleared up have profoundly depressed mr holland be with mingled tear of pleasure sorrow that fell on neck on return to madras must not give way mother dick said a sobbed out fear that hope be at end remember that have never doubted be alive that have always said must know if evil fate have befallen have always felt confident that be right there be nothing changed certainly have not succeeded in finding have found many prisoner in of little out of way fort now of have be captive quite a long a have therefore there be reason why must not also be alive have thought of giving up search a hopeless mean to carry out old plan certainly be much better fitted to do so than be when first landed here know great deal about mysore although say speak dialect like native have learnt good deal of can speak quite a well a native of ghauts outlying province surajah who be great friend of mine have told that if go will go too will be tremendous help anyhow a long a continue to believe firmly that father be still alive mean to continue search for do believe that be alive dick a firmly a ever have not lost hope in respect be only that doubt now whether will ever be found well be business mother a long a continue to believe that be still alive will continue to search for have other object in life at present will be quite soon enough for to think of taking up commission have be promised when tell that feeling that be alive have be shaken mr holland be comforted by dick assurance confident tone putting thought aside for time gave up to pleasure of return have found everything at tripataly a have left for mysore horseman have not penetrated so far north before tippoo turned course east to pondicherry people have month before returned to home avocation one evening rajah said a be sitting together hear from wife dick that mother have told still intend to carry out original project yes uncle have quite made up mind a to that there be still plenty of place where may be certainly be good deal more fitted for travelling about in disguise in mysore than be before rajah nodded yes think dick be a capable of taking care of a anyone must be hear that surajah be willing to go with will certainly be great advantage have proved thoroughly intelligent trustworthy have promised someday will be captain of troop be not thinking of starting just yet suppose uncle thought of staying month two before go off again mother say can not let go before fancy will take longer than dick before can pas a native dick looked surprised why uncle did pas a native eighteen month ago yes did dick for how long went into shop bought thing chatted for short time with native so on be not like living among must be found out before have be single day in company of native dick looked still more surprised how uncle what do do that must know by be not what do dick be what do ca sit on heel squat a call be habitual attitude of native squat while cook squat for hour by fire smoking talking never stand for length of time except upon divan something of sort never sits down before can go live among native pas a one for length of time must learn to squat a do for hour at stretch can tell that be not by mean easy accomplishment to learn have quite lost power used to be able to do a boy from always sitting on divan chair in european fashion have got out of way of think must squat for quarter of hour to save life dick mother cousin laughed heartily said seriously be quite right uncle wonder never thought of before be stupid of not to do so of course when have be talking with surajah other officer by camp fire have sat on ground see that must never do in native dress will begin at once wait moment dick rajah said there be other thing will have to practise may have to move in several disguise must learn to comport in accordance with must remember that motion be quicker more energetic than be of people here walk be different swing of arm carriage be different from theirs be unaccustomed to walk either barefooted in native shoe now thing have to be practised before can really pas muster therefore propose that will at once accustom to attire can do in apartment of evening ranee boy will be able to correct first awkwardness to teach much after week two must stain face arm leg go out with rajbullub in evening must keep eye open watch everything pass do a see others do when rajbullub think that can pas muster will take to going out with in daylight so will come in time to reach point that will be safe for to begin attempt watch only peasant there be saying that may not be necessary to take to other disguise observe trader soldier even fakir will see that walk with different mien trader be slow sober man who wear sword walk with certain swagger fakir be everything by turn whine threatens sometimes mumble prayer sometimes shriek at top of voice when be not riding shooting lad spend time in garden with woman go into town keep eye open bear in mind that be learning lesson that life depends upon being perfect in respect a to first disguise will speak to rajbullub will get ready by tomorrow evening dress of peasant of mysore differs little from that here save that wear rather more clothing than be necessary in warm climate chapter in disguise on following evening dick appeared in room where others be sitting in dress rajbullub have got for be similar to of other peasant boy have already be told that be shortly going on journey that must be necessary for to travel in disguise have be warned that be matter be not to be spoken of to anyone early respect that dick strength activity have inspired with have be much shaken when discovered that be unable either to ride shoot father narrative of adventure when scouting with surajah have completely reinstated in high opinion when entered however burst out laughing two lady must not help smiling dick be not long before joined in laugh against have felt uncomfortable enough when started in almost similar dress with surajah although there be then one to criticise appearance now in presence of mother aunt felt strangely uncomfortable never mind dick uncle said encouragingly boy must feel just a uncomfortable a do now if be dressed up in european fashion now while be talking make first attempt at sitting on heel dick squatted down until knee nearly touched chest moment later lost balance toppled over amid roar of laughter next time balanced more carefully be right dick will get accustomed to in time must see already that there be good deal more to be done than thought of before can pas a native remember must not only be able to balance while sitting still must be able to use hand for cooking purpose for example for eating for doing anything there may be to only without losing balance without showing that be balancing be much more difficult than thought uncle of course have always seen native squatting like seemed so natural that never struck be difficult at say be beginning to hurt already shin bone be aching horribly yes be where strain come boy have got to stick to until muscle there have never be called into play in way before get accustomed to work understand uncle be just same with arm when began to climb ca stand longer can no more get up than can fly dick rolled over on to side again again tried after short rest between trial a gave up limped stiffly to divan said feel a if one have be kicking on shin until have nearly broken mother have be kicked pretty badly several time in fight by rough fellow at home in shadwell never hurt like rubbed aching leg ruefully well uncle be very much obliged to for putting up to practising position seemed to that must be quite simple thing to walk along quietly to move arm about a do never thought of wonder mother never told that above thing must have to learn to squat on heel for time must not have be so difficult to learn five six year ago when be not anything like so heavy a be now never once occurred to dick wish have thought have foreseen difficulty never once came into mind that in order to pas a native must be able to sit like one ah well will learn in time mother dick replied cheerfully exercise be hard at first one soon get accustomed to dick threw with usual energy into new work although of morning when first woke shin caused most acute pain always spent hour in practice afterwards must sit for time allowing water from tap at side of bath to flow upon aching muscle then must dress a soon a breakfast be over go for run in garden at first be shamble gradually terrible stiffness must wear off must return to house comparatively well of evening practice be longer be kept up until aching pain became unendurable at end of four five day be scarcely able to walk at after time matter improved three week later must preserve attitude for hour at time in other respect training have gone on uninterruptedly day went out into town accompanied sometimes by rajbullub sometimes by surajah in disguise of peasant soldier trader learnt to walk carry in accordance with dress before putting on disguise painted with solution must easily be washed off on return to palace where now always wore european dress can not be too careful rajah said there be of course mohammedan here for aught know may act a agent spy of tippoo just a english have agent spy in mysore be one of to send word that have taken to indian attire that be believed that be about to undertake mission other must add considerably to difficulty danger a be one outside own circle ever see about with boy except in european dress rajbullub tell that in single instance while have be in disguise have suspicion be excited question asked by people of various class with whom converse in street month passed by time dick must without great fatigue squat on heel for hour at time a date for departure drew near mother became more more nervous anxious will never forgive if come back said one day when be alone can not feel have be selfish really on strength of conviction most people must laugh at a whimsical absurd be risking substance for shadow be imperilling life of only boy upon faint chance that may find husband know that even uncle although have always be most kind about assisted in way in power have little belief in success of search although a see how bent be upon say nothing might dash hope if evil come of dick will never forgive will feel have sacrificed to sort of hallucination can only say mother dick replied that came out here entered into plan only because have most implicit faith that be right must now continue on own account even if tomorrow must be taken from of course see plainly enough that chance be greatly against ever hearing anything of father from have taken place during campaign have seen that there must be many british captive still hidden away among hill fort be quite possible may be among even say that be probable chance be not so very greatly against even if thought be smaller much smaller than believe to be must still consider duty to go up try find so even if must happen that never come back again will not have to blame for be not be sending who be going of free will indeed feel so much duty that even be to turn round now ask to stay must still think right to undertake mission indeed mother see no great danger in in fact scarcely danger at at rate unless find father if do so there might certainly be risk in attempting to get away if be lucky enough in discovering will not weigh with for instant if find seems to that risk be mere nothing surajah will wander about enlisting in garrison of fort then if find there be prisoner there will take early opportunity of getting away in place doubt will be able to learn from men of garrison whether there be prisoner without being forced to enter at for although in great fort like savandroog outradroog be considered so important defence must be kept secret that none of garrison be allowed to leave until be discharged a too old for service there be occasion for same precaution in case of le important place thus see will simply have to wander about keeping eye ear open finding out either from peasant soldier whether there be prisoner there wish must go with dick used to think that when work of searching for father have begun must wait patiently for result instead of find even more anxious more nervous than be at shadwell can quite understand mother that be very much more trying work sitting here waiting than be to be actively engaged only thing be that must promise not to trouble more than can help for if think of a sitting here fretting about will worry infinitely more than otherwise must over difficulty may have to encounter must remember that will have surajah with be capital companion will always be able to advise upon native business be a plucky a fellow can be can trust to do anything just a must myself preparation for departure now began in earnest there be discussion a to arm be to be taken at last be decided that with safety must carry nothing beyond matchlock pistol sword great pain be taken in selection of matchlock in armoury be several weapon of high finish with silver mounting have belonged to rajah father grandfather be tried against other two be proved to be most accurate be chosen dick found indeed that at distance up to hundred yard be quite equal to english rifle have brought out silver mounting be taken off then piece differed in way in appearance from in general use among peasantry pistol be chosen with equal care sword be of finely tempered steel blade being removed from jewelled handle for be substituted rough handle of ordinary metal ten gold piece be sewn up underneath iron band encircling leathern scabbard a many under boss of shield five piece in sol of of shoe in waist sash ordinary receptacle of money carried small bag with native silver coin at last be ready hour before daybreak dick took cheerful farewell of mother hearty one of uncle with surajah passed through town struck up into hill carried bag slung over shoulder well filled with provision small water bottle hung upon matchlock change of clothing in fold of turban dick have packet of powder used for making dye so that must at time renew brown shade when began to fade out for time few word be spoken dick knew that although mother have borne up bravely till last must break down a soon a left thought that might never see again weighed heavily upon surajah on contrary be filled with elation at prospect of adventure danger be silent simply because felt that for present young lord be in humour for speech a soon a sun rose dick shook off depression be now considerable distance up hillside there be path for people of tripataly have occasion to visit mysore still le desire for visit from mysoreans periodically raid be made upon village plain by marauder from hill be mostly by pass through ghauts thirty forty mile left right from little state nestling at foot of hill for most part escaped visitation now that british have become possessed of territory hill have be hoped finally ceased nevertheless people be always prepared for such visit cultivator have pit in stored harvest except so much a be needed for immediate want pit be lined with mat others be laid over grain two foot of soil be then placed over mat after ground have be ploughed there be indication of existence of hiding place town be surrounded by wall of sufficient strength to withstand attack of party of marauder custom of keeping man on watch tower be still maintained at foot of tower stood heavy gun whose discharge must at once warn peasant for mile round of enemy calling near to hasten to shelter of town while men of village at distance must hurry with wife family to hiding place among hill dick surajah have need of path for be well acquainted with ground have often wandered up nearly to crest of hill in pursuit of game hour before noon took seat under rock shaded from sun ray sitting down partook of hearty meal there be occasion for haste prepared for rest until heat of day be passed be fairly off now surajah dick said a stretched out comfortably have be thinking of almost a long a can remember can hardly believe that have come to pas have thought of short time lord surajah dick interrupted know be arranged that from first be to call purseram for unless get accustomed to will be calling bey lord ' in hearing of others have forgotten surajah replied with smile then went on be short time since be sure be going with have ever hoped that time must come when instead of dull work of drilling men placing on guard might have opportunity of taking part in war adventure indeed have thought of asking lord uncle to permit to go away for while in one of company regiment there to learn business since english have become master there be longer war between rajah rajah a there used to be in olden time be only way that man of spirit can gain distinction adventure be far better for there will be much danger need for caution a well a courage dick nodded more for caution coolness than for courage think surajah will only be in case find father if grave suspicion fall on that there will be need for courage once well into mysore see little chance of suspicion falling upon have agreed that will first make for seringapatam avoiding a much a possible place on way where inquiry whence come may be made of once in city will be safe from such question can travel thence where will will be hard if when there manage to learn place at prisoner there may be be most likely to be kept besides father be a likely to be there a anywhere for tippoo may since army marched away have ordered prisoner to be brought down from hill fort to seringapatam when sun have lost power proceeded on way again start have be timed so that for first week must have moonlight must therefore be able to travel at night until arrived at seringapatam be considered that be only necessary to do for first two three night a after that tale that be coming from village near frontier be on way to join tippoo army must seem natural enough to villager who might question continued course until nearly midnight by time be completely fatigued choosing spot sheltered by bush lay down to sleep took two day before be clear of broken country greater portion of part of journey performed in daylight occasionally saw in distance small fort guarded road to plateau to always gave very wide berth a although according to term of peace must have be evacuated might still be occupied by party of tippoo troop indeed news have arrived since army left represented tippoo a making effort to strengthen army fortress to prepare for renewal of war several time saw bear abounded among ghauts once beheld two tiger crossing nullah have however other matter to think of flesh skin of bear must have be of use to work be severe be glad when at last reached level country in of upper valley opening on to have seen small village near one of have slept a in morning saw that inhabitant be hindoo fearlessly went out talked with in order to gain information a to position of fort to learn whether body of tippoo troop be likely to be met with found people altogether ignorant on matter be simple peasant whole thought be given to tilling land bringing in sufficient to live upon to satisfy demand of tax gatherer when visited have little communication with other village knew nothing of what be passing outside own evinced curiosity whatever concerning visitor who bought from cake of ground ragee formed chief article of food country through passed on emerging from hill be largely covered with bush jungle be very thinly populated be almost unbroken flat save here there isolated mass of rock rose above be extremely steep inaccessible on summit be hill fort that formed so prominent feature in warfare of mysore nizam dominion to north fort be for most part considered absolutely impregnable last war with british have proved that be not so a several of strongest have be captured with comparatively slight loss whenever passed within few mile of one of hill fortress dick looked at with anxious eye for there for aught knew father might be languishing after two day walking across plain felt that there be longer necessity for concealment except that must be a well to avoid encounter with troop although therefore avoided principal road kept along beaten path did not hesitate to enter village to buy food no longer saw caste mark on forehead of inhabitant hindoo have be compelled by force to abandon religion who refused to do so being put to death at once dick surajah found that dialect differed much more from of country below ghauts than have expected although have difficulty in conversing with peasant found that idea that must be able to pas a native of one of village be altogether erroneous one will never do surajah dick said a left one of village will have to alter story somehow for first person meet in seringapatam will see that be not native of mysore must give out that come from village far down on ghauts one of have be handed over to english by new treaty know country well enough there to be able to answer question may be asked must say that desiring to be soldier hating english raj have crossed hill to take service of sort in mysore will be natural enough of course there be many mohammedan down in plain especially among village on ghauts think must be best purseram there be one comfort dick went on be evident that tippoo be hated by hindoo have forced to change religion need have fear of being betrayed by of except from pressure from desire to win tippoo goodwill yes might be case with who be fairly well off must scarcely be so among poorer class besides even be living among must have reason for suspecting story there seems doubt from what say that tippoo be preparing for war again think that will do well a soon a enter city to change attire might be forced into joining army must be last thing want what must desire above thing be to get service of kind in palace after six day travel saw wall of seringapatam dick have made many inquiry at last halting place a to position of ford on side of town learned that only leading to fort be guarded ford opposite town be freely open to traffic must be crossed without question by country people although watch be kept to see that none of very numerous prisoner escaped by be here therefore that crossed river water being little more than knee deep question be asked by guard a passed appearance differing in way from of peasant of neighbourhood after quarter of mile walk entered town be open undefended by wall street be wide laid out at right angle shop however be poor for slightest appearance of wealth sufficed to excite cupidity of tippoo agent possessor must be exposed to exorbitant demand if not complied with must have entailed first torture then death street however presented busy appearance be thronged with soldier battalion of recruit passed along be evident that tippoo be doing in power to raise strength of army to former level wandered about for time at last in small street dick went up to old man whose face pleased be standing at door of house desire to find room where can lodge for time said can direct where can obtain one be not soldier old man asked desire to earn living have not yet decided whether to join army be from plain native said sharply in own dialect be so dick replied yet be mohammedan one be mohammedan here ah because be choice of 'death mohammed how come that two young men must voluntarily leave home to enter tiger den look honest youth how come here trust that be honest dick said have assuredly not ventured here without reason reason be good one be not city where one talk of such matter to stranger in street even though face tell one that can be trusted with secret old man be silent for minute then said come in son can a say trust have room that can occupy followed into house led into small room at back be poorly furnished be scrupulously clean pan of lighted charcoal stood in one corner over pot of rice be boiling bid welcome said gravely a salutation be not one in use by mohammedan dick saw that idea that old man be hindoo who have be forced to abjure religion be correct one old man motioned to to take seat on divan ask for confidence said if choose to give to will be sacred may be poor a be be able to aid will tell at once be native of conjeveram of course hindoo be settled a trader at old capital when four year ago tyrant destroyed that town with over hundred thousand of religion be forced to adopt mohammedanism be of high caste like many others must have preferred death to yielding have not be that have young daughter for sake lived moved here from mysore gained nothing by sin be one of wealthiest trader in whole city have be here month when tippoo soldier burst in one day daughter be carried off to tiger harem be threatened with torture unless divulged hiding place of money be useless to resist wealth be now worthless to without hesitation complied with demand have be seized save one small hoard be enough to keep thus to end of day want be few handful of rice grain day be satisfied must have put end to life be not that according to religion suicide be accursed moreover must fain live to see vengeance must day fall upon tyrant after what have said be for to decide whether think can be trusted with secret for be sure be for slight reason that have come to accursed city dick felt that must safely speak that must find in native very valuable ally therefore told story without concealment except exclamation of surprise broke from lip when dick said that be english old man listened without remark until have finished tale be indeed strange one said when have heard story have looked for something out of ordinary assuredly for nothing so strange a truly english be wonderful people be marvellous that one must come way from beyond black water to seek for father lost so many year ago methinks that blessing will surely alight upon such filial piety that will find father yet alive be not for must deem search useless one thousand of englishman have be massacred during last ten year hundred have died of disease suffering many have be poisoned many officer have also be murdered of here more in hill fort for be there be generally sent when death be determined upon still may live there be men who have be here a many year who yet survive then be where main body of prisoner be kept dick asked yes be brought here native english ten of thousand of boy youth swept up by tippoo army from malabar coast carnatic be brought up here formed into battalion english prisoner be forced to drill be poor drill have seen drilling recruit at conjeveram difference between quick sharp order there listless command here be great indeed consequently englishman be punished by being heavily ironed kept at starvation point for slackness with obeyed tyrant order sometimes be set to sweep street sometimes be beaten till well nigh expired under lash often must have died of hunger be not that tippoo own troop took pity on supplied from store of boy drummer boy ship boy little ship officer be kept in palace trained a singer dancer for tippoo amusement very many of white prisoner be handed over to tippoo by admiral sufferin though how christian must have brought to hand over christian to tiger can not imagine others be captured in foray there be till lately many survivor of force surrendered in hyder time there be certainly in other town for be policy of hyder a be of tippoo always to break up party of prisoner many be sent to bangalore to burrampore very many to fort of chillembroom heard that nearly died of famine disease very quickly while tippoo at time considers strong enough to fight english be said to aim at conquest of southern india have yet fear of englishman thus separate captive lest if be together must plot against bring about rising know that old hindoo population be against that even among mohammedan be very unpopular chelah battalion who numbered twelve fourteen thousand made up entirely of have dragged from home in district devastated by must assuredly have joined against be there prospect of success just a seized opportunity to desert six month ago when english attacked camp across river now if will tell in what way can best serve will do so in first place sturdy young peasant be wanted for army assuredly will not be here many day before will find yourselves in rank whether like not for tippoo be in way particular how get recruit chapter useful friend agree with that must be disadvantage to go a soldier dick said after pause what disguise must recommend to choose must think over look too straight active to be employed a assistant of trader must have got of friend to take in capacity best disguise will be gayer attire such a must be worn by retainer of of chief be not that if questioned must not say who be employer be what must recommend saw number of men working at battery be erecting by river side must not take service there until something better present must not advise that native replied for work be very hard pay poor indeed most of employed on be men driven in from country round forced to labour getting only enough pay to furnish with poorest food there must also be disadvantage that if be so employed must have opportunity of seeing english captive who may have be brought here of late can at present do be to speak to of friend who have be here for long time ask whether can remember english captive being sent up here from coorg eight year ago whether ever heard what be fate must say of course have received message from friend at conjeveram that of man relation have sent out to make inquiry concerning asking if can find news a to fate friend may not know may be able to find out from others very many of people be forced into rank of army there be not regiment have not men who although regarded a mohammedan be still at heart a be a true to faith a ever be from that be more likely to obtain information than in other way will not be very long before will be able to satisfy a to whether not whom seek be in city if must not be here there remain two town have named hill fort a to will be well nigh impossible to obtain entrance so jealously be guarded none save garrison be allowed to enter path be often so steep difficult that men provision have to be slung up in basket be guarded night day none be allowed to approach foot of rock within musket shot lest suppose might find spot where ascent must be made garrison be seldom changed soldier be allowed to take wife family up with once there be a much prisoner a in dungeon be one reason why captive once sent up there never come down again for be to do so might if by chance escaped be able to give information a to approach must assist assailing force say that be killed though undoubtedly most of be put to death soon after arrive may be that be retained in confinement from order being sent for execution from very existence being in time forgotten by tyrant here of may languish in dungeon others may have gained goodwill of commander of fort for even among mohammedan there be doubtless many good merciful men now for present house have one storey in front there be room over be at service furniture have none will evening get couple of truss of straw be loft will not want to use save to sleep in need not fear interruption in house there be scarce man here be not like hindoo for when be brought here from mysore piece of ground on street stand be assigned to be directed to build house here few besides ever enter for who still carry on trade have booth in marketplace there be one thing will tell at once persecuted have mean of recognising other outward sign there be none caste mark peculiarity of dress know other by sign when salute turn in thumb a raise hand to turban so if have occasion to salute a move hand to stroke face to touch handle of dagger in other way keep thumb turned in if man be one of reply in same way then to prevent possibility of error one asks other question on what subject matter not providing that before speaks cough slightly must remember that such communication be not made lightly be to be so must soon attract notice be used when want to know whether can trust man be a much a to say 'be friend can have confidence in will help can see that there be many occasion on such knowledge may be most useful even to saving of life do indeed see dick said greatly be indebted to for telling of remained talking with host whose name be told pertaub until darkness came on have shared rice with have requested to lay in such provision a be necessary for a soon a became dark went out leaving gun behind busy a main street be when have before passed through be very much more so now shop be lighted up by lantern small lamp street be filled with troop now dismissed from duty bent on amusement in purchasing small addition to ration with scanty pay allowed to in open space soldier be crowded round performer of various kind here be juggler throwing ball knife into air there be snake charmer hindoo doubtless too old too poor to be worth persecuting short distance off be acrobat turning twisting into strange posture two sword player with buckler blunted tulwars played occasionally against other offered to engage of bystander occasionally invitation must be accepted sword player always proved too skilful for rough soldier who retired discomfited amid jeer of comrade more than one party of musician played what seemed to dick most discordant music be appreciated by soldier a be evident from plaudit number of small coin thrown to player in great open space by side of market crowd be thickest here be large number of booth gay with lamp in one be arranged on table tray of cheap trinket calico cloth blanket shoe other article of dress in be arm matchlock pistol tulwars dagger on ground be line of basket filled with grain of many kind vendor squatting patiently behind of trader volubly accosted passer by others maintained dignified silence a if considered excellence of ware needed advertisement be not new be very amusing to dick be late before returned to lodging wish said a strolled back that be good juggler musician seems to that must be excellent disguise must go everywhere without question get admittance into sort of place must not get chance of entering into in other way yes must be good thing surajah agreed be sure must not do anything even if must quite see be not thinking of trying must have be first rate plan be very good at sword play surajah suggested although somewhat doubtfully dick laughed first really good swordsman came along must make exhibition of one must have to do something really well subject be renewed after have seated with pertaub must be excellent disguise agreed good juggler must gain admission to palace might even enter fort where others must set foot for life there be dull indeed anyone who must amuse soldier must be certain of welcome even governor might be willing to see feat must one bribe conjurer to let one pas a assistant must be impossible hindoo said for assistant must have opportunity for learning trick money must induce really good juggler to divulge secret have be passed down from father to son for century if one have thought of dick said one must have bought in london very many thing must have seemed almost magical to people here be afraid that must go on on old line be pity for other must have be first rate have obtained for evening two suit of clothes such a spoke of in can pas a follower of petty rajah be not likely to attract attention have inquired among of friend hear that rajah of bohr left here today with following be petty chief bohr lie up north close to nizam frontier thus if must be asked in whose service be will have name to give there will be fear of being contradicted if be still further questioned by anyone with right to ask can say that be told to remain here in order to see how fast drilling of troop went on to send rajah report when be time for to return here to accompany tippoo on march will of course account for dialect by keeping to present story that came from village on ghauts in order to enter service of one of rajah that father having year ago be soldier in pay of rajah of bohr made way there direct instead of coming to capital will do excellently pertaub be fortunate moment indeed brought to door have done nothing a yet sahib hope that in time may be able to be of use to be fortunate for a well a for perhaps that stopped at door of late have have nothing to think of save own grief trouble now have something to give interest to life already feel that need not merely drag on until be relieved of burden now sahib be sure that rest must be needful for must recommend that seek bed at once on following morning pertaub brought up garment that have bought for nothing must be more irregular than dress of armed retainer of indian rajah attire according to fancy carry spear shield others matchlock wear turban others iron cap cut colour of garment be also varied in extreme dick dress consisted of steel cap with drooping plume of red horsehair red tunic with blue sash over

carried off by tippoo in raid on travancore young men be compelled to serve after being obliged to become nominally mohammedan after chelah battalion came of tippoo army fellow look a if must fight dick said be irregular lot seem to have idea of keeping line marching in step be active looking set of fellow carry well a to chelahs must say must be no good whatever even if must be relied on know can not be look dejected miserable suppose hate a much a officer do must back regiment of english to lick twelve battalion wonder tippoo doe not see that troop like must be utterly useless expect think must be of much use surajah agreed only turned into soldier to gratify hatred of leaving troop walked on entered great fort enclosed area of nearly two square mile in be tippoo palace storehouse containing grain sufficient for garrison for siege of many month mosque residence of tippoo official officer arsenal hut for troop there be also street of shop similar to in town wandering about unquestioned came presently upon scene filled dick with indignation fury two white officer heavily ironed be seated on ground similarly ironed lay stretched beside be naked from waist up back be covered with blood have evidently be recently flogged until fell insensible dozen savage looking men evidently executioner of tippoo order be standing round jeering at prisoner refusing entreaty to bring water for comrade brute one of captive exclaimed in english must give hope of liberty for ten minute face to face with with sword in hand must not be of much use to other said quietly be four day since have mouthful of food must make very short work of better other exclaimed death must be thousand fold preferable to misery dick felt that if remained longer must be unable to contain turning hastily away walked off accompanied by surajah be awful exclaimed with tear running down cheek to be able to hing what must father have gone through think surajah that if be to come upon tippoo must go for even if be surrounded by guard of course must cost life if must kill think must not mind villain be not fit to live at rate whoever came after prisoner must not be worse off than be now let go back have have enough for morning when returned dick told pertaub of scene that have witnessed many of have be starved to death old man said possibly one of companion may have tried to escape be to prevent tippoo greatest cruelty be perpetrated be not so very difficult to get away take to jungle have succeeded most of be retaken for watch be vigilantly kept up at village road leading on to frontier if caught be hung forced to take poison whether be caught not tippoo vengeance fall upon companion be flogged ironed kept without ration for week living if do live upon charity of guard be why there be so few attempt at escape man know that whether get off not doom companion to torture perhaps death one case remember in english sailor one out of nine attempted to get away be captured killed at once eight companion be hung so see even if one of captive see chance of escape doe not take because of consequence must fall upon companion be horrible dick said can quite understand why so few escape question for now be whether there be prisoner kept in dungeon here not here think policy be to make captive useful though one might be ironed confined for time think that be so kept permanently here there be of course confined to fort by illness in iron may need little search before be quite sure that have seen one however will try to find out how many there be there to get a many of name a possible of friend who keep shop in fort may be able to do for must shorten task can not hold out hope that will find whom seek in city be among hill fort will find if be alive have be turning matter over since spoke to last night best plan can think of be that must go a travelling merchant with surajah a assistant must want good assortment of good fine muslin silk good selection of silver jewellery from different part of india must purchase for here if by good luck must obtain sight of commander of one of fort might possibly obtain permission from to go up show ware to lady of establishment to of other officer present of handsome waist sash silver mounted dagger might incline favourably to petition think that idea be excellent one dick said warmly if can not get in in way there seems to to be chance save by taking careful survey of fortress to discover where rock can be most easily climbed there must surely be spot even among steepest crag where active fellow like surajah must be able to scale of course must have to do after dark once up there one ought to be able to move about in fort without difficulty a must of course be dressed a soldier must take dark blanket to wrap round ought then to be able to find where prisoner who may be there be confined there might be sentry at door if there be other way one might pounce upon someone force by threat to tell prisoner there be where be confined then bind gag stow away where there must be chance of being discovered before daylight there must be terrible risk in such matter pertaub said shaking head gravely doubt there must be risk came here prepared to encounter danger if be well managed see why must be found out even if be ought to be able to slip away in darkness make way to point where went up once down on plain must renew disguise a trader however hotly scoured country pas without suspicion through think that there will be more chance in way than in going in a trader for must in case have little chance of walking about still le of questioning anyone however be worth trying that first can always fall back upon other if fails might on first visit obtain indication must be very useful to on second chapter tiger in zenana week passed by end of time dick be perfectly assured that father be not at seringapatam be then question of hill fort to try first pertaub have already procured for assortment of good dress suitable for travelling merchant purchase of thing have drawn heavily on stock of money although several of trader on receiving hint from pertaub of purpose for

corner where network touched palace thirty yard in front of balcony projected be enclosed by thick lattice work from behind lady of tippoo harem viewed sport began with contest of fighting ram animal be placed fifty yard apart a soon a saw other showed extreme anger uttering note of defiance then began to move towards other at first slowly increasing in speed until when within few yard of one took spring meeting in mid air forehead to forehead with crash must be heard far away fell back stood for moment shaking head a if half stupefied with blow then backed two step hurled at other again after have be repeated once twice locked forehead to forehead strove to push other back for time struggle continued on equal term then weaker began to give way be pushed back step by step until strength failed altogether be pushed over on to ground when attendant at once interfered separated thirty pair of ram fought affair being to dick extremely monotonous native however took great interest in contest wagering freely on issue shouting loudly to combatant raising triumphant cry when one be adjudged victor then elephant be brought in struggle between be even tamer than between ram pushed other with forehead until one gave way when other must follow beating with trunk occasionally shoving when sport be over two party of men entered arena amid shout of satisfaction from crowd after prostrating before tippoo took up ground facing other man have on right hand four steel claw fixed to knuckle approaching other cautiously threw with left hand garland of flower wore round neck into face of opponent trying to take advantage of moment to strike blow to obtain grip blow laid open flesh a by tiger claw great object be to gain grip matter where must completely disable opponent render incapable of defending when be done combat between pair came to end after ghetties a men be named have retired buffalo be matched against tiger latter be averse to contest upon firecracker being thrown close behind sprang at buffalo who have be watching warily a tiger launched into air buffalo lowered head received on sharp horn threw distance of ten yard away effort must goad wounded tiger to continue fray so buffalo be taken out two others brought in second tiger be much more powerful beast than predecessor be indeed larger than of in cage of palace have be captured four day before be full of fight walked round buffalo three four time then with speed of lightning sprang upon breaking neck with single blow from powerful forepaw six buffalo in succession be brought in be killed one after other by tiger satisfied with what have done tiger paid attention to seventh animal walked round round arena looking for mean of escape then drawing back made short rush sprang at net be fourteen foot high strong a be pole supported net nearly gave way under impact tiger hung ten foot above ground until of guard outside ran up discharging musket into air when recommenced promenade round foot of net roaring snarling with anger a neared palace stopped uttered roar of defiance at at window then apparently something moving behind lattice work caught eye moved towards crouching then with tremendous spring launched against balcony be ten foot from ground tiger spring took clear of woodwork gave way like paper tiger burst through shout of dismay arose from multitude high above sounded scream of woman quick surajah dick cried drawing keen dagger cut through network dashed through followed by companion stand here cried a arrived below balcony steady put hand against wall then sprang on to surajah back thence to shoulder drawing pistol put one between teeth grasping other in right hand steady surajah said be going to stand on head stepped on to companion turban put left arm on balcony raised by until arm be above level tiger be standing with paw upon prostrate figure growling savagely evidently confused somewhat dismayed at piercing scream from woman most of whom have thrown down on cushion of divan dick stretched right hand forward took steady aim fired sharp snarl showed that shot have taken effect dropped pistol snatched other from mouth waited for moment until must make out tiger fired again at once dropped to ground just a great body flashed from window above surajah have have matchlock slung over shoulder before tiger must recover from spring levelled fired tiger rolled over regained foot made towards one of bullet have however struck on shoulder disabled leg movement be therefore comparatively slow have time to leap aside surajah discharged pistol into ear while dick brought down keen sword with strength upon neck tiger rolled over dead mighty shout rose from crowd have better be off dick said will have sort of question to answer slipped through hole in net again be so surrounded by people cheering applauding that must not extricate minute later soldier ran up pushed through crowd to surrounded sultan requires presence said a resistance be out of question dick surajah at once accompanied to entrance of palace be led through several large hall until entered room where tippoo be standing have just left woman apartment where have hurried to ascertain what damage have be done by tiger dick companion salaamed to ground in accordance with custom of country be brave fellow sultan said graciously braver that risked death not only from tiger for daring to look upon woman unveiled saw nothing highness dick said humbly save tiger that be standing over fallen figure noticed a soon a eye fell on fired at once second time a soon a smoke cleared so that must catch glimpse of pardon that tippoo said in faith have rendered good service for have not be for interference might have worked havoc in harem that before single one of officer men have recovered sens looked angrily round at officer standing near how come that be so quick in thought execution asked surajah a elder of two brother have done much hunting among hill highness have learned that in fighting tiger one need to be quick a well a fearless whence come tippoo asked by tongue be stranger surajah gave account that have agreed upon a to birthplace be quick witted enough to see that must not be safe to say be in service of rajah of bhor a inquiry might be made therefore said came hither to take service either with royal highness with one of rajah have a yet found opportunity of doing so be well tippoo said henceforth be officer in service apartment will be assigned to in palace here be first token of satisfaction took out heavy purse from girdle handed to surajah be free to go now will later on consider what duty will be assigned to when return report yourselves to fazli ali chamberlain indicated white bearded official among group standing beside salaaming deeply again left apartment not word be spoken until be outside precinct of palace make sudden change in plan dick said whether for better worse can not say yet be right in not saying be in service of rajah of bhor be not thought that tippoo must offer to take into service might have caused letter to be sent to rajah saying that have done so yes be quite right surajah have thought of myself be on thorn when be telling story felt not little relieved when changed tale think that have turned out for best a officer of palace may be able to obtain information a to what christian captive there be prison where be confined still more surajah said when get to be known a being officer might present boldly at of hill fortress a sent there with order be right dick said have not thought of indeed might even produce order to inspect prisoner in order to render account to tippoo of state fitness for service might even show order for father to be handed over to if must find be splendid be sure can not be too grateful to tiger for popping into harem have done more for in few minute than must have achieved in year well surajah if father be alive think now that have chance of rescuing a walked through street many of who have be present at sport recognised a hero in stirring episode there judging must gain high place in tippoo favour came up to congratulated on bravery made offer of service replied civilly to who accosted be glad when turned off to quiet quarter where pertaub lived hindoo be surprised indeed when told what have happened that be already officer in palace might consider a standing high in tippoo favour be wonderful said when brought story to conclusion surely providence must have favoured pious object such good fortune must never have occurred to have not be that be destined must find father still alive if good fortune befalls be because deserve that must face great tiger without hesitation slay show how firm courage be quickness be still more to be admired doubt there be many others there who to gain favour of sultan must have risked life alone of be quick enough to carry out be nearest to spot pertaub have be among crowd farther back must have done nothing let praise be given where be due surajah said have nothing to do with affair saw tiger bound through window heard scream stood frozen with horror did not even see lord cut through net knew nothing until seized by arm pulled after be not until sprang upon back then upon shoulder that knew what be going to do simply aided in despatching tiger when sprang wounded down into courtyard yet be hunter soldier pertaub said be how be that english have become lord of so wide territory be quick while hesitate spend great time in making up mind to do anything decide act in moment be always ready be always slow see point where blow have to be struck make straight to strike english sahib be very young yet to come in moment what be best thing to be done doe not stop to think of danger while others stand in consternation act slays tiger before one of have so much a moved from place indeed a say tippoo told danger be not only from tiger tyrant must indeed have be alarmed for safety of harem when forgave what in eye of mohammedan be greatest offence can commit will of course change of plan for present at rate may be that later on will still find occasion for disguise a possibly may fall into disfavour have to assume to make escape may a tippoo officer manage to obtain entrance into one two of hill fortress unless absolutely sent by be utmost must hope for for be missing messenger must be sent over country to order arrest in case must have to take to disguise first thing now be to procure dress how much be there in purse surajah seems pretty heavy surajah poured gold out on table there be fifty tomauns will be more than enough to clothe handsomely hindoo said much more than enough must think pertaub tippoo like round to be well dressed be not only proof of generosity like to make brave show on great occasion nothing plea more than to be told that nizam other indian prince can surpass in magnificence of court therefore better dressed be more will be satisfied for will seem to that appreciate honour of being officer of palace that have laid out present to best advantage have not mind to hoard of will take matter in hand for will need two suit one for court ceremony other for ordinary wear in palace will be very much obliged to pertaub for indeed have idea what ought to be got have better present ourselves at palace evening tomorrow

not help smiling at manner in people in street obsequiously made way for will be very glad said a traversed space divided town from fort when have got over next day two have settled down bit seems so uncertain have not most remote idea of what duty be likely to be hitherto have always have definite plan of action have only ourselves to depend upon now everything seems doubtful uncertain however suppose will soon settle down have satisfaction of knowing that if thing turn out well can go off to good friend pertaub get out of place altogether on arriving at palace inquired for chamberlain be expecting lord one of attendant said coming forward will lead first to room be prepared for then take to fazli room be commodious one richness of covering of divan handsome rug spread on floor be

behaviour can give idea what duty will be surajah asked a dick have requested always to be spokesman if possible chamberlain shook head will be for sultan to decide for time probably will have little to do to attend at hour when give public audience will doubtless occasionally carry order to officer in command of troop at distant place will form part of retinue when go beyond palace when see that be worthy of favour prompt in carrying out order in respect trustworthy will in time assign special duty to will depend upon yourselves a one who admires courage promptness that showed today who wish well must warn that be best when sultan have have matter to trouble may blame somewhat unjustly not to seek to excuse yourselves be bad to thwart when be roused can rely upon to stand friend when storm have blown over to represent matter to in favourable light sultan desire to be just in calm moment assuredly be so when there be cloud before eye there be saying upon whom displeasure may fall at present however there be little chance of falling into disgrace for be greatly impressed with service have rendered especially by promptness with carried out after have gone spoke very strongly about said that must be possessed of hundred officer capable of such deed must in case have little fear of of foe of kingdom be fortunate that came here afternoon be well nigh certain that will ask

order on subject have appeared in dress wore morning must doubtless have instructed to provide with more suitable attire fact that have so laid out money will show that have understanding of honour of

towards tippoo great sultan said be young men whom have pleased highness to appoint officer in palace two lad salaamed until turban touched ground truly be comely youth tippoo said one must scarcely deem capable of performing such feat a accomplished morning well slayer of tiger have found everything fitly provided far more so than deed merit highness surajah replied have found everything that heart must desire only hope for opportunity to show worthy of favour have done beforehand tippoo said graciously be glad to see by attire that be conscious that a officer be fitting must make worthy appearance show that have be well brought up be not ignorant of what be right proper at present will receive order from fazli ali will act a assistant chamberlain until decide in what way service can be made most useful now follow there be others who wish to see rising tippoo led way through door with double hanging into room considerably larger than have just left chandelier at end of room where stood be lighted while other end be in comparative darkness leaving standing alone tippoo walked towards other end clapped hand immediately number of closely veiled figure entered completely filling end of room be young men tippoo said to be one on right to whom be chiefly due that tiger did not commit havoc among be who climbed up balcony fired twice at beast owe life to companion for among officer guard there be not one who be quick witted enough to move a much a finger there be faint murmur of surprise among veiled figure at youth of preserver hold head fully up tippoo went on for dick companion after making deep salaam have stood with bent head with eye fixed upon ground then two of attendant girl of thirteen fourteen year old came forward from behind others bearing casket be presented to with permission by lady whose life saved tippoo said must at time have favour to ask even must fall under displeasure can rely upon good office in behalf there be low murmur from other end of hall then tippoo clapped hand woman moved out a noiselessly a have entered can retire now tippoo said a moved towards door into other room be faithful be discreet fortune be assured pointed to

fortune be favouring mightily morning walked street in fear of being questioned arrested evening be officer of palace favoured by tippoo under protection of harem wonder what lady have given opened casket be of considerable size a examined content exclamation of surprise broke from contained thirty forty little parcel done up in paper on being opened be found to contain trinket jewel of kind be very costly valuable be handsome be evident that one of lady who have be in room when tiger burst in have contributed token of gratitude many of more valuable gem have be evidently taken from setting a if donor did not care that jewel have worn must be exposed to view one parcel contained twenty superb pearl magnificent diamond ten ruby so on down to more humble gift although be valuable of of lower rank dick present be much more costly than of companion a soon a be seen to be case dick proposed that must be put together divided equally however surajah must not hear of whole thing be due to said must never have occurred to to interfere at have part in matter beyond aiding to kill wounded tiger be no more than have done many time among hill thought nothing of jewel be vastly more than deserve for share in affair know much about value of gem must be worth large sum nothing will induce to take of that have so well earned wonder whether tippoo know what have given dick said after in vain trying to alter companion decision suppose troubled about surajah replied doubt be asked for permission for to make present to jewel in harem must be of enormous value a for last fifteen year have be gathering spoil from southern india having swept land right up to gate of madras say that treasure be fabulous doubt lady of harem have shared largely in spoil question be what have best do with casket know that in course of adventure may very well happen that will be closely searched must never do to risk having such valuable found upon must say that have best bury somewhere of merchant here may be honest enough for to leave jewel in care without anxiety a may at moment be seized compelled to give up last penny thing must be safer with than with a to pertaub have absolute faith in be liable to be seized at moment however must say have better consult if be to bury say under floor of house might leave there for time if saw chance of place being someday captured by people must wait till then for recovery war may not be renewed for year possibly pertaub may be able to arrange to send down only entrusting portion at time to messenger so that if got into trouble must only lose what have upon will put casket into box lock up for present take down to pertaub tomorrow evening after get dark will be a well to get off mind a soon a possible for although just at present be in high favour there be saying how long may last when may be necessary for to move chapter officer of palace next morning just a have finished early breakfast be sent for by fazli ali have better accompany on round said will not commit special duty to until see whether sultan intends that will remain with whether a be far more likely assigns other work to be placed in separate charge in palace must have to fill place if left therefore propose that at present will assist in general supervision will first go to kitchen give more trouble than other part of duty in first place one have to see that contractor do work properly that number of carcase sent in be correct flesh of good quality that list of game be correct then one have to check amount of rice other grain sent in from storehouse issue of spice other article of kind matter require doing day kitchen officer be responsible for once twice week take care to be present to see that be right then ascertain that everything be in good proper order in kitchen listen to complaint decide dispute when have done there will see that requisition from harem be properly complied with that sweetmeat perfume silk muslin a required be furnished payment of salary doe not come into department be one of function of treasurer of palace who also discharge account upon signature that be correct then take general tour of palace to see that

entirely upon sultan if there be state ceremonial in palace summon whose duty be to attend see that everything be properly arranged in order if not be generally at highness disposal unless receive instruction from will be free to occupy yourselves a like will of course take part in public ceremonial will be among officer who accompany sultan when go out will be liable to be summoned to attend at time therefore although free to go into town ride beyond island be well that must never be long absent that if wish to be away for more than two hour at time must first let know a may be able to tell if sultan be likely to require have fixed pay at four hundred rupee month dick a accompanied chamberlain on tour through palace be struck with order method prevailed in department chamberlain told that tippoo inquired closely into detail large a be daily expenditure waste of kind be allowed splendour of of apartment be surprising especially throne room throne be of extraordinary magnificence be of gold thickly inlaid with gem on apex stood jewelled peacock covered entirely with diamond emerald ruby with pendant of pearl in front of stood golden tiger head served a footstool on side be standard of purple silk having sun with gold ray in centre spear head be of gold set with jewel when work of inspection be finished went back to room where attendant soon afterwards with air of great exultation brought meal consisted of nine dish proof of high favour with tippoo regarded after meal be eaten went down to stable be pleased indeed with mount provided for be fine animal with handsome saddle trapping dick surajah at once mounted rode through town to other extremity of island a wore scarf have be furnished by fazli ali showing that be officer of palace be everywhere greeted with deep salaam hope dick said a returned from ride that tippoo will not be long before find other duty there be nothing very interesting in counting carcase seeing rice measured be true enough surajah agreed must not be impatient fortune have befriended marvellously have great faith that will continue to do so must be content to wait yes know that surajah think be more difficult to do so because have done so much in short time seems a if one ought to go on at same rate that evening went down a have arranged with ordinary wrap round gay attire to pertaub taking with casket of gem hindoo received warmly saw ride through street morning although did not notice truly made good appearance be well mounted have heard from one of people who be servant in palace that stand in high favour have brought down two casket of gem dick said be given by lady of harem many of stone surajah think be very valuable know what to do with wanted to know whether must arrange to send down to tripataly for must not undertake to do so if be valuable pertaub said prospect of fresh trouble be stronger day road be so closely watched especially through pass that must be running terrible risk to trust valuable to anyone in case pertaub thought might bury in ground under house first look at of stone tell think of hindoo opened surajah casket undid many of little parcel assuredly be valuable said of much more so than others if be like have opened must be worth at least fifty thousand rupee now look at casket pertaub hindoo uttered exclamation of surprise a opened of packet taking out of larger gem examined by light of lamp must not place value on said at last lady must indeed have felt that owed life to gem be fortune doubtless be spoil of score of district tippoo must have distributed lavishly among wife must never have made such rich present must bury sahib for surely must not be entrusted even to most faithful messenger in time like though if like will hide here think must be far safer for to take across river bury in wood marking well tree that may know place again for although methinks tippoo agent believe that have squeezed last rupee from one can never tell might again be tortured none can say that be brave enough to bear agony that tippoo executioner inflict will bury for tonight pray give notice first time cross river will be at other side of ford with jewel hidden in sack on as will drive forward when see crossing ford will follow till enter wood will have tool when join can go on short distance bury wish to see where hide will move about to make sure that none come near when so engaged have best take out few small stone will find a good a money much more easily concealed for in town large village will find jeweller who will give silver for think will be very good plan pertaub will certainly carry out month passed without change in work rode with other officer behind tippoo palanquin when went out did almost day to inspect progress of fortification be among brilliant circle behind throne when gave order by time have come to know most of other court official be able to inquire cautiously about prison must learn nothing however of english prisoner in seringapatam save have seen in hut in fort six week after appointment a palace officer dick surajah be sent for by tippoo be about to employ sultan said when appeared before on mission be stranger here be unconnected with of officer can therefore place greater reliance on report than upon of men who have other interest than own to serve desire to go inspect hill fort to see how repair of fortification injured by english be progressing to make sure that cannon be in good order supply of ammunition plentiful have shown that be quick sighted sharp look round defence if see aught can be done to strengthen confer with governor learn opinion on subject if agree with will be authorised to take men from country round to strengthen fortification will forward at once such gun store a may be required after inspection of fort will despatch mounted messenger to with report will state fort will next visit in order may despatch there order may have to give do duty well will know how to reward in order that authority may be increased be named colonel in army fazli will furnish with written copy of order have given with authority under seal to enter inspect fortress to consult with governor a to everything considered by a necessary for better defence last time english came captured nundidroog other hill fortress that have regarded a impregnable simply because governor be overconfident defence have be neglected must not occur again if there be failure in defence will hold responsible therefore take care that neglect not only to see that repair be being well carried out to recommend addition to fortification wherever seems to that there be even possibility of enemy making way up will take with twenty trooper a escort be not to enter of fortress with for treachery be always possible one save garrison must be acquainted with defence of hill fort surajah expressed thanks to sultan for entrusting with mission assured that inspection of fort must be careful complete that must start in hour time when reached own room dick threw up turban in delight be there ever stroke of good fortune exclaimed tiger business be a nothing to tippoo have given

told be diligent in service felt sure must do best in present matter that a be accustomed in pursuit of game to ascend mountain scale precipice be far more likely to find weak spot in fort than old officer who must be likely to take everything for granted there be doubt that many of garrison be very far from being efficient have be stationed in fort for many year discipline among officer men be sure to have become lax there will be much that young men going freshly into matter will see need amendment that wall be often weak cannon so old a to be almost useless be well aware for sometimes newly appointed governor have sent in strong protest urgent request that might be furnished with new cannon that wall defence might be renewed what with war removal of capital building fortification of place matter have be neglected be only now that sultan see necessity of putting fortification of place in good repair have have paper prepared signed escort have be ordered be there anything else can think of must like to take palace attendant with surajah said be good man starting so suddenly must have difficulty in hiring servant must rely on have thought of that chamberlain replied have ordered horse to be got in readiness for together with spare animal to carry food necessary for journey will need on march may even be glad of in of smaller fort where fare will be very rough when

case tippoo must send for to give final instruction can say must ask have gone down to town to get supply of powder ball for pistol writing material other thing that may require will be true enough be most lucky that buried jewel in forest ten day ago for must not have have time to do now dick returned in time for meal be brought up by servant pertaub be delighted to hear of good fortune said on return will keep disguise by if have occasion for will either bring with merchandise will send by trusty messenger to place may mention directly hears from think there be chance of wanting be a well to prepare for contingency may occur hour later started at head of escort of twenty trooper ibrahim riding in rear leading pack horse carried change of clothes thick cloth to keep out night dew a well a stock of provision ibrahim have also purchased two very large dark blanket must be used for temporary shelter surajah now felt quite at home for be engaged in same sort of duty performed at tripataly more than one pair of dark eye glanced admiringly at two young officer a rode down to ford have be furnished by fazli with list of fort be to visit order in be to take first on list being savandroog fifty mile northeast of city after ride of twenty mile halted at village to surprise of trooper surajah gave order that nothing be to be taken by force a be prepared to pay for provision required a soon a villager understood ample supply be brought in rice grain fowl be purchased for soldier forage for horse after seeing that be well provided for two officer went to room have be placed at service in principal house in village ibrahim justified assertion that be good cook by turning out excellent curry by time have finished be getting dark after again visiting trooper seeing that own horse be fed well groomed retired to bed early start be made at ten o'clock approached savandroog be one of most formidable of hill fort of mysore stood upon summit of enormous mass of granite covering base of eight mile in circuit rising in ragged precipice to height of foot summit of rock be divided by deep chasm into two peak of be crowned with strong work capable of separate defence lower part of hill be wherever ascent seemed possible protected by wall one behind other native have regarded fort a absolutely impregnable until be stormed by troop under lord cornwallis dick looked with intense interest at great rock with numerous fortification damage committed by british gun must not be seen at distance seemed to well nigh impossible that place must have be captured rode on until neared entrance in wall encircled fort at side at alone access be considered possible be challenged a approached ordering trooper to remain behind dick surajah rode forward be bearer surajah cried out a reined in horse within twenty yard of gate of order from sultan for admittance of letter to mirzah mohammed bukshy governor will send up word to officer on wall replied can admit one until have received order to do so how long will be before receive answer hour half at earliest regret that excellency will be inconvenienced order be absolute blame surajah replied be necessary that must always be vigilant retired under shade of tree hundred fifty yard from gate ibrahim spread out rug then proceeded to light fire to prepare pillau of rice fowl while dick companion regarded rock with fixed attention conversed together a to possibility of ascending at of point so steep a to be left undefended by wall concluded at last that must be next to impossible to climb rock anywhere on side faced save by scaling several wall have just finished luncheon when gate opened officer four soldier issued out at once rose went to meet have governor order to admit on production of sultan pas surajah produced document officer at once recognised seal carried to forehead salaaming deeply trooper can enter at gate can not proceed farther than second wall can ride up must walk dick asked can ride replied road be steep nowhere so steep that horse can not mount after party have entered gate be at once closed bolted trooper dismounted be led to small barrack while surajah dick accompanied by officer four soldier on foot rode on road be better one than dick have expected be just wide enough for cart to proceed up be cut out of solid rock turned zigzagged continually at angle be small fort whose gun swept approach passed under score of gateway defended by gun after upwards of hour climbing at quick pace approached one of fort on summit governor met at gate will pardon not descending to meet below said be not so young a used to be journey up down fatigue much dick surajah dismounted former presented two document governor after reading pas bowed led way into interior of fort be soon seated on divan in quarter when read circular letter be glad indeed said when have finished that sultan be pleased to take into consideration many demand have made for cannon ammunition large number of piece be past service must be a dangerous to who fired a to at whom be aimed while have scarcely powder enough to furnish three round for a to defence have done best to strengthen idleness be bad for men most of for soldier have kept well employed at repairing effect of english fire still there be much to do yet before be finished there be point where fortification might be added with advantage will gladly point out to have be beyond mean here for a will perceive will need blasting in many place to scarp rock to render inaccessible several point at active men can now climb up for work powder be required must submit that for such hard work will be needful to supply extra ration to troop for present scale scarcely suffices to keep men efficient especially a most of have wife family dependent on have doubt that sultan will accede to reasonable request excellency be anxious that wall of fort must be placed in best possible condition for defence one doubt that will ere long be again at war with england although sultan relies much upon large reinforcement have be promised by france with whom have entered into alliance have not yet arrived may have to bear brunt of attack of english by have heard of governor said regret that will again have feringhees upon a for mahratti nizam heed not be dust whom sultan must sweep from path english be terrible soldier have fought against under hyder in last war again showed valour strangest thing be that make native under fight a bravely a do a to fort nothing be safe from be troop of nizam mahratti combined to besiege must feel perfectly safe while be there five hundred englishman must tremble for safety of fortress have come up hill have seen for yourselves how strong be yet took place without loss of single man be not here for be in command of kistnagherry at time succeeded in holding against assault when war be over kistnagherry be ceded to be appointed to fortress seems to to be even stronger than be commander be brave man garrison be strong there be suspicion of treachery though at last troop be seized with panic a might well be when saw that be unable to arrest advance of enemy defence up to time have be stout english brought up gun where be thought gun must be taken knocked defence to piece after winning way to top in one day captured fort that on hill yonder seems miraculous coffee be brought in pipe for although tippoo be violently opposed to smoking one must venture upon use of tobacco in palace fort old officer like governor in distant command did not relinquish tobacco be necessary here governor said a filled pipe country round be terribly unhealthy air be full of fever discourage use among men for must die off like fly did not smoke to keep out bad air climate be indeed best protection to fort for army sat down for length of time before must speedily melt away opened box stood on divan beside have copy here said taking paper out of memorial have sent in to sultan a to gun be last be sent in two month ago see asked for forty nine heavy piece of thirty be to replace gun be honeycombed split other eleven be for new work asked for thirty two lighter one howitzer hundred wall gun of course must do with le to place fort in perfect state of defence be number artillery officer think be requisite of powder have not more than ton half if siege be to be long one might require ten time a much have not more than eight round of shot for gun ought to have at least fifty for heavy piece twenty for defending path up hill dick made note of figure in pocket book have bought for purpose a for provision governor went on ought to have large store of rice grain magazine be nearly empty a have eight hundred men in garrison perhaps twice a many woman child must require large store be blockaded for time be troop in good condition surajah asked governor shook head many of be past term of service until get reinforcement to supply place will not venture to discharge many others be wasted by fever must say from insufficient ration not only weakens body lower spirit a long a there be fear of attack mattered little if english be coming again will want well fed contented men to oppose see by star on turban that be colonel a well a officer of palace be fortunate in obtaining that rank so young be due to sultan favour surajah said other day at sport tiger burst into sultan zenana be lucky enough to kill be friend did most of killing only gave brute final coup ah be who performed that deed governor said warmly heard news from one of officer who be on leave returned yesterday truly be gallant action one quickly done wonder that obtained sultan favour rank a colonel be sportsman in young day think must have be more frightened at thought of taking peep into sultan zenana than must have be of fighting tiger did not think anything about dick said until be over heard woman scream being quite close went to assistance without thought whether might be lady of zenana servant of palace indeed saw nothing save tiger only vaguely observed that there be woman there at be well that sultan took view did of matter governor said have known men put to death for deed be trifle in comparison to looking into zenana now colonel will send for artillery officer horse will ride round fortification on brow of hill inspect two fort closely will point out to spot where appears to defence ought to be strengthened chapter surprise dick be much pleased with governor be evidently outspoken old soldier though rough bearded face have honest kindly expression thought to if father fell into hand think must be treated with unnecessary hardship though doubt sultan order must be obeyed when soldier came in to say that horse be at door went out officer be standing beside governor presented a chief artillery officer have not brought horse said excellency distance be not great must need to dismount so many time to get view from wall that must not be worthwhile to ride in case may a well walk also dick said must rather do so too governor said proposed riding because thought might be tired a bakir meeram say distance be not great wall with exception of of two fort be not more than mile in extent for in most place rock go sheer down there defence be of course unnecessary will inspect fort first went round of wall dick companion listening to suggestion of two officer principal one be that wall must be raised inside gate english last time got in here by rushing in at tail of fugitive from below be in before gate must be closed took men so completely by surprise that be seized with panic be to raise semicircular wall behind gateway thing must not occur again governor said of course there must be gate in inner wall not immediately behind outer gateway a if so placed might be destroyed by cannon shot battered outer gate in must therefore put at one end of inner wall gate must be generally open in case of siege must have blocked up with stone piled behind placing number of ladder by men running in must get on to wall however closely be pursued must make stand there until ladder be pulled up must be excellent idea surajah said gravely will certainly lay before sultan suppose must propose same for other fort just same only thing must observe dick said be that if enemy once got footing on top here must not hope to make long defence of fort be so governor agreed strength of defence be not here on upward road if english once gained top fort must fall at least will not be said a long a be governor savandroog fell almost bloodlessly in fort can at least die bravely sell life to last be for reason desire that will be so defended that can not be carried a be before by sudden rush other fort be then visited tour made round wall suggestion offered by governor officer be noted down approved then made what be to dick most important part of inspection namely examination of undefended portion of rock result showed that builder of defence have not acted unwisely in trusting solely to nature at many point rock fell away in precipice hundred of foot deep at other point although descent be le steep be a far a must see from above altogether unclimbable thought must be able to judge better from below do have sentry round here at night asked governor must not be necessary even if enemy be encamped below if will ride round foot of hill when leave will see for save from side came up place be absolutely inaccessible view from top of hill be superb away to northeast governor pointed out pagoda of bangalore twenty two mile away distance in clear air seeming comparatively trifling be there many troop there dick asked there be about five battalion of regular troop three chelah battalion can hardly be counted a troop have never be of slightest use in last war ran like sheep be fancy of sultan indeed can hardly expect men to fight who have be forced into rank made to accept mohammedanism against will naturally regard invader not a enemy a deliverer of course sultan idea be that since native troop drilled led by englishman fought so well chelahs who be also drilled led by englishman must do same company troop be willing soldier be english leading more than english drill make fight if chelahs be divided among hill fortress might do good service must a far a fighting go do with battalion of here for mixed up with men must have to do duty of course will never be placed in hill fort for one must never be safe from treachery even if lower wall be in hand of own men of chelahs must be sure to manage to desert give information a to defence considerable portion of upper plateau of rock be occupied by hut of troop for fort be much too small to contain family on way back passed through dick looked anxiously about for white face must see none building seemed to likely to be used a prison when returned to governor quarter found that room have be placed at disposal presently sat down to dinner with suppose have english prisoner here dick said carelessly when meal be over governor paused moment before replied want of here said shortly batch be sent up sometimes from bangalore be only for execution be loyal subject of sultan must that work must be done elsewhere almost execution take place in hill fort in order suppose that may be done secretly obey order never see carried out never even see captive have done harm at most one of number have tried to escape for be not to be blamed always have shot whether be mode of execution ordered not be soldier death one must choose so that be dead can matter little to sultan how die if be shot a soon a be taken must not think so much of after being held captive for year compelled to work seems to that life must be spared a far a giving up own life be concerned must willingly do at order of sultan execution make ill lose appetite for week afterwards let talk of something else governor puffed furiously away at hookah have just lighted then conversation turned to fort again find life dull said in answer to remark of dick did so at first one soon becomes accustomed to have wife two daughter there be ten officer so can have company when choose officer be married give society up here observe strictly rule of plain although lady of course wear veil when go beyond house put aside indoors family mix freely with other so that get on very well see there be very few change ever made a many of lady be like wife no longer young treat a comrade in morning dick surajah mounted horse took hearty farewell of governor rode down to gate soldier have be sent down hour before found escort in readiness to move have decided that before going to next fort must ride round foot of hill of savandroog did going at foot pace scanning cliff slope a passed sometimes reined up horse rode little farther back so a to have view to very summit when completed round agreed that there be two spot where seemed to that ascent be barely possible be very doubtful whether difficulty when examined more closely must not prove to be absolutely insurmountable be not satisfactory outlook dick said fortunately there be now motive for climbing precipice certainly place must be of use to party wanting to make attack in first place though might get up with soft shoe on be sure that english soldier with musket ammunition pouch must never do especially at night in daytime even if body of troop strong enough to be of use must get up who first arrived at top must be killed before others must come to assistance few stone rolled down must sweep behind to bottom like turning back on place went on a turned horse head to south for savandroog be farthest north of fort be to visit seems to that even now father may be there how can that be dick surajah said in surprise nothing must be more straightforward than governor seemed to be thought that be even rash in speaking a frankly a did to think saw there be fear of repeating what said surajah be frank outspoken old soldier have evidently be so disgusted at treatment of prisoner that must not mince word yet know did not absolutely say that have prisoner noticed that did not reply directly to question on contrary distinctly hesitated before spoke now why must have done that might just a well have said 'no have prisoner be only sent up here for execution ' must have be natural answer instead of that hesitated then began ' want of here batch be sent up sometimes from bangalore now why did shirk question if have be other subject might not have noticed that have not really answered of course a be so important one be listening most anxiously for reply noticed hesitation at once that gave direct answer at now think over surajah why must have hesitated why must have turned question off without answering unless there have be reason if so what must reason be surajah have suggestion to make rode on for distance in silence be quite evident dick went on after long pause that be kind hearted man that object altogether to tippoo cruelty to prisoner therefore if have captive reason for not answering be most likely kindly one yes must think so see must consider that must report to sultan particular have gathered about fortress remark about execution of prisoner worthlessness of chelah battalion so on be private conversation be only matter of opinion supposing have have prisoner have said so might for anything knew have have order to inspect to report about a well a about garrison defence yes might have thought that surajah agreed after why must mind that dick did not answer for time be trying to think out presently reined in horse suddenly might be reason said excitedly governor may be very one who heard have taken father with when be moved from fort up in north be in command at kistnagherry before came here after war may have gone to kistnagherry from fort in north see there have be execution have be of fresh batch sent up governor must not include captive have brought with in time very existence may have be forgotten may still be living there must account for governor objection to answering question a must be sure that did tippoo hear there be prisoner there must send order for to be executed at once may be fancy surajah can not think of other reason why must have shirked question took up rein again horse at once started forward rode for little time in silence dick thinking matter over again again becoming more more convinced be right except that a admitted to prisoner whom governor wished to shield might not be father be roused at last by surajah asking question be there anything that must like to now dick replied must not go back again must visit other fort on list see what can find out there when have quite assured ourselves that father be not in of can think over again at present must put aside however sha' rest until get to bottom of during next ten day inspected fort of navandroog sundradroog outradroog chitteldroog few of be a extensive none so strong a savandroog did official part of business assured that english captive be contained in of governor said that prisoner be never kept there many day that be only when tippoo wished to get rid of that be sent there none of governor made objection to answering dick question on subject generally adding expression of satisfaction that prisoner be never left long under charge entail lot of trouble governor of outradroog said have to be watched incessantly one never feel certain may not slip away look at place must think that one must make escape yet ten year ago fourteen of got away from here slid down precipice where one must have thought human being must have got down alive be of retaken except one executed following day sultan be so furious that although be fault of governor who have sentry placed everywhere sent for to seringapatam threw to tiger declaring that there must have be treachery at work may be sure have desire to hold english prisoner after when have be sent here have be glad indeed when order came for execution good many be ordered to be starved to death never waited for that took too long do must guard must smuggle in piece of bread lingered on for week so that be more merciful to finish with at once besides making feel comfortable at knowledge that there be chance of making escape there be sentry at door a well a on wall when fourteen have told about escaped dug passage out at back of hut chose very dark night be only when sound of stone that dislodged a scrambled down precipice gave alarm to sentry escape be discovered want prisoner up here when do come there be sleep for until get order to execute often come now most of prisoner who be not given up have be killed since there be not many of left upon finishing round returned to seringapatam where dick drew up full report of result of investigation sultan went through with questioned closely cut off good many of item gave order that other demand must be complied with gun ammunition sent off at once to various fort from great arsenal at capital dick be depressed at result of journey hope have fallen lower lower a at fort visited heard same story that prisoner sent up to mountain fortress have in short time be put to death be possible of course that father might still be at one of town where new levy have be drilled have not from first thought likely that merchant sailor must be put to work have not be that clung to belief that there be prisoner at savandroog that prisoner be father must have begun to despair be true that there be still many hill fort scattered about country unvisited there seemed reason why of prisoner must have be allowed to survive in fort when have be put to death in have visited among be place have be most used a prison must give up said to surajah be not that in first place must almost break mother heart conviction that father be still alive have never be shaken have supported year believe be to return tell that be no longer possible to hope faith must still be unshaken must still think of a pining in dungeon must consider have given up search from faint heartedness be chief reason own be almost a much influenced by own conviction that be in savandroog quite admit can give reason why if there be prisoner there must be father yet can not get out of mind that be suppose be because have conviction believe in why must have impression so strongly if be not true one tell that be absurd have real ground to go upon yet doe not shake faith in slightest be perhaps because have be so fortunate altogether everything have turned out so favourably that ca help thinking be alive that will find what do think surajah ought to give up why must surajah replied stoutly think be right that be destined to find father there be hurry have not be anything like so long time a expected to be fortune have a say befriended wonderfully be well off here have position of honour for myself must wish for nothing better well at rate will wait for time dick said may be sent to savandroog again if so will not leave place until find out from governor whether have still prisoner if so manage to obtain sight of next day dick be informed by chamberlain that officer who be in charge of wild beast have fallen into disgrace that sultan have appointed to charge dick be well pleased in respect work must suit much better than examining store seeing that servant of palace did duty on other hand lessened chance of being sent to savandroog again however there be choice in matter surajah cheered by saying must not mind dick have not everything turned out for best may be sure that will turn out so also be indeed two day later that dick congratulated upon change for surajah be sent by tippoo with order for execution of four english prisoner dick knew nothing of matter until surajah on return told that have be obliged to stop see order carried out by poison being forced down unfortunate officer throat be horrible said with tear in eye horrible dick repeated thank god have be put to other work for feel must not have done yet to have refused to carry out tyrant order must have meant death to while must not have saved life of poor fellow anyhow must not have done a soon a have received order must have come to must have mounted ridden off together taken chance let talk of something else surajah said be beast in good health a well a can be when be fed so badly so miserably cooped up made great row morning have kept men at work day in cleaning out place be in horrible state before must get work done have to threaten to report whole of to tippoo knew what must come of told fazli last night that beast must have more flesh got order from that bone from kitchen must be given to that evening when dick on way to apartment of one of officer be going along corridor skirted portion of palace occupied by zenana figure came out suddenly from behind drapery of door dropped on knee beside seizing hand pressed to forehead be to appearance indian girl in dress of one of attendant of zenana what be child said must have mistaken for someone else bahador said be wanted to thank one of other attendant saw go along corridor time ago ever since have watched here of evening whenever must get away unobserved in hope of seeing be lord whom tiger be standing over when came to rescue be not greatly hurt for be pushed down when tiger burst in save that seized with one of paw tore shoulder be unhurt ever since have be hoping that time must come when must thank for saving life be glad to have done so child have best retire into zenana must not be good for be found talking to girl rose to foot submissively now saw face in dim light that burnt in corridor have not hitherto noticed why exclaimed with start be english yes sahib be brought here eight year ago be fourteen now there be other english girl here then be older than have be given away to officer of sultan be afraid will be too ere long have dreaded so much oh sahib be favourite of sultan if must give to must not mind so much dick be about to reply when heard distant footfall go in exclaimed someone be coming will speak to again in day two when returned to room told surajah what have happened will at rate give fresh interest here said be terrible to think that young english girl must be in tippoo power that can give whenever like to one of creature of course according to english notion be still young girl a people out here marry when girl be of age of child be different altogether doe not suspect that be english a told have only just discovered that be so when heard footstep in distance will see again tomorrow next day will be running great risk surajah said gravely not much risk think dick replied be only little slave girl a tiger be standing over when fired doubt did save life must be natural enough that must on meeting speak to express thanks must be good excuse surajah agreed suspicious tyrant like tippoo might well insist that be only pretence that girl be really giving letter message from one of inmate of zenana dick be silent for time will be very careful said must certainly see again seems to at present risk there may be must try to save poor girl from fate that awaits can not conceal from that however much may refuse to admit hope of finding saving father be faint indeed although girl be nothing to must feel that mission have not be entire failure if must take home with restore to friend think went on in answer to grave shake of surajah head that must add to danger in getting away know that if try to escape be caught life will be forfeited in case if be disguised a boy must travel with without attracting more observation than must alone must not be missed for hour after have left there must be reason for connecting departure with ours say surajah have made up mind about of course have come fresh to have not have time to think over in way still doe seem to that when time for leaving come whether ride off openly a tippoo officer whether go off in disguise there ought to be very great difficulty in taking away with see that ca give opinion about at present surajah replied do think that will add to difficulty however may go say can not be managed must think not surajah must be worth doing however great difficulty might be just think of grief that parent must feel at loss joy when be restored to see must be no great loss of time if be obliged to take down to tripataly first then come back again to renew search must take week going returning now that pass be open to difficulty must be nothing to what be when went back after scouting expedition besides at time be more vigilant along frontier than will be now because there be war between two country tippoo be anxious that news of movement must be taken down there be talk of war now for though tippoo make disguise of fury at loss especially at coorg being taken from be evidently bent upon fighting again will take very long time to get army into efficient state to repair fortress to complete new work of defence be getting up here to restore confidence of soldier must think will be fully four five year before be ready to fight again at rate if once get well away from here with girl ought to have difficulty in getting across frontier must mean fortnight lost in search for father anyhow be not making progress way a long a stop here only drawback must be so far a can see that must lose benefit of official position unless happen to be sent off with order to other hill fort position will only hamper movement besides must still have badge of office tippoo official order to governor possibly news that have disappeared might reach governor of of fort in neighbourhood must not be likely to travel very far officer so frequently fall into disgrace be killed thrown to tiger that fact of being missing must scarce excite remark who heard of must suppose that have be secretly made away with that having learned that tippoo be displeased with have fled surajah nodded confidence in leader be complete be always ready to follow unquestioningly there be one thing surajah dick concluded state of thing can not last much longer anyhow for next time might be ordered to see to execution of english prisoner must mean must a soon a received command make bolt for so see stay here in case may not last many day must rather run risk than carry out such order two evening later dick went down corridor at same hour a on have before met english girl came out from behind hanging at once when passed knew must come bahador said joyfully must see that be a kind a be brave must have pity upon poor little white slave have much want to say to child be not good place for speaking someone might come along at moment how long can be away without fear of absence being noticed not long now said in morning be sent out on message must meet anywhere very well will remain in room morning tomorrow if come then will stay in next day will come girl said unhesitatingly then gave full instruction how to find room made repeat to in order to be sure that have correctly do know companion by sight asked oh yes have seen often well either will be standing at door be a well that must look carefully round before enter so a to be sure there be one in corridor that can slip in unobserved may be sure that be asking to come for idle freak because have something very important to say to fancy hear footstep good night dick be sure that surajah must be at liberty next day for tippoo have that morning started for bangalore where large number of men be at work repairing fortification removing sign of british occupation from fort palace be likely to be away for at least fortnight a soon a ibrahim have swept room after early breakfast dick gave number of small commission to be executed in town told that must not require again until be time to bring up meal from kitchen then surajah by turn watched at door hour later surajah who be upon watch said girl be coming there be one else in sight when surajah beckoned to hurried on passing through curtain at door entered room have be arranged that surajah must remain on watch so must by chance one of official of acquaintance come along might go out talk with in corridor on excuse other prevent entering room if showed intention of doing so now in first place dick said a led girl to divan seated there what be name name be goorla mean proper name name used to be annie annie mansfield bahador name be dick holland said in english gave start of surprise yes annie be countryman of yours looked at almost incredulously then expression of aversion succeeded that of confidence in face sprang from divan drew up indignantly please let go said haughtily have saved life if have saved twenty time must not like man who be deserter dick have at first be speechless with astonishment at girl change of manner at reception of news have thought must have be very pleasant to a last word threw light upon matter burst into merry laugh be deserter annie save friend at door there be one here who know that be english sit down again will tell how come to be here father be captain of english ship be wrecked on west coast be seized brought up here prisoner eight year ago mother who be daughter of late rajah of tripataly who married english lady taught to speak hindustani so that when got old enough must come out here try to find out if father be still alive if so to help to escape have only just come up here with friend who be officer of rajah when affair with tiger took place then a know tippoo made officer in palace of course while be here can hing towards finding out about father must not have remained here much longer anyway may have to leave at moment since met found that there be english girl captive here have of course changed plan feel must not go away leave to fate told of that if possible must take away with be of course if be willing to go with prepared to run certain amount of risk take on so continued a girl threw on knee clinging to burst into passion of tear cry like stooping down lifted placed in corner of divan there said patting on shoulder a sobbed almost convulsively try compose may be disturbed at moment may not have opportunity of talking again so must make arrangement in readiness to leave suddenly may find necessary to go at hour notice may a said be given by tippoo to one of favourite at time fortunately have gone away for fortnight so have at rate time before to make plan still be better that must arrange now a much a can chapter escape annie mansfield be not long before mastered emotion have learned to do so in bitter school beaten for slightest fault at mere caprice of one of many mistress have learned to suffer pain without tear to assume submissive attitude under greatest provocation to receive without attempting to defend punishment for fault have not committed to preserve appearance of cheerfulness when heart seemed breaking at hopelessness of deliverance from fate for last six month have be specially unhappy for when seringapatam have be besieged have hoped that when be captured countryman must search palace see that time english captive remained behind disappointment then when heard that peace have be made that english army be to march away without even attempt to see that condition for release of captive be faithfully carried out have for time completely crushed hope have forsaken thus then while have be for moment overwhelmed at finding that

who have for eight year be slave in tippoo harem will go with in disguise of boy ibrahim be getting for be going to buy couple of horse for will make straight down ghauts where will leave girl in

difficulty until come to crossing frontier sahib thank be too old now for fresh change have friend here have none below ghauts nothing save rescue of daughter from harem must induce to move now of there be little chance will by time have become reconciled to fate must probably not care to escape be opportunity offered to besides with only to protect what must do elsewhere few month might be left alone in world a to dick said must promise protection of aunt wife of rajah of tripataly after kindness that have shown to must be sure gladly take into service there must be difficulty about dowry for must see to that old man shook head there must be question of marriage said must ever hear from that be unhappy can arrange to fly with will assuredly avail myself of offer take to tripataly rejoiced indeed that at death there will be shelter open to now can aid in way sahib one of friend merchant must get horse for without difficulty have often occasion to buy for purpose of trade thank pertaub have intended to buy doubtless will be safer for somebody else to do so what be going to ask be to let know of place on other side of river where horse must be kept until want can do sahib have friend cultivator house stand by on side of first village one half mile beyond ford be only house side of village so can not mistake lie about hundred yard back from road will go over arrange with that when two horse arrive will be placed in stall remain there until one arrives who will say to after greeting word ' to be to deliver horse at once whether come by night day must do admirably pertaub of course will also want saddle bridle how much do think will come to altogether want showy horse must be animal capable of performing long journey of travelling at fair rate of speed faster better be likely to get seven eight hour start at least must of course travel fast a long a go well will keep main road if there be breakdown unforeseen accident occurs may have to leave road take to bypath cost of such horse must be about eighty rupee saddle bridle fifteen twenty then here be two hundred rupee pertaub have given up hope of finding father sahib have felt so sure that must be successful seemed to that such brave effort must not go unrewarded pertaub have not given up at intend to stay at tripataly for fortnight with mother will then come up ghauts again be matter want to

what must have done without assistance have be pleasure to to be of use to sahib have thought time of usefulness be over have given real pleasure to life to have be able to aid will let know sahib if

clothes dressed in fashion think be very happy when once got accustomed to lady made sort of pet of be taught to dance to sing little native song there be other white girl here be very kind to though always seemed very sad must not make out why cried so often especially when be beaten for cry a grew bigger be not so happy have ceased to be plaything little by little be set to work to sweep dust then to sew then to do sort of work like other slave girl other white girl gradually went away oldest first last two who be two three year older than be went about three year ago at first used to wonder why cried so when went why others cried too by time last two left have come to know about knew that have be given by sultan to favourite officer there be many white men here when first came when went out with one of slave into town saw often sometimes must burst into tear when saw then used to wonder why know now that must have reminded of girl of own whom must never see again then till three year ago there be about twenty white boy who have be taught to dance sing who used to come sometimes dressed up like woman to amuse lady of harem heard that be killed when sultan first thought that english might come here one of slave girl told that be done because sultan have often sworn to english that there be white captive here so did not wish that must be found if came think that have anything else to tell well hope that what have told will be enough to enable day to find out who belong to evidently be in place be besieged eight year ago have to surrender garrison be promised life liberty to depart be attacked at night by armed party who may have be horseman who be perhaps merely party of mounted robber who thought that might be able to take loot most likely be defeated especially a saw other captive in party in confusion of night attack one of probably came upon carried off thinking must be acceptable present here that must get reward for from sultan be not noticed when go into street on errand always go veiled except slave who be old ugly others wear veil when go outside palace wear red scarf show be servant in harem so even when town be full of rough soldier one venture to speak to now tell dick see have not forgotten about how came to be here dick told briefly how have come out with mother how finding war have broken out have joined army how at end of war having be able to learn nothing about father have come up with surajah to search for then saw that tiger break in girl said eagerly be dreadful will tell how be tiger came to seize be standing behind lady must not see anything suddenly began screaming ran to one side to other of window who must not think what be matter remained where be when there be great cry before have time to move even to wonder great thing knocked down be only from scream of lady cry of 'tiger knew what have happened felt something heavy standing on so heavy that must hardly breathe indeed did not try to breathe for knew many story of tiger have heard that sometimes when man sham being dead tiger will walk away kill someone else tiger be keeping up angry growl felt that unless took paw off must soon die when

of other slave girl who have be brave enough to look out of window told that have be killed by two young men one of whom must have be one who have fired shot in at window went looked out saw lying there after one talked laughed cried then sultan chief wife said that everyone must make present to young men who have saved that one ought to give one of best jewel of course everyone did have nothing to give except little cross of gold filigree work hung round neck when be carried off have be hidden by dress men have not noticed have not taken away when be brought here be such poor little gift be have noticed annie dick said there be little flat plate behind with letter m thought then that must be little ornament taken from one of englishwoman hyder troop killed be fortunate kept for may be useful someday in proving that be annie mansfield now must be going said be slapped pinched last time for being so long have several thing to get today so that if hurry can be back again a soon a expect have not settled when be going yet rather think of going day after tomorrow will be better to do so before tippoo come back for might be ordered away so quickly a to have time to make arrangement besides there will be ten time a many people about in palace more guard at entrance when return so altogether will be better to go before doe so if settle so will come along past door tomorrow evening if say 'tomorrow morning ' get here a soon a can in morning directly have stained skin put on disguise will start servant who be going with will act a guide will take to place where horse be where will join almost a soon a get there at appointed time next evening dick told annie that must start in morning surajah then went down said goodbye to pertaub dick gave letter to aunt to

hearty friend in father rajbullub surajah said be principal officer in rajah household will treat a brother daughter a if be sister then returned to palace where have final talk over route that must be best to pursue nearest point to new frontier be territory ceded to english on malabar coast must entail long sea voyage therefore determined to make for caveripatam going by road led through anicull then through ryacotta stood just outside line of territory ceded to england from whence road led direct down pass anicull lay nearly due south of bangalore road must follow must not be one by tippoo must return a must come by main road ran in direct line between two city ibrahim be informed of plan be told to warn syce to get horse saddled in readiness at eight o'clock that a be going for long day ride must not be required to accompany a always did when rode only into town for then might be wanted to hold horse if dismounted went into shop be also to give notice in kitchen that must not return to midday meal dish for must therefore not be required thus must be unlikely that suspicion must be aroused by absence until have be gone twenty four hour by time must be more than halfway to frontier went to bed at usual time slept soundly for seemed to that there be practically risk to be run that must be across frontier before active search be made for even when be discovered that have left palace must be thought that have received order from bangalore to join sultan to go on mission for have occupied more time than have anticipated on starting idea two officer who be considered to stand high in tippoo favour must desert must scarcely occur to anyone in morning be up early completed slight preparation took early breakfast reserving portion for annie who thought must not improbably have eaten nothing before coming to be quarter of hour late in arriving looked somewhat pale flurried did not send out morning said so have to stay until must slip out without being noticed may miss at moment will be right dick said confidently will search room in harem for first certainly wo look for outside until there have be lot of talk over absence even if do search will be able in few minute to walk through middle of without being suspected however will lose time to begin with will cut off what hair be necessary will do good deal quicker than must then will leave to yourself to stain skin put on disguise when have finished clap hand ibrahim will come in see that disguise be right that turban cover hair then will go with will be waiting near gate there be practically chance of being asked question if be there be difficulty will pas through right having seen on way will mount follow operation of cutting off annie hair to line of ear be speedily done then with few reassuring word dick joined surajah in corridor a walked down said like leaving to look here surajah go down to stable mount at once tell syce will come for horse in few minute then ride out take post where can see come out of gate then follow closely will stay here see safely through gate then mount follow will overtake before get to ford will perhaps be safest surajah agreed though must think there be chance of being suspected seeing that will be with ibrahim even if met one of palace officer asked ibrahim who have with must say be lad who have come to respecting horse have bought yes must do very well dick returned to ibrahim who be squatting down in corridor near door be going to follow until be through gate will keep short distance behind if must meet officer on way out who may ask who have with say have come with message to from trader in town by time have told that will be up there be chance of being questioned lord people come go day be so ibrahim one can not be too careful stood talking together until heard annie clap hand within ibrahim entered at once in two three minute came out again with girl ibrahim carried bundle will do very well dick said to annie must not know in least make capital boy what bundle be that ibrahim thought took other disguise on yesterday to stable where horse be yes lord took on be thing have taken off thought perhaps must be better not to leave here a if be found must be known that have gone with think make much difference ibrahim perhaps be a well to bring away can leave bundle in wood now go along will follow perhaps have better go first keep few pace behind passed through long passage of palace without attracting slightest attention once twice dick paused to speak to official of acquaintance others stopping respectfully few pace away then went out into courtyard across to gate a sentry saluted stopped asked few question a to regiment belonged to until ibrahim companion who have passed straight through be well away saw surajah sitting upon horse couple of hundred yard away then went to stable chapter journey syce brought out horse a soon a saw dick approaching need not wait up for after nine o'clock dick said a mounted be possible that may be detained will not return until tomorrow evening if come will certainly be back by nine at latest will not be back before seven at rate so that until then be free to do a like rode quietly off did not quicken pace until have got beyond fort then touched horse with heel cantered down to ford surajah be halfway across river when reached other two figure be just ascending road up other bank surajah checked horse when got across waited till dick joined will go on with to farmhouse asked may a well do so a halt in road besides there be thing ibrahim took over yesterday to put into saddlebag there be thing never thought of of course girl have never be on horse may give good deal of trouble wonder did not think of though if have see that anything else must have be done must see how get on if can not manage must take before whenever see that road be clear for good distance ahead of course doe not matter about country people if see body of troop coming in distance must mount own horse again follow at walk if find that thing go well must halt in wood somewhere ride only by night cantered on now overtook others just a reached farmhouse

against roll of blanket in front hold on a well a can with principal thing be for to balance with body sit up stiffly a if be in chair now will start at walk ibrahim will keep quite close to so a to be able to catch hold of rein must there be occasion for to do so then mounting surajah rode off at walk others following length two behind dick looked round from time to time saw that annie exhibited

first come up between surajah will take leading rein so that will have nothing to attend to holding on two cord have be attached to bridle before setting out surajah dick taking one started again horse instinctively breaking into canter be usual pace annie at first grasped strap of rug in front of a soon a became accustomed to motion let go small rug have be strapped over saddle before mounted afforded much better hold than must have have of leather a pace of horse be gentle one found much more easy to keep seat than have expected moreover fact that dick surajah rode close by side must be able to catch at once if swayed in saddle gave confidence be much better than thought must be said be quite pleasant motion will go faster if like there be occasion for dick replied be pace horse be most accustomed to will go on longer at than at other there be fear of pursuit have day before after quarter of mile riding came to wood must turn in here dick said be going treasure hunting hid casket be given by lady directly after got be going to dig up now take with rode at walk now till came to very large baobab tree growing by path be following here turn off there be man there surajah

still got order to governor of fort be likely enough that officer in charge may not be able to read very few of met before be able to do so sight of sultan seal at bottom be quite enough for must think must suffice to pas here still must look suspicious leaving country altogether must give explanation if ask might say that be charged with mission to english commander at kistnagherry might do surajah fort be only eight ten mile on other side of frontier might very well be sent on message complaint of of villager right have not be respected a agreed by treaty that have be robbed by men from side of frontier there be plenty of thing about tippoo might be sending message to kistnagherry worst of be that tippoo have not given mission do hate having to say what be not true surajah be not so particular replied well have given mission to visit hill fort a kistnagherry be hill fort be not very great stretch to include dick laughed be ingenious surajah anyhow see better excuse for crossing frontier so must make best of hope sha' be asked at think if say be going to kistnagherry then show tippoo order seal will be sufficient story will be quite true for will go by kistnagherry a road

skin into hollow of dick hand latter sprinkled girl face with have not fainted murmured opening eye turned giddy will be better directly drink little wine dick said surajah poured into cup with effort sat up pushed from there be nothing matter said only only burst suddenly into passion of sobbing spirit that have shown so long a there be danger have deserted now that peril have passed be safe dick looked at helplessly girl in tear be creature wholly beyond experience have idea what ought to do in emergency therefore adopted what be doubtless best course have known of letting alone after time violence of cry abated only short sob broke from a sat with face hidden in hand be right annie said putting hand on shoulder be quite natural for to cry after excitement fatigue have gone through have

than twenty mile today then will only be a much more down to tripataly tomorrow will walk for bit until get quite accustomed to seat after while horse broke into gentle canter for time annie felt very doubtful a to whether must retain seat so held tight with one arm to dick while with other hand kept firm hold of crupper presently however be able to release hold of latter be not long before be able honestly to assure dick that felt quite comfortable have fear of falling off in two hour passed near hill on stood fortress of kistnagherry have successfully resisted attack of english above now flew british flag skirting round foot came in course of hour half ride on to direct road have left at anicull in order to avoid passing through town of oussoor here came upon large village dick found

seeing that annie be growing very nervous a neared destination have ridden way by side of cart chatting cheerfully with why annie said look a solemn a if be just going into slavery instead of having escaped from be not that feel solemn dick be that everything be so new strange of course after saving life have never felt that be stranger a long a there be only surajah did not mind have felt quite at home with now that be going to new place where know anyone ca help feeling desolate will feel quite a much at home with in twenty four hour a have done with annie be tired now quite worn out with

mile of tripataly dick said now will ride on ahead annie prepare mother for coming will be pleasant to have question explanation when arrive be sure will carry straight off to bed keep there until have quite got over effect of journey did not wait to hear annie faint protest against leaving telling surajah to take place beside cart to keep talking to girl galloped on ahead sprang from horse in courtyard threw rein to servant ran in party have just sat down to evening meal a entered be greeted by exclamation of astonishment welcome mother have received two letter sent through pertaub by

palace there have be other girl in similar position have at about fourteen fifteen be given by tippoo to officer a must have be fate before long so determined to carry off with bring to until must find parent be very plucky girl although have never be on horse before rode way down until got side of kistnagherry a may imagine poor little thing be completely knocked up so brought down from there in cart be something mother to have saved one captive from tippoo grasp even though be not dear one be looking for promised that must be mother to until must restore to friend certainly will dick mr holland said warmly will tell girl gholla said to sister in law to have bed made up for in room will do so at once ranee said poor little thing must have have journey indeed will be here directly

afraid annie dick whispered a lifted down here be mother waiting to receive be young lady went on cheerfully a turned to mother promised warm welcome in name mr holland have already come down step a girl turned towards took in arm kissed in motherly fashion welcome indeed said will be mother to poor child till can hand over to own thank god for sending to will be comfort to to know that even if son must never bring husband back to have at least succeeded in rescuing one victim from tippoo in making one family happy girl clung to cry softly oh how good be sobbed seems too much happiness to be true be quite true dear come with will go up private stair will put straight to bed in room one else will see question until be quite recovered from fatigue be afraid annie began faintly did not need to say more mr holland interrupted dick must lift up carry into room poor child be utterly exhausted wonder couple of minute later dick returned to dining room have run down first to tell surajah to come up with found that have already gone to father apartment well dick rajah said a entered be prepared after hearing of tiger adventure of surajah being colonel in tippoo household for almost anything certainly never dreamt of returning here with english girl suppose not uncle such thing certainly never entered into calculation did not even know there be white girl in palace until one day stopped a be passing along corridor near harem to thank for saving life for be girl that tiger have struck down be standing upon when fired at of course have idea be english only said few word then for if have be seen talking to slave girl belonging to harem might have got into scrape however saw afterwards told about how be afraid that must be given away to one of tippoo officer of course must not leave to such fate a there be really difficulty in getting away be dressed a boy only have to ride with servant after have arranged so that absence must not be noticed until have be away for at least twenty four hour of course a officer of palace one questioned on journey so that be very simple affair altogether only difficulty there be rose from being completely tired out exhausted by journey a be utterly unaccustomed to travelling have to carry one night in front of on saddle for be scarce able to stand be not surprised at journey of hundred fifty mile to anyone who have never be on horseback must be terrible trial especially to young girl really wonder that did not break down altogether why can remember how stiff be first day two be here that after riding only hour two know uncle must not have be in least surprised if have collapsed talked over with surajah agreed that if must not go on must hire vehicle of sort let travel day in front of with ibrahim that if delayed so much that there be possibility of being overtaken must have put on peasant dress got rid of horse have gone forward on foot however kept up wonderfully well always made best of thing wo ask to tell anything more dick till mother join will have to go over story twice uncle can assure want to tell story until have have supper for meal have not be very comfortable on road have not eaten anything since early morning what be tippoo doing dick well a far a can see uncle be preparing for war again be strengthening fort building fresh defence to seringapatam drilling number of fresh troop english general made great mistake in not finishing with when be there ought to have taken city sent tippoo down prisoner to madras there tried for murder of score of englishman hung over rampart will have work to do over again in four five year however will not be such difficult business a be last time now that have pass in hand there be doubt uncle that considerable part of population will be heartily glad when tippoo power be at end see hyder be usurper have more right to throne than have quite so dick make letting off when must have taken capital easily more foolish if have be lawful ruler of mysore might not have be good policy to push too hard for must have have sympathy from native prince of india a being only son of adventurer who have deposed ill treated lawful ruler of mysore must seem to mere act of justice if english have dethroned punished provided of course put native prince on throne did not annex dominion have got to come day can see that in time english will be ruler of india at present be not strong enough to face general coalition of native state against very high handed action in mysore might well alarm native prince throughout india into laying aside quarrel with other combining in attempt to drive out just a have finished meal mr holland entered poor child be asleep said wanted to talk at first to tell how grateful be to dick of course insisted on being quiet said that must tell about in morning ate few mouthful of rice not long after lay down fell asleep have left sundra sitting there in case must wake up again think be likely that will do so now dick must tell about dick be not great hand at writing letter so have not entered with fullness into detail of what be doing principal point being to let mother know that be alive well before begin rajah said will send for rajbullub surajah master dick be rather fond of cutting story short must have surajah here to fill up detail surajah father soon appeared former be warmly greeted by rajah when have seated on divan dick proceeded to tell story be not interrupted until came to incident of killing of tiger here surajah be called upon to supplement story did doing full credit to quickness with dick have without moment loss of time cut netting ascended to window when dick came to incident of lady of harem presenting in tippoo presence with two casket mr holland broke in did not say anything about in letter dick let see casket where be be in one of saddlebag dick said be in room rajbullub corrected surajah brought up at once then have better get rajah said what do contain dick asked a surajah left room sort of thing necklace ring of be stone a if have be taken out of setting pertaub said have done because thought perhaps that tippoo must not allow jewel have worn to be sold worn by anyone else then must think that must be valuable ranee said pertaub said be worth good deal know whether really knew about cost of precious stone of thing be of small value being suppose trinket of slave girl gave something there be little cross there belonged to annie have initial on have on neck when be captured be thing valued most therefore gave suppose have anything else except usual trinket must wear when went out on special occasion with lady of harem thought must be useful to to prove who be surajah now returned with casket have better look at surajah first dick said know anything about look a if mine be more valuable wanted surajah to put together divide fairly must not son be perfectly right rajbullub said if have not be for young lord deed must never have be done at surajah aided in killing tiger be nothing more than have done on hill here be to merit be entirely due purse that sultan gave son be in ample reward for share took in now surajah open casket lady be waiting to see content whole of little packet fifty in number be opened examined many of eliciting exclamation of admiration from ranee mr holland there be doubt that many of be worth good deal of money rajah said be certain that tippoo treasury be full of spoil have carried off from state have overrun lady of harem doubt posse store of jewel must afford to be liberal to whom considered have saved life seven put together a best must alone be worth large sum must think that total value of whole can not be le than forty fifty thousand rupee so that if in casket be handsomer than dick must be valuable indeed dick casket be next examined of stone be magnificent dick three great diamond must only be valued by jeweller accustomed to such thing for value depends upon being of good lustre free from flaw according to judgment must say that at very least must be worth ten thousand rupee pearl necklace be worth at least a much ruby be superb must say lad that value of whole can not be le than fifteen thousand pound harem must be rich in jewel indeed to be able to make such gift not that be surprised at tippoo have jewel belonging to lawful ruler of mysore have captured of coorg travancore other state on malabar coast father have looted carnatic from cape comorin to north of madras have captured many of nizam city several mahratta province in fact have accumulated at spoil of whole of southern india of hindoo portion of own people value of jewel alone must be million of pound a a say dress simply only wear one two gem of immense value may well have bestowed large quantity upon harem especially a must be in fact only loan a at death of wearer must revert to indeed must be reclaimed at moment in freak of bad temper have doubt have to ask permission to give present a at moment be in high favour with daresay suffered to give what chose without inquiring at into value gold gave be simply to procure outfit left to harem to reward a chose for service have rendered well dick congratulate heartily place future beyond doubt leaf free to choose mode of life that may prefer congratulate too margaret on lad good fortune have well deserved by conduct see son here have proof of advantage of training cousin have have quickness coolness have acquired by enabled to make way down through fort at top of pas to defend ruined hut against fifty enemy now have enabled to seize opportunity opened by attack of tiger on tippoo harem thereby gaining sultan favour appointment to rank of colonel in mysore army post in palace magnificent collection of gem without quickness decision courage alone must have done little for in india have courage be because prince noble be brought up in indolence luxury that english though handful in point of number have become master of such wide territory surajah be a brave a dick must be first to tell that be to dick owes that on first excursion together escaped with life in last adventure attained rank position have returned with valuable gift be indeed lord surajah said young lord have be leader have tried to carry out order alone must never have got through gate in fort must no more have thought of going to assistance of lady of sultan harem than did other of thousand of men who be there looking on so see boy rajah went on though when came out here cousin be able neither to shoot to ride can shoot ride a well now a can ten of thousand of native have acquired from training in rough exercise quality of infinitely greater value than accomplishment do hope that example will stir up to take much greater interest than in spite of advice have hitherto done in active sport exercise grandmother be englishwoman want to see that with white blood in vein have of vigour energy of englishman be day before annie mansfield left room for first two have be completely prostrated after rapidly gained strength mr holland thought best to insist upon remaining perfectly quiet until have quite recovered ranee be constantly with so that when at end of week made first appearance at breakfast table be already at home with three of party before long shyness completely wore off seemed to have become really member of family mr holland have altered two of own dress to fit preferred for time to dress in indian costume to be accustomed be indeed much better suited to climate than more closely fitting european dress mr holland however bargained that must of evening wear frock have made for must get accustomed to dear so that when find own people will not be stiff awkward a certainly will be when dress in english fashion for first time day after arrival dick have written to military secretary of governor of madras with whom be well acquainted to tell that having gone up in disguise to seringapatam to endeavour to ascertain fate of father have discovered young english girl detained a slave in tippoo harem that have enabled to effect escape have placed in charge of mother then repeated account annie have given of capture asked if circumstance must be identified if officer of name of mansfield concerned in be still alive if so be still in india annie be secretly dreading arrival of answer after life a slave present existence seemed to so perfectly happy that shrank from idea of fresh change have memory whatever of parent have already very strong affection for mr holland liked ranee very much also absence of state ceremony in household of rajah be to delightful be already on good term with boy a to dick be always ready to go out with if must take to run message for to do anything in power indeed watched anxiously a if must discover forestall slightest wish one must think annie said one day that be still slave be master want to wait on child a waited on lady of harem however a will be going away in few day now doe not matter must grow a lazy a young rajah if be to go on long what will do when go away dick well hope that will set to work hard to learn to read write other thing mother will teach must not like when find own people to be regarded by girl of own age a ignorant little savage want to set to make up for lost time so that if be still here when come back will find have made wonderful progress oh do hope sha' be gone before dick be afraid must make up mind to annie for there be saying how long may be away next time see there be not much chance of lighting upon white slave girl having to bring down here will go in for long steady search for father want to find slave girl dick said earnestly not even if brought down here again must not like at why not annie oh might like ever so much better than must like to do sort of brave thing dick to save people a have saved must rather there be not girl dick laughed well suppose that there be much chance of besides ca turn uncle

peace be signed with tippoo three week afterwards commissioner be ordered to make special inquiry a to child to demand restoration reported that tippoo denied knowledge of affair of other girl there be ever given up letter went on there can be doubt that young lady rescued be child who be carried off initial speak of on cross may certainly be taken a proof of identity father retired from service last year with rank of colonel be of course ignorant of address a say that mr holland will gladly continue in charge of must suggest that must write letter to colonel mansfield stating circumstance of case saying that a soon a be informed of address young lady will be sent to england will enclose letter in one to board of director briefly stating circumstance requesting to forward enclosure to colonel mansfield to annie letter came a relief must be nearly year before letter must be received from father until then must be able to remain in new home chapter narrow escape mr holland undertook

followed by ibrahim who have begged so earnestly to be allowed to accompany that dick have consented to take feeling indeed that service must be most useful to two trooper rode off at sharp pace at amboor assumed disguise dick purchased pack pony good suitable to appearance a pedlers then started up pas on foot passed frontier line without interruption stopped chatted for few minute with guard then passed on up valley there be house where have fight surajah dick said a reached ruined village though there be peace now fancy must not get much farther than fort ahead if guessed that be fellow who gave such trouble two year half ago there be fear of being recognised surajah said guard have probably be changed long ago besides never once caught sight of face oh be safe enough dick agreed if have not be sure of must have gone up one of pass to south have be ceded to though must have be great deal longer round to bangalore unless indeed have gone by kistnagherry must have be too dangerous to attempt for officer on frontier must probably have recognised be late in afternoon before arrived at gate stood open there be sentry on duty few soldier must be seen loitering about in street be evident that now war be over everything finally settled be considered that occasion for vigilance be at end upon making inquiry soon found house where must put up for night have a be custom in india brought provision with after leaving good in house seeing that horse be fed ibrahim set to work to cook meal while others opened one of pack went round village where disposed of few small article arrived without adventure at bangalore there a soon a have established at one of caravansary for traveller dick surajah went to house of trader to whom pertaub have promised to consign good have come for pack have be sent by friend of ours at seringapatam to care dick said making a spoke sign pertaub have taught a enabling who be hindoo to recognise other at once be to use word ' a sign that be party to whom be consigned good arrived week ago trader said be lying for at warehouse will hand over to tomorrow morning thank may not come early for have to purchase two pack horse to carry three tat for ourselves man may take time will be perhaps better for to come to early next morning can then start away direct be arranged on following day two strong animal be bought for pack three tat pony for own riding dick have disposed of horse have ridden down to tripataly for good price have also be supplied with fund by mother although a said content of pack ought to suffice to pay expense for long time then purchased provision for journey pack horse have brought with be laden with good brought up from amboor new pack horse be taken round to trader good sent from seringapatam packed on then mounted rode off at walk pack animal following ibrahim horse tied one behind other have already debated upon course to pursue finally decided that must in first place again visit savandroog for conviction dick have entertained that there be at least one white captive there have increased rather than diminished ca give good reason for surajah have admitted when talked over before starting be just because have good reason to give want to go there again why must have strong conviction without good cause one have heard of presentiment of evil ca help feeling that be presentiment of good question be how can best go there again think be in least likely that governor will have heard of flight a must be last direction anyone must think of taking for have done so might have met sultan on way back from bangalore will naturally be supposed that have made for frontier have descended western southern ghauts affair will of course seem mystery to altogether for why must two young fellow so recently promoted in such high favour desert tippoo service if associate annie disappearance with flight there be reason on earth why must do so a one ever saw speaking to will most likely think that have fallen into hand of dacoit thug have be murdered number of people do disappear year be a everyone supposes victim of detestable sect uncle have told of thug warned to be very careful if travelled with stranger for that men travel in sort of disguise so think that a far a go must boldly put on uniform badge again ride into disadvantage of doing so be however plain commander must remain with time must get opportunity of speaking privately with of soldier taking to be in tippoo confidence must a before shirk question of prisoner on other hand if can get in a trader will be able to move about unwatched to go to soldier hut offer good to wife be able to find out to certainty if there be prisoner there if so where be kept may even see for while if governor wished to keep existence secret must have shut up when heard that two of tippoo officer be coming must not trouble about one way other in case of couple of trader only objection to course be that be here two three month since servant artillery officer went round with must know at once if go will have to alter appearance completely at rate have better provide mean for disguise can use not a please while be at tripataly therefore have two false beard made for tried many experiment in way of painting face found that by tracing light line on forehead at corner of eye be able by help of beard to counterfeit appearance of old age so well that must only be detected on close observation dick too have purchased pair of native spectacle with large round glass broad black horn rim made look a said like astonished owl be agreed that surajah must wear under dress very thickly padded vest must give appearance of being fat a well a elderly proceeded for seven eight mile at walking pace when heat of day rendered necessary for to stop turned into grove by roadside a have intention of going on to savandroog day intending to halt mile short of to present there next afternoon therefore prepared for stay of hour pack horse be unloaded saddle taken off other animal hour later party of twelve men travelling in same direction a also halted turned in among tree man who be apparently leader of party came across to where be sitting disturb hope brother said grove be large enough for see that be trader like by mean surajah replied wood be open to even be not must be discourteous indeed did refuse to share shade with others sit down by beg of while people be unloading animal marked a left bangalore trader said a seated beside when saw that be taking same route that must follow wondered how far road might lie together be travelling west surajah replied may be that will stop at magree there at outradroog stop for day two to trade thence may go north then a far a outradroog path will lie together merchant said there will strike river turn south to seringapatam be sorry that will not be going farther in direction for road be far from safe since war with feringhees ended there be many disbanded soldier who have taken to dacoity be always better to travel with strong band wonder that venture with three loaded animal only one man beside yourselves surajah be about to speak quick glance from dick stopped think there be le danger in travelling in small body than there be with large one latter said there be le to tempt anyone to interfere with moreover must not travel with caravan because greater part of good be such a must tempt peasantry only therefore stop at small village to trade leaving town to who travel with more valuable merchandise after chatting for minute traveller got up joined party much like fellow look dick said when be alone why look very respectable man oh yes look respectable enough for fancy may be that regard a rival be only trying to find out where intended to stop whether be likely to spoil trade be why said what did so that might perceive that be not likely to interfere with then again surajah remembered uncle warning against joining other traveller a thug who say commit so many murder generally travel in band disguised sometimes a trader sometimes a men seeking work sometimes a disbanded soldier anyhow be a well to be careful have got brace of double barrelled pistol in girdle in addition to old single barrelled indian one that carry for show sword be leaning against tree behind so can get hold of in moment know of course that betting be in favour of people being peaceful trader want to leave anything to chance there be nothing like being prepared for may happen presently dick got up sauntered across to ibrahim who be engaged in cooking ibrahim said look round while speak to go on with cooking like look of leader of party may be respectable trader may be dacoit thug want to keep sharp lookout without seeming to do so see that pistol will come out of girdle easily keep sword handy for use if see anything suspicious come over tell if there be not time for shout will watch sahib ibrahim said seem to peaceable men like ourselves of course carry weapon one must travel about with merchandise without doing so may be right ibrahim have sort of feeling that be not at rate be best to be cautious other party did not light fire sat down ate provision carried with when surajah dick have finished meal leader again strolled over to asked whether intended to sleep on hearing that did not again sat down with proceeded to discus trading matter to describe good carried place where have purchased price have given a talked dick noticed that three four of others came across did not sit down stood round listening to conversation sometimes joining in dick feeling of uneasiness increased thrusting one hand carelessly into girdle grasped butt of one of hidden pistol suddenly loud cry came from ibrahim at same moment something passed before dick face threw backwards drawing pistol a did so fired into body of man behind second later shot who be in act of throwing twisted handkerchief round surajah neck then leapt to foot delivering a did so heavy blow with barrel of pistol on head of trader who have be sitting between surajah have passed in few second other men started back in surprise at unexpected failure of plan surajah be on foot almost a quickly a dick even yet did not understand what have happened at moment there be crack of pistol then ibrahim came running towards having shot man who have suddenly drawn sword tried to cut down at heel came six men who have up to point be standing in group near horse without hesitation dick drew out one of single barrelled pistol shot pretended trader whose turban have saved from effect of blow who shouting loudly to companion be struggling to foot remaining eight men have drawn sword be rushing upon fire surajah dick shouted be asleep man surajah be not asleep be confused by suddenness of fray be still doubtful whether dick have not made entirely unprovoked attack upon stranger however perceived that be now too late to discus point be question of fighting for life accordingly fired barrel of one of pistol one of men dropped sword surajah dick exclaimed a grasped scabbard of own weapon in left hand while in right held other double barrelled pistol antagonist with yell of fury be now upon dick shot one next man aimed at darted suddenly aside when fired dick dropped pistol grasped hilt of sword just in time to ward off blow aimed at head blow after blow be showered upon so quickly that must do more than ward off wait opportunity heard surajah fire two more shot in quick succession then ibrahim suddenly dashed forward cut down opponent then furiously engaged who be on point of attacking from behind dick drew remaining pistol shot man through head have then time to look round surajah shot have told be now defending against assault of two others who be pressing hard while third stood irresolute short distance away dick rushed to surajah assistance a did so third man fled after ibrahim dick shouted not one of must get away two thug defended with cry of fanatical fury opponent be far better swordsman fighting coolly be not long before cut down what on earth be about dick surajah asked a panting with exertion looked round after cutting down opponent thug dick said briefly be sure dick surajah asked presently may be terrible business for if there be mistake for answer dick pointed to body of two men have first shot one still grasped roomal twisted silk sash while like deadly implement lay by side of other thank heaven surajah ejaculated be afraid there might have be mistake dick see that be right that be party of thug if have not be that be on watch for have pistol ready must have lost life be close shave a be surajah one second later must have be strangled have hand on pistol felt so sure that attack be intended that moment something passed before face although have idea what be threw back fired at man behind with instinctive feeling that life depended on speed be only when on looking at saw man in act of throwing noose round neck that knew exactly what have escaped be fortunate that have not pistol surajah said must have have chance against if have have firearm must have shot moment first fired uncle said when be talking to one day that have heard that strangler did not carry firearm because report might attract attention that be matter of religion with to kill victim by strangling that if strangler failed very seldom did other men must then despatch victim with sword knife ah here come ibrahim caught just outside tree sahib will strangle more traveller well what have better do asked surajah must say have better make off a fast a can of course if be really trader able to prove who be must go back to town report affair a ca do that have better be moving on at once before other party of traveller come up be why when have killed several of be anxious that none must get away for might have gone accused of slaughtering companion must be too unlikely story to be believed one must credit three men must attack twelve there must be one to prove that there be only three fellow must naturally swear that there be score of that after murdering companion rest made off with booty ibrahim load pack animal at once will saddle horse think surajah have better leave everything just a be be now getting on for afternoon be likely enough that other traveller will enter grove today by tomorrow at latest someone will come in will of course go report at once in bangalore what have found will send out here to examine into when find that men have fallen sword in hand that two of be evidently strangler girdle have not be searched pack on horse opened will be seen that be not work of robber suppose will know what to make of must think must most likely conclude that men have be attacked by other party that be matter of feud private revenge though even then fact that body have not be searched for valuable baggage animal carried off will beat altogether by time horse be ready for start after looking up down long straight road to see that one be in sight issued from wood continued journey being anxious now to get away a far a possible from scene of struggle instead of going on to magree a have intended turned off by first country road on left hand side made for savandroog must see towering up above plain when within three mile of halted in large wood here a soon a horse have be unsaddled fire lighted talk naturally turned to fight have gone through can not make out how came to suspect dick can hardly account for a told did not like look of man have uneasy sort of feeling must not explain even to myself that there be danger in air what made think of strangler have heard talk about never anything for certain rajah told when be warning against joining party of traveller although very little be known about organisation be certain that there be sect who strangled robbed traveller in great number said that be aware that complaint have be made to prince over india of number of person being missing that be certain that murder be not work of ordinary dacoit of secret association that even powerful prince be afraid to take step against a one two who have made effort to investigate affair have be found strangled in bed therefore one cared to take step to search into matter be not known whether strangler scattered a be very widely obeyed one common chief whether acted separately be glad to leave mysterious organisation alone especially a preyed only on traveller in case meddled in way with rajah official who did not interfere with consequently idea occurred to directly that men who seemed like trader might be party of strangler when others came up while leader be sitting talking to felt a if cold water be running down back that someone be whispering to 'be on guard be on guard ' therefore moment something passed before face threw back fired at man behind without moment thought a to what be well certainly saved life by doing so dick for suppose if man behind have once got silk scarf round neck must have choked before have time to so much a lift hand have not least doubt that must feel thankful indeed have strange feeling that men be dangerous do know surajah seems to that be just same sort of feeling that mother tell have whenever father be in danger will be curious to know when get back whether have same feeling about anyhow will in future have even more faith than have before in confidence that must have certainly known if evil have happened to father chapter found at last next morning early dick surajah set to work to perfect disguise have before appeared simply a two young trader well to do of class above ordinary peddling merchant now fitted on ample beard have be made at tripataly be attached so firmly to face by adhesive wax that must not be pulled off without use of good deal of force with same stuff small patch of hair be fastened on so a to hide edge of foundation of beard tuft of short grey hair be attached to eyebrow few grey line be carefully drawn at corner of eye across forehead when be done felt assured that one be likely to suspect disguise ibrahim who have assisted in operation declared that must take for men of sixty five a before beginning of have darkened face several shade felt confident that one at fort be likely to recognise when surajah have put on padded undergarment converted into portly looking old man dick great horn spectacle indulged in burst of laughter at changed appearance while ibrahim fairly shouted with amusement be to stay behind in wood when went on for must have added to risk have accompanied a unless also completely disguised must have be recognised by soldier with whom have talked during twenty four hour stay inside tower wall be in evening to proceed along road to

trust only to hand father a sailor will be able to put up to best way to do at rate might let down first think that by twisting rope two three time round body then holding between knee foot might

agreed will do up brace of pistol in packet put with note dick went on will say in that hope will accept a token of esteem gratitude be well finished english pistol have doubt will prize will mention too that will have made escape at eleven o'clock therefore by time receives letter will be far beyond reach of pursuit daresay will decide upon letting matter pas quietly will see that by making fuss over one outside fortress will ever know that prisoner have escaped next day passed comparatively quietly good many soldier woman came up from below before sunset good be completely cleared out

will prevent possibility of thing slipping up over shoulder will take lot of strain off chest then lay down crawled forward to edge pegged cushion down then turning to surajah said be ready now surajah have felt rather ashamed that precaution must be taken for while others must have to rely solely upon hand foot sternly repressing sign of nervousness stepped forward to side of captain holland be right captain said approvingly now lie down by side work backwards go over on one side of cushion for might otherwise displace will hold wrist let over dick will hold rope will put fairly on cushion then will take stand close to edge pay out gradually a go down if must find projecting piece of rock call out betop will hold on at once can then talk over how can best avoid difficulty

indeed to nothing a be already at war with england french be extremely glad to embrace proposal of tippoo a overrated power believed that must prove formidable opponent to english must necessitate employment of additional troop ship there so weaken england power at home to confirm alliance sixty seventy frenchman mostly adventurer be sent from mauritius a civil military officer tippoo council have be strongly opposed to step on part have pointed out to that alliance with power at war with english must render war between english inevitable france be not in position to aid in way only

france a have received letter from official personage there encouraging to combine with other native power to drive english out of india promising large aid in troop ship when earl of mornington afterwards marquis of wellesley arrived at calcutta a governor general of india in may situation have become so critical that although war have not be absolutely declared on side tippoo open alliance

shot being fired while nizam be thus rendered powerless negotiation have be going on with mahratti owing to quarrel jealousy of chief nothing must be done with be however apparent that for same reason tippoo must equally fail in attempt to obtain alliance against that therefore be with mysore alone that must have to deal in meantime though preparing for war lord mornington be most anxious to avoid when tippoo wrote to complain that village of have be occupied by people from coorg governor general ordered immediate restoration to in november sent sultan friendly letter pointing out that must look for efficient aid from france that auxiliary who might possibly join must only introduce principle of anarchy hatred of religion animated whole french nation that alliance with be really
