obliged to do so before long a farm must carry small number more than already possessed available extent for purpose must diminish year a planting went on mr humphreys be fortunate in having small stream run through farm erected dam across hollow so that in winter pond of two three acre in extent fifteen sixteen foot deep be formed affording ample supply for summer be of great utility to a be thereby enabled to continue planting operation filling up hole with water when tree be put in then a subsided filling in earth by mean young tree got good start seldom required watering afterwards

often massacred altogether abominable state of thing prevails there seems to be one opinion throughout colony that be absolutely necessary for safety that zulu organisation will be broken up see mr jackson said that there be advertisement in paper for waggon for transport of store price offered be excellent large number be required be thinking of sending down two team what do think have be turning over in mind mr humphreys replied be inclined also to offer waggon rate of pay be a say high certainly will have difficulty in obtaining number require will not have need for mine for home

felt time hang heavy on hand must have liked to take gun go out to shoot game for dinner shooting have be strictly forbidden a sound of gun might cause false alarm after hanging about camp for hour two dick proposed that must climb hill rose so steeply behind if column have fighting said must be sure to see from top borrowing telescope from one of officer of volunteer cavalry skirted round to back of hill there began climb be very steep after hard work reached summit then crossed to front sat down in comfortable niche in rock whence must command view far down valley must see two battalion of infantry marching steadily along cavalry moving among hill undulation on flank have taken biscuit bottle of beer up with spent whole day on look out view gained be very extensive one a hill be far higher than on side in many place must see small body of enemy moving about at sunset descended vote go up again tom said next morning general have gone forward with most of white troop there be sure to be fighting to day will have nothing to do may a well go up there a anywhere else after general departure there remained in camp five company of st battalion of th one of nd battalion two field piece with artillery men mounted men just a boy be starting at eight in morning there be report in camp that zulu be gathering in force to north of camp quickened boy movement hour later gained top of

be going to be fight dick exclaimed a gained look out there be crowd of zulu out there on plain must boy have looked over hill mile away to right must have seen that number of zulu down in valley in front be small proportion of gathering for attack for men have moved up during night be lying quietly behind hill more be taking road to rorke drift to cut off who might escape from camp while a many more be showing down valley altogether of enemy have gathered round little body in camp to boy however only party down valley be visible at eleven o'clock colonel durnford came into camp with mounted men from rorke drift advanced with to meet enemy threatening left flank while two company of st battalion of th moved out to attack right zulu now reinforced from behind hill moved forward steadily colonel durnford with cavalry must do little to arrest for hour infantry stood ground two field piece swept line through thick rank of enemy zulu advanced in form of great crescent thing look very bad dick tom said what do think have better do think have better stay where be tom wait see what occurs have splendid view of fight if fellow meet will see if oh look there tom over hill on left thousand of zulu be seen pouring down be terrible tom look here will crawl along over crest so a not to be seen look behind to see if be clear there if be vote make bolt be of use thinking of going down for couple of horse zulu will be in camp long before must get there five minute later again joined friend be coming up behind too tom have really surrounded look be close to camp be scene of frightful confusion nothing must be seen of company of th have gone out to meet zulu great wave of advancing army have swept over below panic be complete terrible soldier native driver camp follower be running wildly in direction one party of th men about sixty strong have gathered together stood like little island incessant fire of rifle covered with white smoke while dense mass of zulu pressed upon many of soldier be flying for life others again when found that retreat be cut off have gathered in group be fighting desperately to last here there mounted men strove to cut way through zulu while number of fugitive must be seen making for river hotly pursued by crowd of enemy who speared a ran be frightful frightful tom can not bear to look at for few minute fight continued crack of rifle be heard le frequently now exulting yell of zulu rose louder louder on right colonel durnford with cavalry essayed to make one last stand to check pursuit of zulu give time for fugitive to escape be in vain shower of assagai fell among zulu crowd surged round for time boy thought be lost few horseman cut way through crowd rode for river artillery have long before ceased to fire gunner lay speared by cannon first shot have be fired at half past eleven by one o'clock be over last white man have fallen zulu swarmed like vast body of ant over camp in search of plunder horror stricken sick boy shrank back against rock behind for time sobbed bitterly over dreadful massacre have taken place before eye after time began to talk more quietly will come up here do think dick think so dick replied must hardly have seen come up here even if have be on look out on hill a reached back of mountain before camp be taken will know that nobody must have come up afterwards lie back here can not possibly be seen from below will be too much taken up with plundering camp to think of searching hill what on earth be general doing can see troop right away on plain surely must have heard gun only hope now be that when hears will march straight back even if doe fear that zulu will be too strong for whole force have with be stronger than have be crushed here expect native regiment can make much stand if attacked by such tremendously strong force so long a daylight lasted boy peering occasionally over must see zulu at work of plundering sack barrel be taken from waggon cut broken open man taking a much a must carry of tea sugar flour other necessary many of yoke ox be assegaied at once cut up eaten rest being driven off towards north by party of warrior at tent be set on fire soon burnt out boy must no longer see what be taking place rising from shelter walked back to other side of crest can hear firing now dick said seems to that be back at rorke drift be soon sure that be not mistaken a grew darker flittering light be seen in direction continued fire of distant musketry be heard later on there be broad glare in sky fear be over there too dick said that place have be burnt still however firing continued a heavy a ever long on into night lad sat listening to at last fell asleep when awoke sun be already high thus missed chance of escape at nine o'clock in evening lord chelmsford force hearing at last what have happened marched back into camp before day have fairly broken continued way down to rorke drift defender here little garrison under lieutenant bromhead of th chard of royal artillery have made heroic defence against of enemy with mealy bag box built up breastwork held night in spite of desperate effort of zulu to capture hospital stood at one end of intrenchment be carried burnt by zulu little garrison held out till morning in inner intrenchment round store house here be seen what must be done in way of defence by aid of hastily thrown up intrenchment have breastwork be erected at isandula a ought to have be instant troop arrived there still more so when major portion of column marched away force there small a be must doubtless have made successful resistance even have step be taken when zulu be first seen approaching of forming laager be of drawing up waggon in form of hollow square at foot of steep mountain disaster might have be averted may be said that massacre of isandula be due entirely to over confidence carelessness of officer in command of column boy on waking crawled back cautiously to spot where must obtain view over valley to surprise force on afternoon before have seen out there have entirely disappeared many body of zulu be seen moving about there be trace of white troop made way to back of hill then to horror saw column moving away from already half way on road to rorke drift first impulse be to get up start off in run in pursuit of feeling lasted moment for between hill column many scattered party of zulu be to be seen boy looked blankly at other be too clear that be cut off alone in enemy country will do dick have not least idea tom at rate there be nothing to be done at present must be assegaied in moment if be to go down let go back to old look out after much talk agreed that must be hopeless to attempt to make south cross buffalo a many of fugitive have done there be sure to be strong body of zulu along river even if passed without detection must be unable to cross river a must find ford of be able to swim there be great number of zulu in camp below seemed to be pursuing work of plundering more minutely than have done on previous day store scattered recklessly about be collected placed in empty barrel loaded up on waggon presently number of cattle be brought down be harnessed to waggon driven off by nightfall nothing save scattered remnant marked place where british camp have stood from post boy must see that ground far near be dotted with corps black white after boy descended to camp having marked exact spot where waggon have stood be able to collect number of piece of broken biscuit scattered about be fortunate enough to light upon water bottle still full with treasure returned to post on mountain have agreed to wait there for three four day in fact a long a must hold out then quietly to walk into one of native kraal if caught in act of flight be certain of being killed hoped that when zulu blood have cooled down after conflict life might possibly be spared plan be carried out for four day remained on hill of isandula then descending late one evening to plain walked for ten twelve mile north waiting until daybreak showed large native kraal at great distance made for sat quietly down at door of principal hut presently girl issued from neighbouring hut upon seeing gave scream ran back again cry brought others to door of hut when boy be seen perfect hubbub of tongue broke forth many of men running out with spear advanced towards lad

buller men in wild broken country a troop advanced came here there across body of zulu showing that buller have have to fight way captain ronald campbell ascended rock scanned country with glass far away almost in centre of gigantic apparently inaccessible cliff of zlobani remains of buller column must be seen slowly advancing driving dark mass of cattle zulu before colonel wetherby obtained permission to lead men on at once to buller assistance while colonel wood followed with remainder of force wetherby moved by terribly difficult path to right while wood kept to what seemed main track about mile further latter came on party of zulu armed with rifle crossed in front of taking occasional shot at leading file of party who on account of difficulty of road be compelled to dismount lead horse object be evidently to cut off wetherby troop from main column lieutenant lysons leaving column reconnoitred ground found that wetherby party be already divided from by deep impassable ravine at bottom of be pathway by buller have made way to summit of cliff strong party of zulu be seen faraway in front working a if to cut off buller horse be clear that there be nothing to do to press forward in hope that line taken by wetherby main column be following must come together at moment heavy fire be opened by party of enemy from narrow ledge of rock hundred yard above untongo two of men guided party of eight marksman to still higher point fire speedily drove off zulu hour march brought wood upon wetherby track high above to right rear of buller column must be seen more unsuitable ground for operation of mounted men must be found perpendicular rock rose in direction while steep precipice fell away at foot killed wounded horse be seen at turn of road showing how stoutly enemy have held ground how difficult operation buller have performed sending fifty men to work upon right flank endeavour to take zulu in rear colonel wood kept men for few moment under cover of friendly ledge of rock to take breath look to rifle girth ammunition then pressed rapidly forward joined border horse scene be now most exciting firing be almost continuous yell of savage rose from rock bush mingled with loud cheer of buller men far up in front a saw column approaching to aid ground be now more level practicable for riding colonel wood mounted horse accompanied by own little escort of dozen men border horse under colonel wetherby with gallant boy aged fifteen who be fighting by side galloped forward for front leaving colonel russell in command of column when within hundred pace of summit of

horse making way with great difficulty across broken ground reached point where must see plain there in five continuous column zulu army from ulundi strong be sweeping along at usual rapid pace be evident at once that only by speedy retreat must of force hope to escape colonel wood despatched message at once to colonel russell who have with force by time commenced ascent at extreme westerly point to retrace step instantly to cover a far a possible retreat of native ally with cattle colonel buller above have also seen coming danger so far have accomplished work admirably zulu position have be triumphantly stormed large number of cattle taken driven off have colonel wood force wetherby troop arrived on scene of action immediately after buller have ascended to plateau retreat must have be made in time expedition must have be successful at point unfortunate incident of losing track delay caused thereby inability to rejoin have given time for ulundi army to come up colonel buller found that be impossible now to descend to plain by path by have ascended not only must have to fight way back through whole force of umbelleni retreat by route must be cut off by ulundi men consequently pursued by great body of exulting zulu made way along plateau to steep path at extremity scene here be terrible zulu blocked way in front lined side buller with piet uys defended rear

to gallop off join column appeared to be making way through zulu colonel russell command got through without so much opposition buller horse piet uys troop wetherby command suffered terribly fortunately ulundi army did not follow retreat first because tremendous three day march have made have in great measure exhausted men who have started in such haste that have brought provision with secondly on account of steady attitude resolute bearing of russell command buller force reached kambula camp at half past seven at night have set in stormy torrent of rain be falling although have be

duty being without arm thought that might a well make useful at work therefore taking stretcher proceeded to one of outer shelter trench be nearly eleven o'clock when zulu be seen approaching halted just out of musket range here apparently council of war be held be more than hour before forward movement be made then body of about strong ran at tremendous pace along ledge situated at edge of cultivated land troop be ordered not to fire a be thought better to wait until zulu came on in earnest at past one cloud of skirmisher advanced from zulu army fed by support began to scale north front of english position here behind outermost line of intrenchment of buller russell dismounted men portion of band of gallant piet uys be stationed opened fire upon zulu scarcely one of be dead shot sooner did head shield appear above rock boulder tuft of grass than deadly rifle rang out in most case there be enemy le to encounter boer particularly distinguished at work most of men be certain shot being trained from childhood in use of large single barrelled gun carrying enormous bullet suited for destruction of big game animated by hatred of zulu longing for vengeance for death of late leader boer picked off foe with unerring aim enemy skirmisher now retired more solid line took place supported by dense column in rear cavalry remounted fell slowly back major russell with twenty of men made brilliant charge on party of zulu who be running to take possession of sheltering ledge of rock after cutting down great many retreated without loss of man buller russell now retired slowly within laager retreat being covered by colonel gilbert four company of th who be posted at face of work one company of th under captain cox held cattle laager be situated outside line so be able to

upon company commanded by captain woodgate be stationed half way between laager upper fort keeping open communication between enemy fire from height commanding line being particularly galling two of tremlett gun be brought to bear on point enemy fire speedily slackened for hour half troop continued to be hotly engaged for enemy when driven back from one flank swept round in most perfect order attacked at past four zulu concentrating again attacked northern side made desperate rush up to muzzle of english rifle fighting for time be almost hand to hand boy have worked round with stretcher wherever fire be hardest have carried many wounded men into hospital be at north face when zulu swarmed up towards woodgate men fell back into shelter of laager a came in young lieutenant who be

brought to bear upon a disheartened beaten fell back buller russell with mounted man in camp sallied out fell upon burning with desire to wipe out misfortune of preceding day chased for seven mile like flock of sheep cutting down immense number be ascertained afterwards from prisoner that zulu force attacked be composed of men be commanded by tyangwaiyo with umbelleni a second many of leading chief of zululand of king bravest best troop fell in attack on kambula battle be by far hottest best contested took place during war upon side two officer twenty one men be killed difference between result of action at kambula at isandula be due entirely to fact that in one case precaution be taken mean of defence utilised while in other more attention be paid to of point than if troop have be encamped at aldershot upon day following battle colonel wood set men to work to erect further defence at point recent action have shown to be weak never ceased work until place have be made almost impregnable against assault of savage however brave messenger who carried to natal news of victory of kambula also took letter from boy to parent acquainting of safety with first convoy of wounded on following day boy started for home colonel wood having given to flattering testimonial a to gallant conduct in action having presented with two horse belonging to men of buller corp who have fallen in

warm greeting be over dick learned that mother have be seriously ill be now recovering that father have be much shaken dick told harrison to go to house under excuse of question about work to call mr humphreys out to tell of return leaving to to break news to wife mr humphreys after recovering from own emotion at joyful intelligence did so gradually quietly that tale produced injurious effect upon mother began by saying that have heard that rumour be afloat that of be supposed to have be killed at isandula have be kept captive by zulu mr humphreys for time doubted news upon husband assurance that intelligence be well founded faint feeling of hope began to spring up then gradually step by step told that be reported that captive consisted chiefly of non combatant men who have taken refuge among rock bush when fight be seen to be going against troop still further raised mr humphreys hope for from presence of mind shrewdness dick have shown on occasion of snow storm seemed probable that must be quick to avail of chance of escape there might be then mr humphreys said that report affirmed that among prisoner be two three quite young lad so step by step went on until delighted mother learned that son be already upon farm be only waiting until knew must be strong enough to see mr humphreys now went to door gave loud shout dick who have be waiting signal agreed on at short distance

government have not promptly paid for loss there must have got more waggon from farmer for work have already four more building for at newcastle suppose there be great fright in colony after defeat terrible mr humphreys answered everyone imagined that zulu must at once cross frontier carry fire sword throughout colony rest of th regiment instantly went forward to colonel glyn column restored to something like strength before fight river be high may have accounted partly for zulu not taking offensive probably too great loss must have suffered have effect while might not have liked to have

place inhabited principally by english trader shopkeeper here three road branched one led to utrecht on east to pretoria capital to north west while third track much le used than others led due north be one followed by caravan a proceeded dutch farmhouse became more sparsely sprinkled over country several large native kraal be passed over wide plain large herd of deer roamed almost unmolested lad have difficulty in keeping caravan well supplied with provision one two of kaffir generally accompanied to carry in game mr harvey three hunter accustomed to more exciting sport kept along with caravan former well content that lad must amuse with furnishing food for party at newcastle mr humphreys have purchased couple of small pocket compass one for of boy possession of gave great confidence a with guidance be always enabled to strike trail of caravan road have now altogether ceased be travelling across bare undulating country dotted occasionally by herd flock of dutch settler by herd of wandering deer unbroken by tree of size for most part covered with tall grass deer met with be for most part antelope of one other of three kind of abound on higher plain be known a wilde beest bless buck spring buck venison creature afforded be occasionally varied by flesh of stump pig abounded in considerable number a ran at great speed afforded boy many good chase generally caravan halted for night while be still in country occupied here there by boer near one of farmhouse be not that habitation added to pleasure of halting place for boer be generally gruff surly dog annoyed by constant barking growling for most part be only at farmhouse water must be obtained small sum be generally charged by boer for privilege of watering ox of waggon must seem churlish action to charge for water fluid be very scarce upon veldt there be long period of drought of in dry season thousand of cattle perish be therefore only natural that farmer must hoard supply jealously for can not tell how great own need of may shortly be water be for most part stored in artificial pond made by damming up hollow through water run in wet season sometimes a caravan made slow way along young boer must dash up upon horse reining in ask few question a to route then ride off again already boy have admired figure riding of boer whom have seen in action in zululand be much more struck by appearance a saw now there be finer men in world than young boer of transvaal in after life often become heavy a young men figure be perfect very tall powerfully built sit horse a if man animal be one be such

son daughter be most unlimited be hardest cruellest of master to unfortunate native whom keep in slavery under title of indentured apprentice whose life regard a of more importance than of sheep a of infinitely le consequence than of horse even of dog to unhappy native taking over of transvaal by england have be blessing of highest kind for first time shooting of in cold blood have come to be considered crime ordinance have be issued against slavery although generally evaded by boer still promised happy state of thing in future at native kraal traveller be always welcomed when be known that be english native looked to queen victoria a sort of guardian angel not thought entered head that must ere long be cruelly basely abandoned to mercy of dutch by government of england slowly without incident caravan made way north at last encamped upon bank of great river limpopo northern boundary of transvaal river be too wide deep to be forded at spot where have struck there be large native kraal here mr harvey who have many time before followed same route to spot be warmly welcomed preparation be made for effecting crossing ox be first taken across be steered by rope attached to horn fastened to canoe paddled ahead of beast be delighted to enter water after long dusty journey most of after reaching opposite bank lay down for long time in willow water at edge most of store be carried across in canoe inflated skin be then fastened to waggon also be towed across stream by canoe passage have commenced at early morning by whole of caravan content be safely across stream be now mr harvey said in matabele country native be for most part friendly a know advantage derive from coming of english trader there be portion of tribe altogether hostile to greatest caution care have to be exercised in passing through portion of country to east lie land said to be very rich in gold there can be little doubt that be so for frequently find native who have traded with country in possession of gold dust allow white men to pas frontier on pretext whatever have become aware in way how great be value of gold in eye of european fear that if wealth of country in metal be known vast emigration of european must take place must assuredly sooner later end in driving out extirpation of present inhabitant of land news have learned at village where have crossed of state of affair among tribe of north be not encouraging native said that there have be much fighting not only have eruption taken place with tribe still further north matabele have also be quarrelling among be bad news indeed mr harvey said tribal war make journeying very difficult for although none of tribe may be hostile to european at ordinary time view with distrust when coming from tribe with whom be at war in peace time too when section of tribe be under sort of control by head chief will hesitate to rob attack european caravan because whole must consider aggrieved injured by such proceeding in war time on other hand think if rob rich caravan one else be sure to do so may a well have plunder a war be injurious to in other way instead of tribe spending time in hunting remain at home to guard village woman will find little ivory few ostrich feather gathered to trade for good have not intended to have encumbered with larger following think after what have heard will be wise to strengthen party before going further will therefore hire twenty men from village here to accompany will be useful in hunting will cost little wage be nominal will have difficulty in providing with food with rifle in one respect be more useful than men hired from time to time from among people farther north for purpose of driving game for a see many of carry gun while beyond river be armed only with bow arrow be surprised to see so many gun dick said where must people have got money to buy be result of very bad system mr harvey replied cape authority in spite of representation have be made to of extreme danger of allowing native to posse firearm allow importation sale to simply on account of revenue derive from a duty of pound be charged on gun imported into colony from part of south africa native pondos basuto zulu other kaffir go to diamond field work there for month when earnings suffice to enable to buy gun stock of ammunition blanket return to home fellow see carrying gun have served six eight month in diamond mine dozen of must be strong reinforcement to fighting power in case of attack there be difficulty in engaging required number of men be to be paid on conclusion of journey with certain quantity of powder lead few yard of cotton bead other cheap trinket be to be fed on journey thus reinforced caravan proceeded on way chapter eleven troop of lion country across waggon now made way differed somewhat from over have previously passed be not so undulating herbage be shorter more scanty soil be for most part sandy tree be much more abundant sometimes there be thick growth of jungle even before leaving transvaal have at night often heard roar of lion have not approached camp must look out for lion to night mr harvey said when caravan encamped near large pool in wet season formed part of river be now for most part dry must laager waggon get a many cattle inside a can must keep rest close together with fire in readiness to light in case of attack surely lion must never venture to attack so large party dick said in surprise will indeed mr harvey answered brute often hunt together a many a twenty thirty be nothing like such powerful beast a north african lion be formidable enough le see of better there be numerous print on sand near water probably large number of be in habit of coming to pool to drink expect therefore will have stirring night a soon a ox be unyoked be driven short distance out to pasture five six of native looked after while remainder set to work to gather stick dried wood for fire think tom said will go have bathe in pool will do such thing mr harvey remarked chance be that there be dozen alligator in pool be just sort of place in lurk for find difficulty in occasionally taking deer wild hog a come down to quench thirst there see something projecting above water on other side of pool see bit of rough wood look a if be top of log underneath water well just watch harvey said a took aim with rifle fired water instantly heaved whirled at spot boy be watching supposed log rose higher out of water then plunged down again five six foot of long tail lashed water then disappeared eddy on surface showed that there be violent agitation going on underneath do think of log now mr harvey asked smiling why be alligator tom said who must have thought looked just like bit of old tree what saw harvey said be portion of head alligator often lie with just eye nostril out of water did kill sir do think dick asked oh mr harvey replied ball must glance off head a must from side of ironclad ship woke up flustrated bit be none worse for so see tom that pool be hardly fit to bathe in indeed sir tom answered turning little pale at thought of danger have proposed to incur must rather fight dozen lion than get into water with brute know about dozen lion mr harvey said although certainly one lion be easier foe to tackle than alligator one can never be too careful about bathing in country in smallest pool only few yard long few foot wide alligator may be lurking especially if weather be dry pool far apart even when only drawing water at such place be well to be careful be always best plan to poke bottom for short distance round with pole before dipping in bucket remember if must ever happen to be seized by one of animal there be one chance be to turn at once stick thumb into eye requires nerve when brute have got by leg be only chance native when seized by alligator often escape by blinding foe pain sudden loss of sight always induces to loose hold hope will never have to try tom said shivering be safer not certainly mr harvey agreed there see dinner be ready jumbo have got bucket of water so can douse head wash hand without fear of alligator at cattle be driven in horse few of most valuable ox be placed in laager formed by waggon rest be fastened outside to side by side by horn at corner native have piled up great heap of firewood hour after sunset roar of lion be heard out on plain be answered simultaneously in six eight direction stamping of ox announced that animal be conscious of danger there be troop of about mr harvey said just a feared put little more wood on fire boy be a well to keep burning briskly will probably be hour before work up to make attack upon a time went on roaring became louder more continuous there must be score of at least mr harvey said be ranging round round camp like look of fire by ten o'clock roaring have approached so closely that mr harvey thought that be time to prepare for defence took post at one side of square placed boy jumbo at other three tony other hunter be to keep outside cattle walk round round armed native be scattered round square driver cattle men be to move about among animal do best to pacify for already perfect panic have seized upon draught cattle with starting eye coat ruffled by fear be tugging straining at rope quiet silly beast dick said leaning out of waggon in have taken place be safer where be than must be anywhere else if got away bolted out into plain a want to do must be pulled down killed in time fire be now blazing brightly throwing wide circle of light round camp making visible object within fifty yard have be arranged that so long a lion kept at distance only approached singly defender of various face of square must retain position must formidable attack be made upon one side white men with two of native with must hasten to point attacked several time a dick stood in waggon rifle in hand straining eye at darkness fancied saw indistinct shadowy form moving at edge of circle of light two three time raised rifle to take aim object be so indistinct that doubted whether fancy have not deceived presently crack of mr harvey rifle be heard followed by roar of sharper more angry nature than have preceded a if signal have be given three four creature came with great bound out of darkness towards side where dick be posted taking steady aim fired tony who be outside with cattle on side of square did same other native have be ordered to retain fire until lion be close enough to ensure shot telling lion at dick have aimed paused for moment with terrific roar then bounded forward again when came within twenty yard of ox four native posted by dick side fired lion for moment fell then gathering together sprang on to back of bullock just in front of where dick be standing lad have second rifle in readiness leaning forward placed muzzle within two yard of lion head fired animal rolled off back of bullock who with one standing next to at once began to kick at endeavouring to get head round to gore with horn lion however lay unmoved dick last shot have be fatal other lion on side have bounded back into darkness from other side of square sound of firing proclaimed that similar attack have be made a there be summons for aid dick supposed that attack be isolated one so after recharging rifle remained quietly at post for hour attack be not renewed though continuous roaring showed that lion be still close at hand mr harvey went round advised boy to lie down at post get little sleep a native must keep watch think have done with yet said have killed three think by roaring number have considerably increased within last hour be probable that attack will be made hour so before daybreak expect will be in earnest next time dick accordingly lay down to sleep be too excited to close eye after long time seemed to that roaring be dying away drowsiness be stealing over when suddenly mr harvey rifle be heard shouted to side quick be upon dick tom jumbo with six native leapt from waggon running across little enclosure scrambled up into on other side there be momentary silence here whole of defendant having discharged piece number of lion bounding across open be already close to cattle new comer at once opened fire two three of lion sprang among cattle rest intimidated by noise flash of gun by yelling shouting of native turned made off again among cattle be soon disposed of not before have killed three of draught ox seriously torn two others roaring continued until daybreak gradually however growing fainter more distant be evident that attack have ceased be skin worth anything dick asked yes be worth few dollar apiece except in case of old lion who be apt to become mangy be not worth skinning have killed eight of skin will not be worth anything like so much a cattle have killed however be well that be worse attack by troop of lion be joke be by far most formidable animal of south africa say that attack by herd of wild elephant must not be more serious never heard of such thing taking place be timid creature easily scared except in case of wounded animal of solitary bull can scarcely be considered a dangerous when day broke native set to work to skin lion with exception of one whose skin be valueless a soon a operation be completed skin be packed in waggon ox be inspanned caravan proceeded on way being glad to leave so dangerous locality next evening encamped upon river night passed without interruption following morning just a be about to start tony who with other hunter have gone out at daybreak returned with news that have found spoor of elephant that believed herd have passed along only few hour before mr harvey at once decided to halt where be for day ox be again unyoked six of armed native having be left to guard camp under direction of jumbo whole of rest with white men set off in pursuit of elephant spoor be quite distinct even have failed there must have be difficulty in following track for there be scattered here there tree elephant in passing have broken off many bough stripped of leaf lay upon ground have traversed tony other hunter whose name be blacking sobriquet gained from extreme swarthiness of skin scouted ahead presently held up hand to following to advance quietly tree be very thick here mr harvey boy dismounted led horse to spot where hunter have halted be standing at edge of large circular clearing three quarter of mile in diameter have probably at one time be site of native village for there be sign of cultivation number of scattered head of maize rose here there descendant of bygone mealy plantation feeding upon be herd of twenty elephant of greater portion be female young one there be three fine male one beast of unusual size be master of herd mr harvey said savage looking old customer have splendid pair of tusk although tip of one added gazing at elephant through field glass be broken off think that for present will leave alone direct attention to other two male will take tom jumbo with dick will have tony blacking three of native will go with party must not rely upon much remember one fatal spot be forehead fasten horse up here leave two of native in charge let other six go round to opposite side of clearing advance slowly from direction showing occasionally so a to draw attention of herd towards elephant will probably move leisurely in direction take station behind tree moving position carefully a approach so a to place yourselves a near a possible in line of elephant have fixed on will take up station hundred yard to right of where be standing do go a far to left native will take horse into thicket distance in rear whichever of two young male elephant come nearest to be mark ours be other if keep near other will probably meet again here two party moved off to place assigned to native whose duty be to drive elephant started to position keeping little distance back among tree so that must observe movement of elephant while unseen dick party moved to spot indicated then sat down for three quarter of hour elephant continued to feed upon head of maize then big male suddenly wheeled round extended great ear lifted trunk trumpeted at signal others gathered together stood gazing in direction from danger threatened again old bull gave angry scream others moved slowly away from danger advanced in direction in have seen native very bad elephant that tony whispered to dick give heap of trouble see charge minute two later elephant catching sight of enemy quickened pace with little tail switching angrily uplifted trunk widespread ear charged down upon at pace of dick have not supposed so cumbersome beast must be capable in moment distant native be seen to rise from grass to run at full speed back towards wood elephant pursued until reached tree here halted gazed for time into wood then seeing sign of native for knew better than to provoke so vicious beast by firing at trumpeted defiantly slowly retraced step towards rest of herd led by two male be already approaching tree behind dick party be lying concealed before have arrived there mr harvey party came up dick tom be carrying heavy smooth bore gun similar to used by boer father have purchased at newcastle on day of start be old weapon very strong serviceable carried heavy charge of powder large ball of mixture of lead tin specially made for elephant shooting dick fire first blacking whispered in ear if not kill then rest of fire dick be lying down behind trunk of tree rifle steadied against when elephant be within distance of twenty yard fired taking steady aim at vital point recoil of piece be tremendous roar of report almost stunned gave however shout of delight for elephant stood for minute swaying from side to side then fell heavily upon ground mr harvey have given tom first shot at other elephant just at moment when lad be about to fire elephant gave sudden start at report of dick rifle tom shot struck at side of head glancing off passed through ear throwing up trunk elephant instantly charged mr harvey fired uplifted trunk prevented getting accurate aim at vital spot bullet passed through trunk then glanced off forehead elephant swerved showed side at general volley be fired by gun still loaded great beast stood still for instant stumbled forward few stride then leg seemed to bend beneath sank down quietly to ground just at moment a affrighted cow be turning to fly across plain there be thundering rush great elephant charged through passing between dead male dashed into wood rush be so sudden headlong that carried elephant past men standing behind tree speedily checked turning round made rush upon there be instant stampede most of native at once threw away gun climbed hastily up into tree against be standing others took to bush elephant charged in after seeing sign of speedily came out again looked round for fresh foe eye fell upon dick who have just recharged rifle run dick run shouted mr harvey dick saw that elephant be upon while tree near be standing be too thick to climb elephant be holding head so high that dick must not aim at spot on forehead waiting until animal be within ten yard of fired into open mouth then leapt behind tree with scream of pain elephant rushed on being unable to check came full butt with tremendous force against tree quivered under blow dick thinking that be going to fall upon sprang back pace three four more shot be fired before elephant must turn then wheeling round charged upon new assailant tom be one of nearest to boy have just discharged rifle advanced few foot from tree behind have be standing before must regain felt something pas round there be tremendous squeeze stopped breath seemed to press life out of then felt flying high into air became insensible apparently satisfied with what have done elephant continued rapid pace into open again followed retreating herd across plain dick have given cry of horror a saw elephant seize friend heart seemed to stand still when saw whirled high in air tom fell into thick bushy tree there breaking through light foliage at top remained suspended in upper bough in instant jumbo climbed tree making way to lad lifted from fork in be wedged placed on shoulder a easily a if have be child descending tree laid on ground by side of mr harvey latter at once knelt beside thank god be breathing exclaimed at once lift head dick open shirt blacking give water out of gourd trust be only stunned that brute be in such hurry that have not time to squeeze fairly tree have broken fall if have come down to ground from height must have killed sprinkled water upon lad face chest to dick delight tom presently opened eye looked round in surprised half stupid way then made effort to rise cry broke from a did so lie still tom mr harvey said be hurt hope not severely cut shirt off dick expect of rib be broken upon mr harvey carefully feeling tom rib found a have expected that five of be broken three on one side two on other of rib be damaged tom said cheerfully be of great consequence seem pretty fairly in place now will bandage tightly so a to keep there then will carry back to waggon nurse until grow together again young bone soon heal in week ten day will hope be able to travel again have close shave of never met more savage beast than bull elephant in experience chapter twelve attack by elephant litter be speedily constructed from bough of tree tom being placed in be at once carried back to camp escorted by friend hunter remained behind to cut out tusk of two elephant have fallen portion of trunk foot be considered most delicate portion of elephant be laid aside for use of white men large quantity of meat be brought back to camp for native sound of firing have brought up people from small village two three mile away to immense joy be allowed to carry off enough meat to enable to feast to utmost extent of ability for week to come mr harvey have in course of wandering frequently have occasion to dress wound bandage broken bone be therefore able to apply necessary bandage to tom lad be soon lying in comparative ease on bed formed of rag generally boy slept in hammock mr harvey insisted that tom must lie perfectly straight on back until bone have begun to set again made sad mess with old bull to day dick said be humiliating to think that must have charged injured tom got away almost unscathed see sir dick said attacked unexpectedly gun be discharged came on with rush that there be getting steady shot at whole affair lasted little more than minute must say will go out to morrow morning mr harvey said take up track again see if can not get even with beast there be time enough to day for be still early herd will be so restless suspicious that there will be getting near must not care to face that old bull unless have fair chance of killing at first shot have magnificent pair of tusk ivory sell so high that must be worth good deal of trouble risk to get will go with sir dick must rather did not business will be more dangerous than usual must not like responsibility of having with tom have a narrow shave yesterday a ever saw certainly want two of on hand dick be not sorry at mr harvey decision for after charge of bull elephant felt just at present must not care about encountering next morning mr harvey accompanied by three native hunter greater portion of others started in pursuit of elephant dick after sitting for time with tom took gun wandered round near camp shooting bird a sun got high heat became fiercer fiercer returned to camp have just taken off coat sat down by side of tom when heard shout of terror outside tent running out to see what be matter saw native in state of wild terror pointed across plain dick to astonishment alarm saw great elephant approaching at rapid trot with trunk in air ear extended to fullest recognised at once bull have charged on previous day native be now flying in direction dick shouted to to stand get musket word be unheeded ran to tent seized long bore gun have carried day before also that of tom charged hastily coolly what on earth be about tom asked be elephant again tom lie quiet do can not run away so lie just a be then with gun in hand dick ran out of tent again elephant be now hundred yard away dick climbed into waggon standing in line on be coming knelt down in bottom rested muzzle on side standing up waving arm before did so so a to attract attention of elephant great beast saw trumpeting loudly came straight down at dick knelt a steady a rock with sight of gun upon elephant forehead when be within twenty yard dick drew trigger without waiting to see result snatched up levelled second gun elephant have staggered a be hit then a with great effort pulled together again moved forward with stumbling hesitating step taking steady aim again dick fired when elephant trunk be within yard of muzzle of gun then springing to foot leapt on opposite side of waggon took to heel after running few step glanced back over shoulder then ceased running elephant be longer in sight above waggon have fallen inert mass by side right tom dick shouted loudly have done for before going to look at fallen elephant dick went to spot where stood piled musket of native who have fled dropping ramrod into found that two be loaded taking in hand advanced towards elephant precaution be needle great beast lay dead two heavy ball have struck within inch two of other penetrated brain first must have be fatal elephant be about to fall when dick have fired second time gradually driver other native returned to camp with shout of triumph however dick speedily silenced by volley of abuse for cowardice in running away leaving tom to fate few minute later mr harvey galloped in at full speed closely followed by swift footed blacking thank god be safe boy mr harvey said a leapt from horse have have terrible fright followed spoor to point where have passed night here tracker be much puzzled by fact that great elephant whose track be easily distinguished from others seemed to have passed night in rushing furiously about number of young tree have be torn up by root great branch twisted off larger tree concluded that must have received wound have maddened with pain took up track where herd have moved on soon found that have separated from have gone off at full speed by set off in pursuit observing good deal of caution for if have turned a be likely enough have come upon while in such frantic state must have have to bolt for life be thinking only of when saw hunter talking together gesticulating soon found out what be matter told that if elephant kept on in line be taking must assuredly bring in sight of camp if not straight upon a have doubt that must in case attack put spur to horse at once dashed on at full speed in hope of overtaking elephant turning before came within sight of camp became more more anxious a neared camp found elephant be still before then heard two shot close together must hear others may guess how relieved be when caught sight of camp saw native gathered round something be have doubt elephant have feared that must see whole place in confusion waggon upset above tent levelled thank god dear boy be safe now tell about dick related circumstance mr harvey praised highly for promptness coolness courage with have acted then roundly abused native in own language for cowardly conduct be not ashamed of yourselves asked what do carry arm for if be afraid to use here be sixteen men with musket who run away in panic leave one white lad to defend wounded friend alone reproach of mr harvey be mild by side of abuse three hunter for by time tony jumbo have reached camp lavished upon compatriot what be good for asked scornfully be fit only to be slave to dutch master have better hire woman to march with ought to take arm away to set to spin crestfallen a native be at own cowardice be roused by abuse of hunter furious quarrel must have ensued have not mr harvey interposed authority smoothed matter down admitting that attack of enraged elephant be really terrifying telling native now saw how well white men must fight must doubt be ready to stand by next time hunter now proceeded to cut out tusk of elephant when did so cause of animal singular behaviour became manifest ball have struck just at root of tusk have buried in one of nerve there doubt causing excruciating pain tusk be grand one mr harvey saying that have seldom seen finer pair news of slaughter of three elephant drew together considerable number of native who be delighted to receive permission to carry off a much meat a chose when greater portion of flesh of old bull have be removed ten ox be harnessed to remains of carcass be dragged to distance from camp a mr harvey be desirous of remaining where be for day longer on tom account effluvium from carcass must in very short time have rendered camp uninhabitable have remained in vicinity in week tom be convalescent be still however very stiff sore hammock be therefore slung under tilt of one of waggon side be drawn up to allow of free passage of air caravan then went forward on journey for next fortnight nothing of importance happened sometimes journey be short sometimes extremely long being regulated entirely by occurrence of water at many of halting place good deal of trade be done a news of coming of caravan spread far ahead of native for considerable distance on side of line of route came down to trade with brought with skin of beast bird small packet of gold dust ostrich feather occasionally ivory mr harvey be well content with success so far for time past owing to disturbed state of country demand for waggon occasioned by war number of trader who have made way north have be very small native consequently be eager to buy cotton cloth to get rid of article have be accumulating for purpose of barter with white never before mr harvey said have done so good trade in so short time at end of fortnight after starting tom be again able to take seat in saddle ride quietly along by side of caravan mr harvey warning on account to go above walking pace at present a jerk jar might break newly knit bone undo work have be effected in meantime dick accompanied by one other of hunter always rode out from line of march have difficulty in providing ample supply of game be careful however not to shoot more than be required for mr harvey viewed with abhorrence taking of life unnecessarily merely for purpose of sport be able nevertheless to kill great many deer without feeling that flesh be wasted for not only be number of mouth in caravan large power of eating wonderful native who came in to trade be always glad to eat up surplus remained indeed mr harvey found liberal distribution of meat opened heart much facilitated trade two three day after have left scene of elephant hunt object be seen far out on plain hunter at once pronounced to be ostrich dick must have started in pursuit mr harvey checked can run said faster than horse can gallop can indeed be ridden down a almost always run in great circle pursuit can be taken up with fresh horse be long business will send hunter out first to get on other side of when be posted will ride out going quite slowly attention of bird will be directed to will give hunter opportunity of creeping up on other side shooting lassoing if be not mistaken have good many young one with be about time of year when be usually case if must catch dozen of must be prize for fetch good sum down in colony where ostrich farming be carried on on large scale be very easily tamed must soon keep with caravan give trouble after remaining quiet for little time to give hunter time to make wide circuit mr harvey dick rode quietly forward towards bird who stood on slight swell of ground at distance of about mile evidently watching caravan with great interest by mr harvey instruction dick unrolled blanket always carried on saddle taking end in hand held out at arm length on level with top of head mr harvey doing same be silly bird mr harvey said attention be easily caught by anything understand like other wild creature be afraid of man by holding blanket out like sail see outline can not make out what strange creature advancing towards can be at foot pace advanced towards ostrich made sign of retreat until horseman approached to within about seventy yard then from brow behind bird three hunter suddenly rose up whirling ball of lasso round head launched among ostrich three bird fell with cord twisted round leg two more be shot a startled flock dashed off at full speed across plain mr harvey dick dropped blanket started at full gallop bring down old bird if can dick then let rest go give attention to cutting off young one dick fired at one of old bird missed mr harvey brought one to ground young ostrich be few week old soon began to tail off in race after ten minute riding mr harvey dick have satisfaction of getting ahead of turning little more driving brought frightened creature to standstill most of dropped in squatting position to ground huddled together like frightened chicken be sixteen in number one have fallen broken leg be at once shot leg of young ostrich be extremely brittle one of trouble of farmer who rear be that so frequently break bone have to be killed blacking be sent off at best speed to overtake caravan bring back dozen men with ostrich have be lassoed have be at once killed by hunter feather of five killed by of shot by mr harvey be pulled out three out of six be in splendid plumage how much be of feather worth dick asked fine white one will fetch from pound to pound shilling apiece out here a high a shilling perfect ostrich feather fit for court plume will sell in england for pound to pound small dark coloured feather be worth from sixpence to one shilling apiece young bird after wing have be tied to side be lifted carried away dick being unable to help laughing at long leg sticking out in front of bearer at long neck beak with from time to time inflicted sharp peck on men who be carrying when caravan be overtaken bird be placed in waggon in evening be liberated inside laager formed by waggon grain be thrown to soon began to pick up after expression be rather one of curiosity than fear exhibited alarm whatever when dick scattering more corn came in moved quietly among for first few day be carried in waggon at end of time be completely domesticated after camp be formed walked about like barn door fowl picking up scrap of food be thrown to indeed getting so bold a sometimes to attempt to snatch from men hand when on march stalked gravely along by side of waggon what be value of ostrich dick asked mr harvey one day ostrich of about three four month old mr harvey replied be worth from pound to pound full grown cock two hen stock with most small settler begin ostrich farming be worth from pound to pound hen will lay about fifty egg in year so that if only half be reared sold at rate of pound apiece be low price at three week old there be good profit upon young bird increase in value at rate of about pound per month feather be generally sold by weight fine plume go from seventy to ninety to pound fetch from to pound feather of wild bird be worth third more than of tame one a be stronger quantity of feather sold be astonishing one firm in port elizabeth often buy pound weight of ostrich feather per week of course be not first class plume price range down a low a pound shilling for poorest kind where do get water out here in desert have difficulty here mr harvey replied for ostrich think nothing of going twenty thirty mile require to drink very seldom how many feather can be plucked from bird year about three quarter of pound of first class feather besides inferior sort there be now such quantity of ostrich in colony that price of feather have gone down materially be now not so high a figure have given highest class feather however still maintain price be likely to do so for demand for feather in europe increase at a rapid rate a doe production suppose must not be kept in england dick asked for there must be splendid profit on such farming mr harvey replied want above thing dry climate warmth be of course important even be le essential than dryness may be reared in england under artificial condition must never grow up strong healthy in way must doubt be liable to disease besides a even in native country see that feather deteriorate in strength diminish in value in domesticated bird there must probably be so great falling off in yield value of feather in bird kept under artificial condition in england that speculation must not be likely to pay do hen sit on egg a ordinary hen just same mr harvey answered very funny look with long leg sticking out not only doe hen sit cock take turn at keeping egg warm when mother go out to feed will ask father dick said when get back to arrange to take fifteen ostrich a part of share of venture must be great fun to see stalking about ah have not got home yet mr harvey replied smiling must not be too sanguine have certainly begun capitally there be saying what adventure be before yet have be particularly fortunate in seeing nothing of tzetze fly a know have made several considerable detour to avoid tract of country where be known to prevail still occasionally be met with in unexpected place have seldom made trip without losing of horse cattle from how be that fly can kill horse be not larger than blue bottle at home for saw one in naturalist window in pieter maritzburg be mystery dick have not yet be solved there be fly in other part of world whose bite be sufficiently poisonous to raise bump underneath skin of animal nothing approaching tzetze in virulence certainly appears unaccountable that venom of so small creature must be able to kill great animal like horse ox be found only in south of africa dick extends more le over whole of plateau land of africa be almost a great scourge in highland of egypt a be here wonder dick said thoughtfully why tzetze be created most insect be useful a scavenger to furnish food for bird can not see use of fly be so terribly destructive a ca tell boy mr harvey said that everything even tzetze have good purpose may be sure even though be hidden from possibly for example may be discovered day that tzetze be invaluable medicine for disease to man be subject just a blistering powder be obtained from crest body of cantharides beetle however must be content to take on trust must leave descendant something to discover know dick for if go on inventing discovering a be doing be clear that must look out for fresh channel for research chapter thirteen brush with native one day jumbo touched dick arm a be riding along with caravan pointing to clump of tree at little distance said giraffe dick reined in horse gazed at tree see said be very difficult to see mr harvey remarked have knack somehow of standing so a to look like part of tree see if jumbo say be there may be sure be be skin valuable dick asked dick must not be worth cumbering with be flesh very good to eat say can not be eaten have plenty of venison never like shooting giraffe when can help clumsy awkward a be have wonderfully soft expressive eye know anything more piteous than look of dying giraffe however if ride up to tree set scampering will get good laugh for run be a awkward clumsy a of living creature dick accordingly started at gallop towards tree be not until be close to that saw three giraffe two old one young one started off a approached at pace seemed to dick to be slow a well a extraordinarily clumsy two old one kept between offspring pursuer a if to shield from shot dick however have idea of firing only wished to gallop up close so a to get nearer view of singular beast to astonishment found that although horse be going at best speed apparently slow moving giraffe be steadily gaining upon must hardly at first believe eye be gradually tailed off at last reining in horse sat in saddle enjoyed good laugh at strange trio in front of with long straggling leg neck when rejoined caravan mr harvey who have watched pursuit asked laughingly if managed to catch giraffe might a soon have tried to catch express train went right away from tommy can gallop too have chance with although did best do move along at tremendous pace in clumsy fashion take such immense stride with odd long leg of theirs one have idea of speed until one chase never knew new hand who tried be sure to come back with crestfallen face three week after leaving what called elephant camp caravan halted for two day have now arrived at spot where trouble with native might be expected to begin be at border of matabele country here mr harvey intended to turn west after keeping along for time to bend to south re enter colony north of kimberley to journey down to port elizabeth be principal mart for good from interior between matabele tribe on border hostility have for time prevailed while halted mr harvey sent forward blacking with few present to chief of next tribe saying that be coming through country to trade asking for promise that must not be interfered with in passage at end of second day messenger returned chief say come say have be long time without trade before answered talked with chief know whether mean honestly tribe have bad name be thief robber well will go on mr harvey said nevertheless have got chief word will not after venture to attack openly for if did know very well that more trader must visit country people may make attack upon be strong enough to hold own muster about thirty gun in laager must be able to beat off whole tribe did attack will however while travelling through country be more careful than waggon will when be possible travel two abreast so that line will not be so long to guard must not wander away to shoot fortunately have store of dried meat will last for time on following morning caravan set out after travelling twelve mile halted on bank of stream soon after have formed camp five six native came in brought few bunch of ostrich plume otter skin bartered for cotton having concluded bargain wandered about in camp a be custom of native peeping into waggon examining bullock looking at arrangement with childish curiosity expect fellow have come a spy rather than trader mr harvey said to lad a general thing native come in with wife child see be men observed too that have particularly examined pile of musket a if reckoning up mean of defence in future instead of merely couple of men to look after cattle keep off marauder will put six night on guard will be relieved twice during night one of hunter will be in charge of watch if there be sign of trouble will take by turn two three time night sentry perceived moving object near camp challenged in case object at once disappeared whether be hyena crawling men must not be discerned at halt next day much larger number of native came in satisfactory amount of trade be done demeanour however be insolent overbearing of went away with good declining to accept exchange offered after have left camp several small article be missed next day passed across plain abounding in game mr harvey said that boy three hunter might go out kill fresh meat warned dick tom not to allow ardour in chase to carry away from hunter to keep a much a possible together when have killed a many animal a must be carried on horse hunter shoulder be to return at once be first time tom have be out hunting since accident bone have set well beyond little stiffness occasional pain be quite again be glad to be riding out again with dick said have be awfully slow work jogging along by side of caravan in addition to three hunter took a usual native with to hold horse must be necessary to dismount stalk game instead of chasing shooting from saddle exercise in by time boy be efficient found more difficulty in getting up to game than have expected hunter said confidently that animal must have be chased disturbed within few hour have accordingly to go four five mile across plain before must get shot at last saw herd feeding in valley after experience have have that morning of futility of attempting to get near deer on horseback determined that hunter must make circuit come down upon herd from different point tom dick be to stay on brow where be then standing keeping well back so a to be out of sight from valley until heard report of first gun when be to mount endeavour to cut off head deer back upon others hunter then started jumbo blacking going to right tony other to left after hour walking reached place at point about equidistant from other forming with tom dick complete circle round deer be enabled to keep other in sight although hidden from herd in hollow when have gained station lay down began to crawl towards deer until be within yard of herd latter continued grazing quietly then old buck gave short sharp cry struck ground violently with hoof others ceased feeding gazed with startled eye to windward be about to dash off in body when four men fired almost simultaneously a many stag fell rest darted off at full speed in direction in tom dick be posted that being only side open to instant later tom dick appeared on horseback on brow dashed down towards herd alarmed at appearance of fresh enemy broke into two body scattering right left giving lad opportunity for good shot succeeded in bringing down mark then dismounted giving horse to native joined hunter have bagged six deer hunter at once proceeded to disembowel one be to be slung behind of saddle others must be carried by hunter native while be so engaged be startled by shout saw native running down towards leading horse gesticulating wildly be attacked blacking said almost at same moment three four arrow fell among have collected dead deer at one spot be standing in group looking round saw large number of native crowning low hill round saw that while have be stalking deer have be stalked by native without moment hesitation hunter disposed body of deer in circle seizing two horse threw beside deer fastening limb with lasso carried so that must not move then six men threw down in circle have be done in couple of minute arrow be falling fast among none have be hit a soon a preparation be complete opened steady fire at enemy with exception of man who have come out with horse be good shot steady fire at once checked advance of native whose triumphant yelling ceased a man after man went down speedily followed example of opponent throwing down on grass kept up fire with arrow in circle of seventy eighty yard round hunter gradually however fire ceased for to use bow be obliged to show head above grass whenever one did so sharp crack of rifle be heard so often did bullet fly true to aim that native soon grew chary of exposing what will do now dick asked a firing ceased be coward jumbo said contemptuously if have be zulu swazi matabele must have rushed in upon finished at once well be very glad be not dick said what be to be done will wait for night tony answered then when can not see will creep up close charge in case dick said best thing will be for to keep in body fight way through make for camp jumbo shook head quiet now because think got safe if try to get away rush down upon shoot many get killed then dick said best thing will be for to jump on horse ride straight through if get off alive will make for caravan bring back mr harvey rest to assistance good blacking said horse must be stuck full of arrow before get away drop dead kill go must be just a dangerous for a for blacking hunter said directly stand up to get on horse see get ready to shoot horse fall dead before reach will crawl through grass will not see till get to perhaps get through without seeing at if not jump up sudden run surprised shoot straight once through line never catch jumbo tony assented with grunt dick seeing that better plan must be suggested offered opposition to young hunter undertaking task leaving gun ammunition behind black at once without word crawled out between carcase of deer making way like snake perfectly flat on stomach soon be only by very slight movement of grass be nearly two foot high that dick must follow progress must not do for long arrow whizzing close to head warned that be exposing lay down behind stag listened with intense eagerness for outcry must arise when blacking be discovered seemed long time so slow cautious be black advance at last there be sudden yell little party sure that attention of assailant must for moment be diverted raised head from shelter looked out saw blacking bounding at full speed up slope score of native have sprung to foot be discharging arrow in direction of fugitive who zigzagged a ran with rapid bound to unsteady divert aim one arrow struck in side saw break off feather head pull through wound throw away without moment pause in flight be serious wound tom asked eagerly jumbo shook head not kill said too near skin by time blacking pursuer have thrown bow across shoulder grasping assagai have started in pursuit catch tony said confidently blacking clever man not run too fast let keep close behind think catch keep on running way to camp people here watch not tink to attack then wait again for oder to come back half of dem gone good many killed not like to attack now what do say tony will get up follow in body slowly must be good plan tony said if sure more black men come if others come join dem dey attack out on plain got stag to lie behind dey fight hard know that blacking have got away that help come make bad affair of better stop here presently two three of native be seen coming back over brow having given up pursuit dick rifle be good one brow be not more than yard away took steady aim fired one of native fell yell of astonishment broke from others threw instantly on grass however although long enough to shelter in bottom be shorter scantier on slope inclined position too enabled dick to see again fired must not see where ball struck must have be close to two native for leapt to foot bounded back again over brow be capital shot of yours dick tom said will try next time rifle will carry easily enough a far a although hunter wo if can prevent of fellow who have gone after blacking from coming down rejoining round be safe enough for if did not dare to make rush when there be about sixty of will not try now when there be not that number hour later party of ten twelve native appeared again on brow dick tom at once fired one of fell rest again retired behind brow shouting something to below tony at once translated that blacking have got away news added to effect of fall of comrade on height dispirited native below one two be to be seen stealing up slope dick tom be on alert one of native fell with broken leg completed uneasiness of party below creeping away from deadly rifle to foot of slope suddenly rose bounded up general volley be fired by beleaguered party two more native fell rest dashed up slope two of on way lifting carrying off wounded comrade right now jumbo said dey attack here more like enough dey wait lie in ambush in grass in case move away not do that sit here quietly till caravan arrive do think mr harvey will bring whole caravan sure to do dat jumbo said able to leave party to protect waggon to send party here to bring caravan along together if attacked make laager tink dey attack people ready to cut off little party den chief say not responsible if people attack caravan dat different thing hour passed slowly heat in bottom a sun almost overhead poured ray down into be very great a hour passed on heat became le oppressive be with intense pleasure that boy saw mr harvey suddenly appear on brow checking horse gaze into valley leapt to foot gave shout be answered by mr harvey be round still shouted have gone dick replied mr harvey at once rode down by time reached hunter have freed leg of horse struggled to foot have given nice fright mr harvey said a rode up have have pretty good fright ourselves dick replied if have not be for blacking pluckily getting through to take news think must have seen daylight be much hurt sir have got nasty wound mr harvey replied arrow have gone between rib fell down from loss of blood when reached have gone much farther must have be overtaken be close upon heel when got in fortunately halted caravan soon after started when saw herd making way thought better to wait till rejoined be well did so noticed couple of mile away when saw be pursued went out with six men met mile from caravan have just strength left to tell have happened then went back to caravan moved out towards be obliged to come slowly for there be good many native out on plain twice looked so threatening have to laager treat to few distant shot evidently did not like range of rifle so have come on without serious fighting have be in great fright about blacking when recovered from faint told that thought be safe for while a nearly party have be attacking have followed that have already killed so many that thought must not venture to attack before now have better come up to waggon at once can tell about afterwards deer have formed such useful shelter be now lifted in quarter of hour party reached waggon without molestation vigilant watch be kept night alarm be given in morning mr harvey rode down with lad hunter into valley except here there be deep blood stain sign of conflict remained native having carried off dead in course of night hunter after examining ground declared that fifteen of enemy have fallen including shot on slope journey be now resumed at next halt native came in to trade a usual when questioned professed entire ignorance of attack on hunter three day later without further adventure arrived at kraal of principal chief be large village great number of cattle be grazing in neighbourhood native have sullen appearance exhibited active hostility mr harvey formed waggon in laager few hundred yard outside village then accompanied by boy proceeded to chief abode be at once conducted to presence be seated in hut of bee hive form rather larger than surrounded when white men crawled in through door like in native structure be not more than three foot high be at first unable to see so dark be interior chief uttered usual word of welcome have complaint to make chief mr harvey said against of people attacked two friend of follower when out hunting fortunately be repulsed with loss of fifteen of number doe not make attack upon le inexcusable be bad chief said how doe friend white trader know that be men be inside territory anyhow mr harvey said be upon third day after have left matabele must have be party of matabele chief said often come into territory to steal cattle be bad men people be very good ca prove that be people mr harvey said may think warn chief that if there be repetition of attack while be in country will have more trader here who attacked have learned that can defend that be more likely to get death than plunder out of attempt chapter fourteen trapped in defile what do think of affair dick asked mr harvey a on leaving chief hut walked back to waggon for moment think be perfectly safe chief must not venture to attack while be in village in first place must put stop to trade in second far a be from frontier must not feel safe be massacre to take place in village know well enough that be dozen white men to come out to avenge deed with few waggon load of good to offer to neighbour a pay for assistance tribe must be exterminated when be once on way again must beware feeling among tribe at loss have sustained must be very bitter although may repress outward exhibition of to if attack just a be on line between land neighbour can deny knowledge of however will not catch asleep see men have put waggon in laager tom said yes told to do so mr harvey answered be custom always with trader travelling north of limpopo therefore will not be taken a sign of suspicion of good faith fair index to of disposition will be amount of trade if bring good freely may assume that there be fixed intention of attacking for if be determined to seize good who have article to trade must not care to part with when must hope to obtain share of good for nothing next morning mr harvey spread out few of good hardly of native came forward with article for barter in afternoon mr harvey went across to chief how be asked that people bring in good for sale among tribe through have passed have done much trade see that give good bargain people bring nothing if wish to trade with white men let say so will tell brother that be of use to bring waggon so far people be very poor chief said have be at war with neighbour have have time to hunt ostrich to get skin can not have be fighting time mr harvey rejoined must have taken fur skin be clear that wish to trade tomorrow morning will go on way there be many other tribe who will be glad at coming of white trader after mr harvey return to waggon be evident that order have be issued that trade must be done for several parcel of inferior kind of ostrich feather skin be brought in a be clear however that genuine trade be to be done at daybreak ox be inspanned caravan continued journey for next two day track lay across open country sign of molestation be met with be now coming mr harvey said to very worst part of journey hill have seen in front of for last two day have to be crossed to morrow ascend lower slope be tolerably easy next day have to pas through very wild gorge road be bed of stream mount rapidly ravine be nearly ten mile in length once at head be near highest point of shoulder over have to cross descent on other side be comparatively easy if must avoid spot must do so know of other road by waggon must cross range for very long distance way be one always used by trader in wet season be altogether impassable for in place ravine narrow to fifteen yard with perpendicular cliff on side at point river when in flood rush down twenty thirty foot deep even putting aside danger of attack in going through must gladly avoid if must for weather be breaking have already have shower may get heavy thunderstorm tremendous downfall of rain day next day journey be arduous one ground be rough broken valley up road lay be frequently thickly strewn with boulder showed force with water in flood time rushed down over what be now empty bed after long day work caravan halted for night at spot where valley narrowed to ravine have be pretty hard day work to day tom said be nothing to to morrow a will see mr harvey replied trader consider defile to be very hardest passage anywhere in south africa there be plenty of other bad bit too in many case will see will have to unload waggon will be that double team can do to pull up empty sometimes of course defile be easier than at others depends much upon action of last flood in year rock boulder have be jammed so thickly in narrow part that defile have be absolutely impassable following year perhaps obstruction have be swept away to certain extent levelled by space between rock being filled up with small stone sand how be season know up to time left have heard of trader having passed along way have spoken of a day journey be only under most favourable circumstance that have ever be accomplished in time sometimes trader have be three four day in getting through directly caravan halted blacking jumbo started to examine defile be already growing dusk be only able to get two mile up before be so dark that must make way further returned saying that first portion of defile be usually one of most difficult be in bad condition that many enormous boulder be lying in bottom that appeared to be practicable although in place waggon must have to be unloaded at daybreak ox be inspanned in quarter of hour leading waggon approached entrance of gorge seemed cut through perpendicular cliff foot high gorge through river issued appearing mere narrow crack rent by convulsion of nature must be fearful place to be attacked in dick said few men with rock up above must destroy mr harvey said see up there dick looked up on one side of passage saw tiny figure three hunter ten of men with musket be up there started three hour ago a must have to go jumbo said five mile along face of cliff before reached point where must make ascent so a to gain edge of ravine will keep along parallel with fire must clear side be not usual to take precaution of sort after attack of other day attitude of chief people can not be too cautious after passing through first three mile of defile ravine widens into valley hundred yard wide here will come down join there be two other ravine similar to first to be passed through country there be so wild broken that must be impossible for to keep along on height doubt whether even native must find point from to attack have now fairly entered ravine for thirty forty foot up wall be smooth polished by action of winter torrent above jagged rock overhung path at point cliff nearly met overhead although be now almost broad daylight in depth of ravine light be dim obscure boy at first be awestruck at scene attention be soon called to difficulty of pas bed of stream be covered with rock of size sometimes great boulder a big a good sized cottage almost entirely blocked way must have done so altogether have not small boulder round formed slope on side depth of ravine echoed re echoed with noise like thunder shout of driver crack of whip a ox struggled on waggon bumped lurched along over stone native white worked hardest clearing away block a far a possible from track required for waggon armed with long wooden lever four six together prized away heavy boulder when be too massive to be moved by strength when other path must be chosen piled number of smaller block so a to make sort of ascent up wheel must travel waggon moved one at time united effort of whole party being required to enable to get along when leading waggon have moved forward hundred yard next in succession must be brought up so on until six waggon be again in line then hand must set to work ahead prepare path for hundred yard in two place however effort sufficed to clear way block rose in such jagged mass that be absolutely impossible for ox to pull across indeed be with greatest difficulty that when unyoked be one by one got over then tackle be fastened from top of rock to waggon below rope block being generally carried by traveller for such emergency ox fastened to end of rope with purchase so obtained waggon be dragged bodily one by one over obstacle be not until late in afternoon that party passed safely through defile reached valley beyond men animal worn out by exertion have undergone day have not passed without excitement for when be engaged at most difficult point of journey crack of rifle be heard far overhead for hour steady fire be kept up there below be of course wholly ignorant of what be passing there for time suffered considerable anxiety for if guard above have be overpowered must have be destroyed by rock cast down by foe at end of hour firing ceased be not until camped for night in valley beyond gorge that learned from hunter who joined there what have happened there be jumbo explained three four hundred native fortunately approached from opposite side of gorge consequently little party of defender be in danger of attack enemy have be disconcerted when first opened fire have then pressed forward to get to edge of ravine superior weapon of defender have however checked finding that there be possibility of coming to close quarter with little band have after losing several of number abandoned attempt fallen back soon after nightfall be startled by heavy crashing sound great rock came bounding down side of valley cattle waggon be at once moved to centre of watercourse here be safe for bottom of valley be so thickly strewn with great boulder tremendous a be force with rock loosened far above came bounding down be either arrested shivered into fragment by obstacle before reached centre of valley reply to bombardment of position be attempted enemy be invisible there be clue to position far up on hill side so long a rolling down of rock be continued be certain that attack at close quarter be intended consequently after posting four sentry to arouse in case of need rest of party picking out softest piece of ground must find between stone lay down to rest before doing so however mr harvey have consultation with hunter said that next narrow ravine be broken by several lateral defile of similar character came down into that must therefore be quite impossible to keep along top whether there be point at enemy must take post assail from above knew not there be then nothing to do to push steadily on early next morning resumed way on preceding day slight shower of rain have fallen have be insufficient to increase notably water of streamlet trickled down among rock for most part hidden from view hunter be of opinion that heavier storm be at hand mr harvey agreed with in belief be in very nasty position boy said wish now that have turned south made way down to limpopo again kept along bank until past mountain range must have meant loss of two month time country will reach when get through defile be very good one for trade still be sorry now that did not adopt plan for what with native torrent position be extremely serious one however there be nothing for to push on now have passed one out of three gorge even if other two be in a bad condition a one came up yesterday two more day labour will see through a caravan moved along valley yell of native high up on slope rose loud menacing must have be disgusted at seeing that labour upon have be engaged whole night of loosening setting in motion rock have be entirely thrown away for must see that waggon team be wholly uninjured a caravan reached point where valley narrowed again mile above halting place began to descend slope a if meditated attack rifle of white three hunter opened fire upon checked on bare side of hill many however went farther down descending into valley crept up under shelter of stone boulder a soon a came within range opened fire with bow arrow by time however waggon be entering ravine although at entrance abrupt perpendicular than below soon assumed precisely similar character once well within shelter mr harvey posted dick with three hunter four of other native to defend rear be matter of little difficulty two three hundred yard up ravine barrier similar to met with on previous day be encountered waggon have to be dragged up by rope operation took upwards of three hour while passage be being effected dick with party have remained near mouth of ravine have be busy with enemy who pressed after last waggon have safely crossed barrier took station at point must have held against number of enemy caravan proceeded on way men animal labouring to utmost when at point where side of rock seemed nearly to close above narrow line of sky only being visible great rock came crushing leaping down bounding from side to side with tremendous uproar bringing down with shower of smaller rock have dislodged in course bottom of ravine be here about twelve yard wide happened to be unusually level great rock must have weighed ton fell on one side of leading waggon burst into fragment flew in direction fortunately one be hurt scream of dismay broke from native steady mr harvey shouted push on ahead man keep to work first who attempt to run desert waggon will shoot through head tom go on hundred yard in front keep distance ahead of leading waggon shoot down at once one who attempt to pas rock followed rock in quick succession there be however fortunately bulge in cliff on righthand side projecting twenty foot out a block struck be hurled off to left side of path seeing mr harvey kept waggon close along on right although several of ox three four of men be struck by detached fragment from above by splinter from stone a fell none be seriously injured long after caravan have passed point rock continued to thunder down showing mr harvey that above be unable to see to bottom of gorge that be discharging missile at random short distance farther cross ravine mere cleft in rock five foot wide at bottom be passed mr harvey congratulated at certainty that must bar progress of foe above prevent attack being renewed from point farther on at point so formidable obstacle be met with in massive rock thirty foot high jammed in narrowest part of ravine that waggon have to be emptied hauled by rope up almost perpendicular rock ox being taken through passage with immense labour men managed to clear of stone under one of angle of rock be not until after dark that reached spot where ravine again widened out into valley having spent sixteen hour in accomplishing distance of only three mile however congratulated that two third of labour be over that one more defile have to be surmounted rear guard remained encamped at opening of defile night passed without interruption native being doubtless disheartened by failure to destroy caravan by rock from above do think there be chance of attacking to night down slope a did morning tom asked mr harvey none latter replied a will see in morning valley doe not resemble last rock rise almost perpendicularly on side must not be possible for to make way down even if wanted to do so with first dawn of light ox be inspanned just a be starting one of native of dick party came up to mr harvey reported that native in large number be showing in ravine sharp crack of rifle almost at same moment broke out confirmed statement defile must be held mr harvey said until be well in next pas when last waggon have entered will send back word must then follow hold entrance tom have better take four more of armed native to strengthen rear guard tell dick to come on join have fair share of labour yesterday hand be cut about so by lifting heaving rock that must be able to do little to day be rather good sign that native be pressing forward in such force on rear a show that have great faith in attempt may make to day to repeat rock throwing experiment of yesterday a before two native be sent on ahead to examine defile mr harvey moved on with caravan until reached upper edge of valley be scarcely mile long just a did so native came hurriedly down defile reported that short distance up have met with obstacle to full a difficult a have got waggon over on preceding day that a turned angle in defile came in sight of be saluted by shower of arrow saw crowd of native on top of barrier have thrown down behind boulder have obtained good view of native obstacle be forty foot farther up be formed by three four great boulder jambed in together on other side small boulder stone seemed to have be piled up by torrent to level of rock on lower side be almost perpendicular questioned if man must climb certainly there be passage for ox chapter fifteen mountain torrent news brought by scout be very serious continued fire in rear showed that enemy be making serious attack in quarter mr harvey feared that fighting force there must be weakened greatly to enable to attack so formidable position a enemy occupied in front before arriving at decision a to best course halted caravan went forward with two native to inspect position have discovered when reached turn in defile crawled forward among boulder until reached spot where must obtain clear view of barrier be to full a formidable a have be described by scout must have needed active man to scale rock without opposition from above while on top dense body of native be clustered numbering at least fifty probably considerable portion of force be concealed from view mr harvey sent back one of native to tell dick to come on join after be to go back bid jumbo come up a mr harvey have great confidence in hunter shrewdness dick presently arrived be much impressed with formidable nature of obstacle might creep forward said among stone soon drive fellow off edge must only lie down behind must easily destroy a climbed one by one to top one a got up must be riddled with assagai what be thinking of doing sir know what be best dick quite agree with be tremendous position to storm on other hand must be almost a bad to retreat ten minute later jumbo arrived at run without word threw down by side of mr harvey for two three minute gazed silently at obstacle ahead then to mr harvey surprise turned over on to back lay there with eye open what on earth be doing jumbo look there sir native said pointing to glistening spot size of crown piece on stomach well what of mr harvey said be drop of rain there be fallen on hat what do think of place ahead think nothing about sir that place sir consequence one way other hear sir a spoke louder crash of thunder burst overhead mr harvey looked up now that portion of sky must be seen be inky black great drop of rain be falling with pattering sound on rock storm come sir very bad storm see coming say to massa tom two tree hour fight over now see someting like mountain storm in tree hour water come down twenty foot deep be right jumbo be lucky storm have begun so early if have got far into defile must have be caught now have got to do be to wait go back dick send up man with fire arm must at once engage fellow in front occupy attention if once perceive danger will make desperate rush down here will go hard with then when have sent fighting men up see that teamster move waggon to highest piece of ground can find in valley let arrange waggon there a closely a will pack keep animal well round flood will destroy enemy be not sure that may not destroy too now hurry away tell fighting men to run up a quick a can when have seen everything in readiness join tom warn to be ready to fall back to waggon a soon a flood come dick ran down ravine be not until issued from that be aware how tremendously rain be pouring down in defile have be conscious only of slight mist with occasional drop of heavy rain for very few of rain drop entered gap far above descended to bottom almost striking against side in comparatively open valley however rain be coming down in perfect cataract dick at once sent fighting men to front three minute later report of musketry told that be engaged with enemy dick now set to work with ten of native to select spot on to place waggon bottom of valley be very flat sand between boulder showed that when water be high whole be covered however found spot on left hand side about midway between two defile be foot higher than rest hill side behind at point rose somewhat le abruptly than elsewhere be probable that rise in bottom be formed by slip have taken place at past period here waggon be arranged side by side in two row wheel of three inner waggon close against slope above cattle be gathered closely round dick then joined tom whom found in high spirit hunter having already told that flood must very soon come to relief party be hotly engaged about thirty forty yard intervened between enemy who crouching behind rock be shooting arrow high into air so that came down almost perpendicularly upon defender one of have be killed three severely wounded by missile while must only get occasional shot at limb exposed beyond shelter of boulder not having received order to stay by tom dick retraced step up valley to party above from cliff at side of valley waterfall be leaping down stream of water be already beginning to flow down centre bed of defile be perfectly dry stone being scarcely wetted by fine mist from above dick found mr harvey native engaged in keeping up hot fire at top of obstacle lying at distance of forty fifty yard from among rock one two dead native be stretched on top of rock rest be not to be seen arrow whistled fast over head showing that be lying down just behind rain be tremendous outside dick said a joined mr harvey can have idea what be here water be pouring so fast into valley that stream be forming there already will soon be running two three foot deep down lower pas wonder have not begun to make way down from above have begun dick look at little thread of water between stone when come will come with rush be always way with gorge jumbo be listening will come with roar like thunder have just told have better send most of men back at once keeping only four five to continue firing to last moment see enemy who be there on sort of platform will not notice water be making way down see how fast rise be ankle deep already tell will have to run when time come native with exception of jumbo two other men be sent back see anything to fire at dick said mr harvey agreed be pure waste of ammunition except that occupies attention can hardly be conscious how tremendously be raining if be must not remain where be must make rush upon however great risk listen jumbo exclaimed suddenly listened be conscious of dull heavy roaring sound jumbo leapt to foot come said run for life started up took to heel terrible yell be heard behind glancing over shoulder a turned corner dick saw native climbing down from defence even leaping from top in terror fast a dick be running roar behind rose louder louder quick dick mr harvey shouted will be too late dick hurried to utmost stream be already rising rapidly be running knee deep between stone stumbling slipping cutting against rock dick struggled on mighty roar be now close behind seemed to like of heavy train at full speed reached mouth of ravine water be already up to waist mr harvey jumbo dashed in seized by arm dragged out run said be not fifty yard from mouth when dick looking round saw mighty wall of water fifteen foot high leap from pouring a from huge sluice gate into valley did not stop running until joined rest gathered by waggon tom party be already there for rising water have soon warned assailant of danger fire have suddenly ceased already greater part of valley be covered with water down centre of foaming torrent be flowing here there must be seen numerous dark object knew be body of indian who have defended upper defile caught before must reach mouth by wall of water from above have instantly be dashed lifeless against rock boulder not one must be seen to make towards comparatively still water on side of centre stream driven back again by narrow entrance to lower defile water in valley rose rapidly a with ever increasing violence poured in from above there be rushing out in solid dark brown cataract dick judged to be fully forty foot in height in quarter of hour from first outburst water have already reached foot of standing upon little knoll of ground in valley ox lowing stamping with terror pressed more more closely together young ostrich be placed in one of waggon for although height must have left head well above water must probably have succumbed to effect of prolonged submersion of body if go on like for quarter of hour mr harvey said ox will be washed away if not waggon thank god think can manage to climb up slope jumbo tell men to load with five six day provision let dozen take box of ammunition a many bale of best cloth let rest take a many bundle of best ostrich feather a can carry let lay on slope twenty thirty yard up wherever can find place for then come down again make a many trip with best good a can hand worked hard inch by inch water rose mr harvey assisted by boy teamster fastened rope together with surrounded closely packed throng of cattle water be now more than waist deep be still rising soon cattle on outside be lifted off foot there be current here floated with head on back of in front of higher higher water rose till whole of cattle be afloat at first few struggled soon subsided into quiet whole mass floated together with only head above water on available ledge on hillside be placed bundle bale of kind here white native stood watching progress of flood thunder shower have ceased soon after water first burst through gorge mr harvey knew that hour must elapse before flood must begin to abate see why water must not run off a fast a come in dick said depends dick upon question whether in lower defile there be place narrower than mouth through water be rushing from above according to appearance be so for must water escape faster than come in lake here must cease to rise think now water have reached level where outflow nearly equal inflow have be watching wheel of waggon for last ten minute think have risen above inch two will get down watch dick said scrambled down to water edge two minute later shouted up have not risen at since came here teamster have taken station on outside waggon continued to talk shout to ox exhorting to be patient quiet a if animal be capable of understanding word said for three hour there be change in situation then thought that there be slight decrease in height of torrent of water pouring from defile hour later slight distinct subsidence in level of water must be perceived in hour have fallen foot after that fall be rapid steady deep roar caused by rushing torrent rumbling of huge boulder rock swept along in narrow defile gradually subsided soon bullock be again standing on foot native set to work to wash away thick sediment flood have left on floor of waggon before good be repacked few sign of recent flood now remained in valley stream still rushed through centre trunk branch of tree lay here there a water have left body of twenty thirty native be lying amongst rock in place willow pool remained in others be sheet of glistening mud will have more trouble with native mr harvey said fighting men of tribe must have be nearly annihilated do think that below be caught a well a above certainly mr harvey answered water went down with speed of race horse have only few minute start must have be overtaken before must have even gained lower bed of gorge can journey on peacefully now have be fortunate indeed have only lost one man three who be hit with stone be likely to do well have not lost single bullock bale of good will have hard work to get waggon up place where native made stand tomorrow be quite likely mr harvey said that obstacle there no longer exists flood like of to day must carry away anything look at great block of must weigh more than hundred ton likely enough of have formed part of great pile have already sent tony blacking up defile to see how flood have left in hour will be back to report hunter on returning brought good news that great block have be removed so far a have explored no other of importance have be found said indeed that defile be now more open than of two gorge have already passed through be very satisfactory for have have enough of lifting heaving rock hand be cut wounded limb ached with strain have undergone next morning at daybreak caravan started hunter report of state of road be fairly borne out although difficulty be met with be unnecessary to unyoke ox although of course many boulder have to be cleared away to allow to pas on emerging at upper end of defile found be in valley opened out to great width rose in gradual slope at head to crest of hill a only egress at lower end be by defile be clear that whole rainfall must make way by exit fully accounted for tremendous torrent have witnessed two day travelling brought to foot of slope on other side of range of hill be soon engaged in carrying on considerable trade with native there for three month travelled slowly through country by end of time have disposed of good waggon be filled to tilt with

english have be shot down in various place without smallest cause openly declare intention of recovering independence english store be for most part tabooed thing altogether look very threatening there be mere handful of british troop in transvaal only regiment so in natal wretched duffer at home hurried soldier out of country instant fighting be over if boer really mean business will have end of trouble see have crushed two enemy zulu secoceni now that have done work for want to get rid of thought must have trouble with mr harvey said be obstinate pig headed race never must pay tax to own government must not even turn out fight when secoceni threatened to overrun country now a likely a not will fight desperately for independence be glad enough to relinquish in hour of danger what tell be nuisance have originally intended to go down through kimberley to port elizabeth changed mind decided to go back again through transvaal have come so far to east like to change plan again however suppose will be interfered with ca very well quarrel with if wo quarrel with perhaps not trader said tell have found precious difficult to keep temper several time insolence swagger of fellow be

boer a passed through street group of five six men be standing at door of store one of in loud insolent voice made remark to others before long must not have of english dog going through country remark be received with boisterous approval by others mr harvey face flushed be on point of reining in horse riding up to chastise insolent boer thought of distance of country yet before checked be clearly intention of man to force quarrel in english be sure to get disadvantage finally therefore rode quietly on with insolent laughter of dutchman ringing in ear lad be equally indignant be only example of mr harvey have restrained thing have come to pretty pas mr harvey said a dismounted that englishman must be openly insulted in way however suppose will not do to resent for scoundrel must clearly be only too glad of excuse to shoot down if sort of thing be going on at village pas through will have hard work in keeping temper until be fairly out of transvaal pity countryman who have bought land setup store in country be never fond of boer though be willing to allow that be splendid set of men that be magnificent rider good shot question if will ever retain against will of course if have government worked with energy decision must be different matter altogether there be considerable number of english scotch settler already here native must rise against dutch to man if called upon to do so if couple of dozen of ringleader be promptly seized shot there must be end to whole matter know what will be native will not be encouraged even allowed to rise soldier who can hardly hit haystack at hundred yard will be shot down at distance by boer likely enough will meet with serious disaster then english government will get frightened make term fellow demand chapter sixteen fight with boer for time continued journey meeting everywhere with grossest incivility on part of boer in many place be refused water at farm warned at once off land mr harvey have greatest difficulty in keeping own temper restraining boy from resenting language of boer one day a be riding along two boer on horseback halted on eminence near road addressed taunting remark to made answer continued way

if push on straight for standerton will be overtaken probably killed before get there bullock head be turned towards southeast at best pace team be driven across country several large native kraal be passed in course of day after march of nearly double ordinary length caravan halted for night on bank of stream sharp watch be kept night nothing particular happened just a be about to inspan ox in morning fifteen twenty men be seen approaching at gallop ox be at once driven again to laager man seized arm dutchman halted at distance of hundred yard then three of rode up to caravan what do want mr harvey said advancing on foot in front of waggon while lad three hunter stood rifle in hand behind summon to surrender boer said have murdered mr van burer wounded mr schlessihoff have done nothing of sort mr harvey answered be going quietly along road when men insulted passed on without answering after have gone hundred yard fired at narrowly missed killed one of men fired back with result have named be quite ready to answer for conduct when get to leydenberg will at once deliver up to magistrate report what have occurred can then bring charge want to make against will never get to leydenberg boer said scoffingly be magistrate judge want english law here once for will surrender certainly will not mr harvey replied if molest will be at peril without word boer turned horse head rode back to comrade upon joining whole rode little distance to rear then divided half turning to left other to right what on earth be going to do dick asked in surprise be going to surround mr harvey said will dismount leave horse in shelter now lad out with bale of skin pile up under waggon hand set to work soon under waggon thick breastwork of bale be erected reaching nearly up to floor leaving only enough space to see out of fire three white hunter took station one under waggon teamster other native being distributed round square quickly a have laboured preparation be not complete when from brow at distance of about hundred yard from laager shot be fired bullet burying with thud in one of bale of skin almost instantly from point in circle round other shot be fired splintering of wood dull sound a shot struck barricade told how accurate be aim mr harvey order have be throw away shot when see flash of rifle aim steadily at point next time head be lifted to take aim hit native be ordered on account to fire unless boer attempted to close to lie quietly under shelter of defence in consequence of order not shot replied to first volley of boer when second round commenced puff of smoke darted from beneath waggon dick tom knew that shot have be successful for head at have aimed lay clearly in view discharge came from rifle pointed towards other shot must have passed near mark after first exhibition of shooting power of defender boer became much more careful firing only at interval shifting ground time before raised head to take aim so whole day passed dropping fire being kept up on side defender be convinced by end of day seven eight of boer have fallen place have be more than filled by new comer who have be seen galloping across plain towards scene of conflict on side of defender casualty have occurred towards evening fire died away tom dick joined mr harvey what will do next know dick boer be by mean fond of exposing to danger a have be proved over over again in fight with native must have suffered already great deal more than bargained for be doubt heartily sick of job may try rush at night though question whether will do so rather imagine that tactic will be to besiege until be driven to make move then to attack by way fortunately stream be close at hand can get water for cattle still there must be end of at time other blacking now crept under waggon massa what say think best plan will be for to crawl out run to chief mangrope place twenty mile away always hate dutch refuse to pay tribute several time have sent party against always beat off blacking tell that de boer attack english that if come down help drive off give one team of fine ox come think plan be very good one blacking do think that can get through get through stupid boer easily blacking said contemptuously very well blacking then a soon a be dark have better start blacking nodded withdrew hour afterwards stole out from camp a soon a night fell boer opened fire again time aiming entirely at end of waggon nearest water evidently with intention of rendering difficult to procure water from stream mr harvey companion answered by firing at flash a hoped that rescue must arrive ere long mr harvey did not permit one to go outside shelter to fetch water a animal have be watered in morning first thing must if necessary hold out until following night just a daylight be breaking tremendous yell be heard followed by hasty discharge of musket then there be sound of horse hoof galloping at full speed then headed by blacking two to three hundred native came up to camp chief be among mr harvey have on several occasion traded with now thanked warmly for welcome aid have brought boer be already far away man having run to horse galloped off panic stricken at sudden attack ox be at once inspanned two being taken from team presented to chief together with large bale of cotton in return for assistance caravan then started after march of sixteen hour arrived at leydenberg be awful nuisance dick said to tom on march being obliged to come round here if everything have gone straight calculated that might be at home by christmas eve now goodness only know when will arrive for a likely a not may be kept here for day over row with boer moment arrived at leydenberg mr harvey accompanied by two lad three native hunter went to house of magistrate gentleman have just finished dinner on being told that visitor business be urgent asked to be shown in hunter remained outside lad followed mr harvey into house have come to make complaint against boer trader said then can tell beforehand magistrate put in mission be vain one outside town have not at present slightest authority complaint reach on side of outrage perpetrated by boer upon english settler trader strong armed party be moving about country although will of course hear anything that have got to say with view of obtaining redress when thing settle down again can not hold out hope of being able to take action at present have scarcely come to sir with idea of obtaining redress rather of stating case in case boer must bring complaint against trader then proceeded to relate circumstance have occurred wanton attack upon in first place murder of one of servant killing of one wounding of other of aggressor subsequent attack upon camp relief by mangrope think have got remarkably well out of affair although attack of boer have cost life of one of follower twelve ox a have killed eight ten of have made matter more than even have moreover given lesson may be useful will take down deposition a be a well that friend here hunter speak of must testify to be hardly likely that will hear more of matter boer be clearly in wrong in case must not be likely at present moment when country be in state very closely approaching insurrection to seek redress in english court fortunately men of th regiment leave here to morrow morning on way to pretoria road will for distance be same a yours colonel be at present moment in next room with several of officer will request permission for waggon to follow baggage train thus can keep with until road separate by time will be well out of district of boer who attacked will suppose go through utrecht keep eastern road a will be shorter than going round by standerton newcastle if will wait here for few minute will speak to colonel in short time magistrate returned saying that mr harvey six waggon might join baggage train of th on following morning at eight o'clock th marched from leydenberg mr harvey waggon fell in rear of column a have considerable amount of baggage store column must not proceed at faster rate than ordinary pace of bullock train when column be once on march colonel rode down line entered into conversation with mr harvey lad who be riding with after having heard narrative of fight with boer said to lad have have baptism of fire early mr harvey smiled have have very much more serious fighting in country north of limpopo besides be present at isandula kambula ulundi indeed colonel said then have seen fighting perhaps will ride on with to head of column again have long day march before if young friend will give of experience will while away time four cantered together to head of column where doctor one two other officer be riding after word two of introduction colonel asked lad to tell how came to be at isandula how escaped to tell tale have better tell dick tom said be better hand at talking than dick accordingly proceeded to relate adventure during zulu war story excited great interest among officer when column halted for day colonel invited mr harvey lad to dine at mess must not listen to excuse on ground that clothes be better suited for travelling among native tribe than for dining at regimental mess dinner be very pleasant one after cloth have be removed cigar be lit mr harvey at colonel request related adventure north of limpopo life be indeed adventurous one said when trader have finished need endurance pluck coolness steady finger on trigger may truly be said indeed to carry life in hand present journey have be exceptionally adventurous one mr harvey said must not suppose that be often in habit of fighting way have indeed on several occasion be in very perilous position other evening before separate will be glad if will interest to relate one two of by way colonel said when took leave remember word for night be newcastle ' will probably be challenged several time by sentry before get to waggon for although there be absolute insurrection at present there be saying when boer may break out will hardly think of attacking body of troop marching peaceably along still be a well to neglect precaution if be challenged who come there ' will reply friend sentry will then say advance give word walk forward say newcastle will pas right march be continued for four day at end of time arrived at spot where direct road for pieter maritzburg through utrecht left be following look here lad mr harvey said road will take considerably out of way if like can follow column for couple of day will then cross south road can there leave gallop on by yourselves to standerton in one day home next will take back by rd whereas if go on with will not be back by new year day be getting now to part of colony where english element be pretty strong boer be not likely to be troublesome so will have difficulty in passing down with waggon can tell father that have have most satisfactory trip expect when have sold good at durban will have good reason to be content lad gladly accepted offer be longing to be at home again especially wished to be back by christmas colonel on hearing of arrangement heartily invited lad to mess with regiment for time that continued with offered to have spare tent pitched for accommodation chapter seventeen terrible journey that evening mr harvey lad be again invited to dine at mess after dinner colonel asked mr harvey if must be good enough to tell of adventure in interior have have so many trader said that hardly know must be most interesting have be many time attacked by native know that of affair be so interesting a fight have in defile other day of worst adventure have to go through be occasioned by want of water have have several of worst be one befell on one of earliest trip up country on occasion did not a usual accompany father went with trader named macgregor scotchman a father be ill at time considered too young to go by when proposed to macgregor must join with usual number of waggon sent up macgregor objected saying have doubt with justice that double amount of good must be more than must be disposed of added however that must be glad if must accompany with couple of waggon be a turned out very good thing for father that venture be such small one macgregor be keen trader understood native character well be generally very successful in venture failing be that be obstinate pig headed man very positive in own opinion distrusting advice given trip have be successful one penetrated very far in interior disposed of good when have done so started to strike down to kimberley across little known very sandy district native among whom be endeavoured to dissuade macgregor from making attempt saying that season be very dry one many of pool be empty that there must be greatest difficulty in obtaining water macgregor disregarded advice by taking direct route south must save hundred of mile said that other caravan have at different time taken route in safety at same time of year insisted that season have not be particularly dry one that be not going to be frightened by old woman tale native be always croaking about something did not mean to lose month of time for nothing accordingly started really bad part of journey be about mile across sandy country with low scrub bullock when driven to must eat leaf of scrub so that did not anticipate difficulty in way of forage in wet season many stream run across country find way into limpopo in summer dry up water be only obtained in pool along course there be twelve waggon in caravan ten belonging to macgregor two have with servant native who have be for year in employment of father very faithful trustworthy fellow at end of first day march of fifteen mile found water at spot to native guide led second day pool be found to be dry got there early having started before daybreak for heat be tremendous on finding pool empty rode ten mile down course of stream macgregor a far up found water on getting back to camp ox be inspanned made march here found water halted next day so went on until be half way across desert several of march have be double one track be heavy from deep sand of ox have died be much reduced in strength although macgregor be not man to allow that have be wrong saw that be anxious before advancing sent on horseman native guide two day journey to see how water held out on return reported that twenty mile in front there be pool of good water that thirty mile farther there be small supply be however rapidly drying up macgregor determined to push on first day march be got through although five six more ox dropped by way second be terrible march have never known hotter day in south africa one felt blinded crushed by heat weakened team must scarcely draw waggon along by journey have be performed ox be turned loose allowed for hour two to crop bush then be inspanned again night long continued march when just at sunrise got to place where water have be found pool be empty two day sun since horseman have be there have completely dried up set to work to dig hole sand be willow rock lying foot two below only got few bucket of water just enough to give swallow to of ox horse again searched far up down course of stream without success dug innumerable hole in bed without finding water be still fifty mile from safety in fifty mile native said that did not think drop of water must be found a be notoriously driest point on route ox have now died macgregor determined to leave two of waggon behind to harness team of strongest of remaining to drive rest alongside halted till night to allow animal to feed then started got on fairly enough until daybreak then sun rose poured down upon be terrible day one spoke creaking of wheel of waggon be only sound to be heard mile went number lessened a bullock lay down to die by way tongue seemed to cleave to roof of mouth sun to scorch up brain hardly took notice of what be going on around let rein hang loose on horse neck several time stumbled at last fell heavily picked up from sand saw that be dying waggon have come to standstill now have saw for last quarter of mile gone on alone looked at watch be four o'clock turned walked slowly back to waggon driver have unroped ox most of lay where have halted incapable of rising to foot others have tottered to shade cast by waggon have thrown down there driver be lying among a came up macgregor staggered towards be chewing handful of leaf have be wrong harvey said in hoarse voice have cost life say forgive boy ' forgive heartily ' said thought be for best remember much more lay down wondered vaguely what have become of man whom have not seen since started on previous evening next thing remember be that be night got up on foot staggered to bullock heard faintly groaning cut vein in neck sucked blood then started to walk fortunately a turned out have not gone hundred yard when dizziness came over fell again to ground must have lain there for hour when became conscious water be being poured between lip soon recovered sufficiently to sit up found that be faithful man when caravan started from last halting place have seen that be impossible for to reach journey end although like rest be exhausted worn out have started at full speed alone by morning reached water having travelled fifty mile in night be midday before succeeded in finding native kraal then by promise of large reward induced forty men laden with heavy skin of water to start with at three in morning reached camp fortunately stumbled across just before got there assistance arrived in time two of driver be found to be dead macgregor other hand sixteen in number be brought round supply carried by native be sufficient to give ample drink to eighteen ox be still alive feed of maize be then given to a be too weak to drag even one of waggon be driven on ahead most of got over twenty five mile still separated from water halted there week to allow animal to recover then carrying skin of water for supply on way went back brought in two waggon one at time with came down to colony macgregor remained behind directly rain set in went up with native cattle brought down other waggon valuable content of however have in intervening time be carried off by native be near squeak be macgregor be never same man again shortly after return to natal sold off waggon went back to scotland being young strong soon recovered from privation lion be very abundant in part of interior be not mr harvey one of officer asked after have thanked trader for story extraordinarily so mr harvey replied in fact have long be puzzle among how such vast quantity must find food in other country in world must do so here abundance of deer be so great that lion be able to kill vast number without making great impression upon must not have thought officer said that lion must run down deer can not mr harvey said except for short distance south african lion be lighter more active beast than northern lion can for first hundred yard run with prodigious swiftness taking long bound like cat stealing through long grass keeping to leeward of herd will crawl up to within short distance unperceived then with dozen tremendous bound be among before have fairly time to get up full speed hunt too in regular pack twenty thirty of will surround herd gradually lessening circle close upon affrighted prey who stand paralysed with fear until lion be fairly among be once surrounded by have very narrow escape of life have left waggon at large native village have ridden accompanied only by native servant fifty mile across country to tribe to see whether have lately be visited by trader whether have good to dispose of reached kraal in morning palaver with chief a usual wasted best part of day be nearly dark when started be accustomed to ride by light of star have fear of missing way have be only two hour on road when sky became overcast hour later tremendous storm burst having now index for directing way found that be useless to proceed plain be open knew that goodsized river ran short distance to north so turned horse head in direction knowing that on river bank be likely to meet with tree several time missed way in driving rain for wind shifted frequently be of course only guide have at last to great satisfaction struck upon river kept along bank until came to large clump of tree here unsaddled horse picked out comparatively dry spot under big tree stood just at edge of river wrapped ourselves in rug prepared to pas night a comfortably a must river be high only fear be that might overflow bank set afloat before morning however have not be there long before rain ceased sky cleared star came out again a horse have done long day work on previous day determined to remain where be until morning having be in saddle previous night slept heavily wind be still blowing strongly suppose that noise in tree lapping of water by bank close by prevented hearing stamping of horse under ordinary circumstance must certainly have warned of approaching danger suddenly awoke with terrific uproar sprang to foot be instantly knocked down beast knew to be lion seized by left shoulder revolver be a always in belt drew out fired into brute eye jaw relaxed knew shot be fatal terrible din be going on round there be light enough for to see that horse have be pulled to ground two lion be rending body of servant others be approaching with loud roar sprang to foot climbed up into tree just a two more lion arrived upon spot servant have not uttered cry be have doubt struck dead at once horse ceased to struggle by time gained tree at least twenty lion gathered round growled quarrelled over carcase of horse when have finished walked round round tree roaring horridly of reared against trunk a if must try to climb lion be not tree climber have not much fear that must make attempt hoped that in morning must move off have clearly intention of doing so for a became daylight retired short distance then lay down sat upon haunch in semicircle fifty yard distant watching so whole day passed have only four shot left in revolver for spare ammunition be in holster of saddle even have have dozen revolver must have done nothing against at night again came up to tree in hope of frightening off descended to lower branch fired remaining shot at brute rearing up against a aimed in case at eye muzzle of pistol be within four foot of head shot be fatal only result be that lion withdrew for short distance renewed guard round tree will wonder perhaps why time did not take to water lion although like cat tribe disliking water will cross river by swimming seemed so pertinacious that feared might follow towards morning however determined on risking creeping out to end of branch overhung river dropped in stream be running strong kept under water swimming down with a hard a possibly must when came up glanced back at tree have quitted lion be gathered on bank roaring loudly lashing tail with sign of excitement looking at water where have seen disappear have not least doubt that must have jumped in after have not dived took in at glance then went under again so continued diving until be sure that be beyond sight of lion then made for bank a quickly a possible river swarmed with crocodile have not be for muddiness of water must probably have be snapped up within minute two of entering be with feeling of deep thankfulness crawled out lay down on clump of reed mile beyond spot where lion be looking for when sun got high felt sure that must have dispersed a usual returned to shelter for day therefore started on foot reached camp late at night next day got in motion when three day later arrived at kraal from have started rode over to tree recovered revolver saddle not even bone remained of carcase of horse of native attendant be very nasty adventure colonel said be common thing caravan being attacked by lion very common thing trader replied indeed in certain part of country such attack be constantly made persistency with lion in spite of severe lesson have received of deadly effect of fire arm yet continue to attack caravan be proof that must often be greatly oppressed by hunger do seem to prefer one of officer asked human being cattle kill fifty ox to one human being probably arises from fact that in lion country driver always sleep round large fire in centre of cattle think that by preference lion attack horse because be more defenceless cattle sometimes make good fight have seen when loose forming circle with head outside showing such formidable line of horn that lion have not ventured to attack once twice have seen single ox when attacked by solitary lion come out victor in assault a lion walked round round bullock continued to face have then often seen receive spring upon horn hurl lion wounded half stunned yard away once saw die together bullock with one of horn driven into lion chest while latter fixed teeth in bullock neck tore away with claw at side until fell dead together must be grand country for sport one of officer said be that trader replied wonder sometimes that gentleman in england who spend great sum year in deer forest grouse moor more often come out for few month shooting here voyage be pleasant one although journey up country to interior of course take time trip must be novel one comfort must be carried in waggon while sport when right country be reached must be more abundant varied than in other part of world lion may be met deer of numerous kind giraffe hippopotamus crocodile many other animal not to mention occasional gallop after ostrich expense must not be greater than rental keep of deer forest yes be surprised that more sportsman come out here in odd time too must get good fishing excellent trader replied of river literally swarm with fish when get back to england colonel said must advise of friend to try a say there be score of men who spend thousand year on deer forest grouse shooting horseracing must be new sensation for to come out for few month shooting in interior of africa must not tell too much of close shave that friend have have spice of danger add to enjoyment adventure that have gone through go somewhat beyond point chapter eighteen boer insurrection next morning lad bade farewell to mr harvey three hunter then rode on with regiment day passed a quietly a preceding one have done on th column be marching along road commanded on side by rising ground troop a usual be marching at ease one company be ahead of line of waggon two company marched in straggling order by side of long team fourth company formed rearguard suddenly without slightest warning flash of fire burst from edge of rise at side number of men fell scene of wildest confusion ensued of young soldier ran for shelter underneath waggon others hastily loaded fired in direction of unseen foe colonel officer strove to steady men to lead up slope to attack boer so deadly be fire of latter men fell in such number that colonel soon saw that resistance be hopeless many of officer be killed wounded by first fire in five minute after first shot be fired men be killed wounded a rest must not be got together to charge up slope under deadly fire of boer colonel who be wounded surrendered with survivor to boer two three mounted officer only succeeded in getting through when fire opened dick tom at once threw off horse unslinging rifle opened fire when saw bewilderment confusion how fast men be dropping under fire of boer dick said to friend be up tom be simply massacre will wait for minute two then mount make dash for horse be lying down beside for lad have taught to do at word of command a enabled often when out hunting to conceal in slight depression from sight of approaching herd of deer thus a well a master remained untouched by storm of bullet boer almost concealed from view steadily picked off men be of use tom let mount make bolt for must surrender in few minute not man will be left alive gave word to horse leaped to foot a be habit in chase dashed off at full speed instant master be in saddle bending low on neck of horse lad rode at top of speed several bullet came very close to keeping closely side by side to lessen mark presented to enemy dashed on untouched looking round when have proceeded little distance saw that four boer have mounted be in hot pursuit horse be good one in capital condition have done easy work for last few day boer also be well mounted for three four mile chase continued dutch from time to time firing lad be good four hundred yard ahead distance beyond at boer be accustomed to shoot gun will carry with accuracy must stop dick said a breasted ascent if must happen to hit one of horse must be up with dismount tom a soon a be over rise a soon a be out of sight of pursuer reined up horse dismounted again made animal lie down throwing behind rested rifle upon boer have noticed be not together two of being about fifty yard ahead of others at full speed leading pursuer dashed for rise a came fairly in view be fifty yard distant lad horse be almost hidden in long grass boer did not for moment notice when did instantly reined in horse be too late lad have rifle fixed upon two shot rang out together boer fell lifeless from saddle dutch horse dashed back along track by have come lad instantly reloaded waited in vain for coming of other pursuer on seeing horse galloping towards after shot have be fired have at once turned rode off after waiting for little time to be sure that be not going to be attacked friend mounted rode on did not retrace step to see what have become of other pursuer a be possible that have imitated own tactic be lying down by horse waiting to get shot at must ride back now continued journey at easy canter late in evening entered little town of standerton standerton presented scene of unusual excitement team of waggon filled street armed men moved about talked excitedly number of cattle horse under charge of kaffir occupied spare place near town be exodus loyal boer who be at time in absolute majority throughout colony be many of moving across frontier to escape conflict saw approaching more enlightened among people have be fully conscious of short coming of own government prior to annexation to england short a have be period have elapsed since event benefit have accrued to country have be immense value of land have risen fourfold english trader have opened establishment in village dutch obtained far higher price than before for produce with corresponding reduction in of article have to purchase peaceable men be no longer harassed by being summoned to take part in commando levy for expedition against native feeling of insecurity from threatening attitude of zulu other warlike neighbour be at end a be danger of general rising among native in colony who outnumbered boer by ten to one thus wiser head among

abandoned farm either retired into natal assembled in town formed with trader there into corp for defence manner in throughout war little body uniformly succeeded in repulsing attempt of boer to capture town showed how easily latter must have be defeated have british government acted with energy when sufficient force have be collected on frontier instead of losing heart surrendering at discretion be not too much to say have british government stood altogether aloof colony of natal with english settler loyal boer must single handed have put down insurrection in transvaal news lad brought to standerton of unprovoked attack upon massacre of th caused wild feeling of excitement crowd rapidly gathered round lad so great be anxiety to hear what have taken place that dick be obliged to mount on waggon to relate whole circumstance to crowd englishman living at home in happy conviction that own be greatest of nation can form little idea of feeling of men in colony like cape where

at home news of bloody massacre at time when hostility have not commenced on side when overt act of rebellion have taken place caused eye to flash blood to run hotly in men vein who have hitherto

south africa be involved in civil war there be much in view of case have strong corp of colonist be attached to force of general colley be pretty certain that must have escaped disaster subsequently befell for being for most part excellent shot accustomed to chase must have met boer with own tactic thus a english settler in garrison in transvaal showed far better fighter than dutch antagonist so natal where large number of young colonist have served against zulu secoceni moirosi in other native trouble must if permitted have furnished contingent must have entirely altered complexion of

drove off at leydenberg fifty men of th under lieutenant long have be left when four company under colonel anstruther have marched away people of town when news of rising arrived offered to defend with troop against attack lieutenant long declined to accept offer there be in town woman child only thirty four white men who must be relied on there be defence water supply a lieutenant long knew three four month must elapse before relieving force must arrive decided that must only cost townspeople life property be to attempt to defend place therefore advised to remain neutral while with fifty soldier defended fort did commandant of boer force piet steyn caused property to be respected when entered town with troop for three month lieutenant long defended fort gallantly against attack at one time enemy set fire to thatch roof of one of building soldier succeeded in extinguishing although boer kept up heavy fire during night defender stripped off roof of remaining thatch building so prevented renewal of form of attack boer cut off water supply garrison sunk well succeeded in reaching water in time casualty among fifty men during siege be three killed nineteen wounded at end of war general order be published conferring highest praise upon lieutenant long little garrison for bravery endurance have shown in maintaining for three month close siege without hope of relief succour

house sixty men of th under captain brook formed garrison be stationed there to keep order after secoceni war a le than native inhabit surrounding district fortunately race be being held at time when

boer attacked in considerable force having with two cannon fort held out until end of war garrison making many sortie when boer brought up gun too close at rustenberg wackerstroom successful defence be also maintained throughout war by british loyalist incident of importance marked siege of place chapter twenty laing neck on th of january general colley little column consisting of th battalion of th small naval brigade mounted infantry six gun moved out from newcastle took with amount of baggage train altogether out of proportion to force a in addition to own baggage ammunition be taking up considerable amount of latter for use of troop besieged in various town in transvaal mr humphreys jackson rode over to newcastle to see start lad sat chatting to on horse a column filed by like look of thing father dick said if have seen way boer polished off th be sure must like either if be attacked by troop must for most part be wanted to guard huge baggage train be sure from what have seen of boer only way to thrash be to attack quickly suddenly if let attack be done for shooting be ten time a good a of troop be accustomed in hunting in native war to depend man on must hang round column like pick men off at long distance fall upon in hollow bush while whenever fellow tried to take offensive must mount horse ride away only to return renew attack a soon a troop fell back to waggon besides with train of waggon can only crawl along boer will have time to fortify position wonder at rate that general colley doe not push forward in light marching order drive boer at once out of natal cross river into transvaal then must have flat open country before must bring waggon up afterwards what say seems right enough dick father answered general colley have reputation of being excellent officer have doubt that be excellent officer father have have experience whatever in boer style of fighting know that have often be defeated by native fancy doe not value highly enough can not stand quick sudden attack be how native sometimes defeat at own game of shooting from behind rock believe that be more than match for regular troop however will see a be not going a combatant will be able to look on quietly fortunately boer be not like zulu there be fear of non combatant prisoner being massacred if there be tell fairly father must cry off let waggon go without for do believe that thing will not turn out well well hope be wrong dick have seen so much fighting in country during last two year that opinion be certainly worth something however there be one satisfaction there be number of troop now landing at durban on march up so that if little force doe get check will soon be retrieved now good bye lad mind if there be attack on waggon take a little part in a can stick to position of non combatant if must have have a volunteer must have done best a have declined to accept offer of colonist let fight out own way if get beaten boer swarm into natal a in case certainly will do colonist will take matter in hand by if send dutchman packing back faster than come be dutchman have sir george colley pushed on rapidly with column must have passed point at boer must have taken up strong defensive position before must gather in force to oppose a have choice of three four different line of advance until one by must travel be known boer army be forced to remain inactive awaiting disposition a soon however a have left newcastle be known by that have started along line of road to west of newcastle moved whole force to oppose took post on position known a laing neck at spot where road have to cross over steep difficult ridge here set to work to throw up intrenchment leisurely indeed dilatory advance of british gave ample time for although distance from newcastle to laing neck be twenty five mile column unimpeded by baggage must by forced march have seized position on very day of leaving newcastle long before boer must have moved army to reinforce little body who occupied position a corp of observation le than six day elapsed before sir george colley force arrived before laing neck time be spent in frequent halt in improving road bridging stream other similar operation useful enough in way fatal to success of flying column whose object be to strike sudden blow at enemy to secure road pass a far a frontier in order to facilitate march of main column of invasion be on way up from coast dick tom chafed under long delay twice rode home spent day with parent at last however column be in front of enemy position boer who be strong held strong position on line of crest of ridge with breastwork thrown up in front total force of sir george colley consisted of infantry together with mounted men gun to attack position with chance of success man must have be sent against intrenchment general colley however seems at last moment to have be alarmed for safety of baggage be menaced by party of boer on left flank therefore prepared to attack with only five company of th be little more than men keeping whole of rest of infantry in reserve ordering mounted infantry to assist in attack service upon such ground be altogether unfitted to perform result of such arrangement a be inevitable tom dick must scarcely believe eye when saw handful of men advancing up steep hill at whose summit be force more than ten time a numerous composed of of finest marksman in world six english gun opened fire to cover advance th went gallantly up hill a soon a approached crest tremendous fire of musketry be opened upon by boer lying behind intrenchment men be literally swept away by fire gallantly led by officer pressed forward until within few yard of breastwork then boer leapt to foot sprang over work fell upon colonel deane major poole lieutenant elwes lieutenant bailey be killed le than of little force be killed wounded taken prisoner few even of survivor must have escaped have not mounted infantry who have ascended spur at point farther to right made gallant charge along crest of hill checked pursuit main body of british advanced short distance to make demonstration prevent boer from following up success whole column then fell back four mile to ground have occupied night before gallantry displayed by th mounted infantry be sole redeeming feature in discreditable affair of laing neck where defeat have be rendered almost certain by previous hesitation delay be ensured by folly of sending mere handful of men to attack position a british fell back boer advanced at nightfall placed on road between camp newcastle entirely cutting force off from base threatening town of newcastle several day passed attitude of boer became more more threatening general colley determined at hazard to open way back to newcastle on morning of th of february moved out with five company of th rifle two field two mountain gun detachment of mounted infantry dick tom obtained leave to ride back with mounted detachment at commanding post near river ingogo sir george colley left two mountain gun company of rifle a garrison moved forward with rest of column river ingogo run at bottom of deep ravine crossing english force mounted to top of opposite crest have gone short distance farther when be attacked on side by boer troop be ordered at once to take shelter among boulder bush while two gun from top of eminence opened fire with shell upon enemy dick tom sought shelter with rest making horse lie down beside be soon a hotly engaged a rifle around in answering heavy fire of boer fight began at twelve o'clock raged without intermission for six hour sometimes boer attacked on one side of position sometimes upon ground be broken thickly strewn with boulder bush favoured by boer crept up sometimes close to position held by english so accurate be shooting that none of defender must show head above shelter for moment be a much a must do to prevent enemy from carrying position at rush th fought with greatest coolness steadiness numerous a be enemy must not muster up courage for rush must have assuredly overwhelmed little party that be attacking two english gun must render small service men being shot down a fast a stood up to load officer driver gunner horse be killed wounded within hour after action commenced so incessant indeed be rain of ball that gun after action be spotted with bullet mark so thickly that must have be difficult to place tip of finger upon place unstruck by ball when darkness put stop to fight men more than two third of force be killed wounded among former be captain macgregor of staff captain green of royal artillery lieutenant green o'connell of th while lieutenant pixney parson twistlewaite haworth of th be wounded have boer taken advantage of cover of darkness to steal forward must have annihilated little force believed that have in power for rain have fallen heavily ingogo have risen be thought unfordable general colley ascertained however that be stilt possible to cross with greatest silence survivor moved off from position storm helping to conceal movement from boer very quietly moved down to stream with greatest difficulty succeeded in crossing then picking up on way company gun have be left on eminence beyond column reached camp in safety in meantime reinforcement have be pushing forward from sea a fast a possible on th column under sir evelyn wood arrived at newcastle to great joy of inhabitant for day attack by boer have be expected intrenchment have be thrown up round great convoy have be collected to advance with force inhabitant who must bear arm many settler from surrounding country have come in to aid in defence must boer attack arrival of relieving column ensured safety of town boer between newcastle general coney little camp at once fell back to old position on laing neck leaving road open general colley staff rode in from prospect hill name of camp have consultation with general wood nd regiment marched out reinforced general colley column boer position at laing neck be commanded by lofty rugged mountain called majuba hill on right occupation of hill by british must render position untenable must have be admirable military movement to seize hill when whole force be collected at camp in readiness to advance a with flank turned force advancing for direct attack boer must at once have retreated general colley most unfortunately desired to retrieve two defeat have suffered by compelling boer to fall back before arrival on scene of sir evelyn wood with main body believed doubt with reason majuba hill once captured must be impregnable against attack might be made against accordingly on night of th with twenty officer men drawn from th th nd naval brigade started from camp with intention of seizing hill night be dark one march across unknown country difficult in extreme intervening ground be cut up by steep valley rapid ascent for hour troop struggled up down place many of must have be difficult to climb by daylight at last after immense labour force reached foot of majuba hill having taken six hour in accomplishing distance a crow fly be little more than four mile at commanding point near foot of hill men be left to keep open communication main body kept on until reached summit just before daylight boer being entirely in ignorance of movement have taken place position be of immense natural strength a be only at few point that ascent must be made on summit be plateau so that troop not actually engaged in repelling assault must lie down perfectly secure from fire from below at sunrise boer must be seen moving about in line hour later party of mounted vedettes be seen trotting out towards hill during day used a post of observation a approached outlying picket fired upon a sound of gun be heard by boer below scene of greatest confusion excitement be observed from height to prevail swarm of men be seen rushing hither thither to arm to horse others to waggon to ox be at once harnessed ready for retreat in case of necessity then great portion of boer moved forward towards hill with evident intention of attacking at seven o'clock enemy opened fire bullet whistled up thickly round edge of plateau main body of troop remained in centre of plateau out of fire small body being posted near edge to answer fire of boer prevent approaching accessible point for five hour musketry duel continued so far effect have be trifling few men only being wounded position appeared perfectly safe boer be indeed between garrison of hill camp former have three day provision with must therefore hold out until sir evelyn wood arrived with main body for direct attack upon boer position between twelve one o'clock boer fire slackened besieged force thought assailant be drawing off however be not case under cover of shrub rock boer be creeping quietly up at one o'clock terrific fire suddenly broke out enemy in great number rushed up short intervening distance between scanty line of defender on edge of plateau seized by panic at once fled exulting boer poured up on to plateau opened destructive fire upon troop scene ensued be one of most discreditable in annals of british army although armed with breech loader fully a numerous a assailant who have gained crest of hill resistance offered be feeble in extreme have troop charged boer advantage of discipline of vastly superior weapon must have be irresistible must have cleared plateau a speedily a have be occupied great majority however be seized with wild panic in spite of effort of officer thought of nothing seeking safety in flight few stood fired how few be can be judged from fact that only one boer be killed one severely wounded four slightly so while british force be killed wounded taken prisoner remainder managing to escape down side of hill to join force left at foot to hide in bush until night among killed be general colley captain hon c maude surgeon major h cornish surgeon landon lieutenant trower of naval brigade eight officer be killed seven taken prisoner eighty six men be killed wounded fifty one taken prisoner two missing fight such a be lasted five minute force have be left at bottom of hill under captain robertson be also attacked being admirably led by officer fought way back to camp with small loss gun there assisting to cover retreat boy have not accompanied expedition from camp have watched line of smoke round hill have joined in laughter of officer at idea of boer attacking so tremendously strong position intense be astonishment in camp when wreath of smoke suddenly rose from summit when cleared away be quiet became evident that boer have carried position be difficult to say whether feeling of dismay humiliation most prevailed with defeat of majuba hill war in transvaal virtually terminated when news reached government declared that honour of british flag must be vindicated great number of troop be sent out to natal marched up country be in readiness to assault boer position when english government suddenly gave way granted to boer that demanded sole provision insisted upon being purely nominal sovereignty on part of queen equally nominal protection for native clause in treaty from time to attempt have be made to enforce not only be native practically abandoned to mercy of boer to be shot down enslaved at will a in former time english settler who have for month made noble defence in town in transvaal be abandoned greater portion of ruined plundered have long since left country where relying upon empty promise vain guarantee of england have embarked fortune more disgraceful humiliating chapter in english history than war in transvaal treaty concluded be not to be found after battle of majuba hill dick tom returned to farm resolved to have nothing farther to do with business there have remained steadily since time mr humphreys plantation of tree now cover great extent of ground promise fully to answer expectation of eventual profit first planted be attaining large size thinning brings in considerable annual income waggon be fully employed in taking down fruit to pieter maritzburg in ten year mr humphreys expects that will be very wealthy man be thinking next year of paying visit with wife two son to england where john will be left to finish education pas through college with view of eventually entering church dick be quite contented with life have taken farther part in trading expedition into interior although profit realised in venture under mr harvey be considerable there be plenty of work on farm to occupy time large number of native be employed in planting operation since first year mr humphreys have raised own tree from seed breeding of cattle horse have be abandoned only small herd flock of sheep being kept for home requirement a be found that ever increasing plantation great orchard of fruit tree be quite sufficient to occupy attention mr jackson too be prospering greatly influenced by example of neighbour too have gone in for planting although on much smaller scale than mr humphreys mean being insufficient to carry out such extensive operation tom dick be a great friend a ever when can be spared often go out together on deer hunting expedition tom be engaged to daughter of trader in newcastle dick laughing say that will look out for wife when get to england prospect must be altogether bright for emigrant from derbyshire be not for trouble weakness of british government in sending back cetewayo to zululand brought about from increasingly bad feeling growing up between boer native owing to constant aggression of latter ill treatment of native in defiance of agreement in treaty with british government if day must come when native at last rise avenge upon boer accumulated injury of many year dick humphreys tom jackson will be inclined to lift hand to save boer from well merited fate example of successful resistance offered by basuto to whole power of cape government have have immense effect among native tribe of south africa sooner later colonist there will have very serious crisis to pas through dick hope that crisis will not occur in time for mr humphreys intends in fifteen year if live so long when first planted tree will have gained maturity to divide great forest into lot to sell off to return to native land dick quite agrees in plan hope day to be settled with abundant competency in old england end
