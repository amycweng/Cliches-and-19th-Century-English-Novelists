in fidelity to king over water maintaining stoutly that majesty knew nothing whatever of foul plot that cause be in way affected by misconduct of few men who happened to be among adherent at lynnwood thing went on a usual charlie continued study in somewhat desultory way having small affection for book kept up fencing lesson diligently learned to dance quarrelled occasionally with cousin alured spent good deal of time on horseback rode over not unfrequently to rockley choosing a far a possible day hour when knew that alured father be likely to be away went over partly for own pleasure more in compliance with father wish cousin seldom come over latter said know right well that be from slackness of own that husband like not intimacy here be well then that must go over see for be only when

cantering on pony by side escorting home again before nightfall ciceley mother wondered sometimes that husband who in most matter set will in opposition to hers never offered objection to girl visit to lynnwood thought that perhaps be pleased that there must be intimacy between member at least of family sir marmaduke there be so few house at be welcome be pleasant to to be able to refer to close friendship of daughter with cousin at lynnwood beyond celia who often a sat alone turned matter over in mind must see reason must have for permitting intimacy that must permit without reason be a experience have taught out of question ciceley never troubled head about matter visit to lynnwood be very pleasant to be two year younger than charlie carstairs although when have once brought to house considered that duty be over until hour arrived for return be sometimes ready to play with escort round garden climb tree for fruit bird egg for such little courtesy never received from alured

caution a if be graybeard still lad have doubt that matter will straighten out come right in end be always most trying time for timorous heart before first shot of battle be fired once engagement commences there be time for fear battle have to be fought out best way to safety be to win victory have not least doubt that a soon a be known that king have landed there will be no more shilly willying hesitation loyal man will mount horse call out tenant in few day england will be in blaze from end to end charlie troubled little with what be going on father have promised that when time did come must ride by side with promise be content to wait knowing at present strength must be of little avail week added somewhat to weight sinew one day be in garden with ciceley weather be hot girl be sitting in swing under shady tree occasionally starting by push with foot on ground then swaying gently backward forward until swing be again at rest charlie be seated on ground near pulling ear of

who seems to be threatened by saxony a well a by denmark did not know anything about thought be rather stupid father yours seemed of one mind be a good friend a if be in equal agreement on other point what have to do with nicholson for be man name who came out just now doe not seem to have much to do with said doubtfully yet perhaps doe know mother be not quite of same opinion a father although never say so to when be alone together sometimes shake head say fear that trouble be coming make very unhappy one day be in garden be talking loudly in dining room at least be talking loudly well said know whether ought to tell charlie certainly ought not ciceley if heard what be not meant to hear ought never to say word about to anyone concern sir marmaduke can not help that said stoutly people often say thing of other in private especially if be out of temper that quite mean must make terrible mischief if such thing be repeated whatever father said want to hear must be very wrong of to repeat be not going to repeat charlie only want to say that think father yours be very friendly together be natural when father be for king william father for king james make secret of that know charlie nodded be right enough ciceley still understand in least what have to do with servant have to do with said pettishly starting swing afresh then relapsing into silence until again came to standstill think ought to know said suddenly see charlie sir marmaduke be very kind to love dearly so do think ought to know although may be nothing at well fire away then ciceley there be one thing

take one of father farm indeed there be hundred thing might want to see about still be glad have told in own mind charlie thought much more seriously of than pretended knew that at present father be engaged heart soul in projected jacobite rising knew that john dormay be bitter whig believed that have grudge against father general opinion of be that be wholly unscrupulous that must then be in secret communication with servant at lynnwood struck a very serious matter indeed charlie be not yet sixteen close companionship with father have rendered older than most lad of age be a warm jacobite a father manner in william with dutch troop have crushed great jacobite rebellion in ireland seemed to lesson that prospect of success in england be much le certain than father believed to be john dormay a adherent of william must be interested in thwarting proposed movement with satisfaction of at same time bringing sir marmaduke into disgrace charlie must hardly believe that cousin must be guilty of setting spy to watch father be certainly possible a thought matter over a rode back after escorting ciceley to home resolved to keep sharp watch over doings of man nicholson must never do to tell father what ciceley said must bundle fellow out neck crop perhaps break of bone then must be traced to have not happy home a be must be far worse if father knew that be who have put on guard must

although harry knew road be little better than sheep track well enough during day father thought might find difficult if not impossible to follow on dark night congratulated upon precaution taken before have gone very far for there be moon sky be overcast drizzling rain have begun to come down must hardly see horse head have proceeded short distance when became necessary for guide to light torch took therefore over two hour to reach mountain farm be expected otherwise household must have be asleep mr jervoise have a soon a determined upon going there sent off man on horseback who riding fast have arrived before night set in there be therefore great turf fire glowing on hearth when arrived hearty welcome awaiting from farmer wife daughter harry have by father advice brought two change of clothes in valise be so completely soaked to skin that decided must after drinking horn of hot spiced ale have be prepared for go at once to bed where in spite of stirring event of day went off to sleep a soon a head touched pillow sun be shining brightly when woke mist have cleared off although still hung round head of ingleborough six mile away on of other hilltop change of weather have inspiriting effect went down to breakfast in brighter more hopeful frame of mind a soon a meal be over harry started for home hope wo be long before can see again harry charlie said a stood by horse hope not indeed there be saying father order be that be to stay at home if people come take possession send man off to with news privately that if one come may myself bring over news there be so may be back here afternoon will be looking out for harry remember will be horribly dull for up here wondering fretting a to what be going on know charlie will hear a soon a get smallest scrap of news if be must go for good walk among hill will be much better for than moping here at rate be not likely to get news for hour to come charlie took advice started among hill not returning until midday meal be ready before have finished dinner there be tap at door then young fellow whom knew to be employed in mr jervoise stable looked in charlie sprang to foot what be news asked master harry bade tell sir that magistrate four constable ten soldier men came today at nine o'clock have returned half hour when rode up have order for arrest of mr jervoise have be searching house high low for paper one

bade return at once a later on may want to send again be to be most careful that one must see when got back if be caught be on account to say where have be to farmer insisted upon young fellow sitting down at table taking food before started to go back required pressing a soon a hunger be satisfied started again at brisk run kept up a long a charlie eye must follow down valley although boy by mean wished mr jervoise to be involved in father trouble charlie must not help feeling certain amount of pleasure at news thought certain that if father escaped must have to leave country that must in case take a companion in flight if mr jervoise harry also left country must be vastly more pleasant for father where must go to what must do have idea seemed to that exile among stranger must be bearable if have friend with must not last many year for surely often talked of landing must not be very much longer delayed then must return share in triumph of stuart cause resume life at lynnwood reckon with who have brought foul charge against that jacobite cause must fail to triumph be contingency to charlie did not give even thought have be taught that be just holy cause school friend a well a gentleman who visited father be firm adherent of believed that same sentiment must everywhere prevail there be then nothing troop of william to reckon with must hardly oppose rising of english people backed by aid from france be not until after dark that messenger returned master harry bade tell sir that gipsy boy have never seen before have brought little note from father will not return at present if mr harry can manage to slip away unnoticed in afternoon tomorrow be to come here be not to come direct to make circuit lest must be watched followed may be that master will meet here charlie be very glad to hear harry must of course give little news of what be going on outside house mr jervoise might be able to tell something about father especially a have said have mean of learning went on in lancaster jail be longing to be doing something seemed intolerable to that must be wandering aimlessly among hill while father be lying in lancaster with charge affecting life hanging over what must do knew not anything must be better than doing nothing mr jervoise have seemed to think that be out of question to attempt rescue from lancaster surely if must get together forty fifty determined fellow sudden assault upon place might be successful then set to work reckoning up groom younger tenant son of older one jotted down name of twenty seven who thought might join in attempt if harry must get twenty three from people must make up to number said of course know what difficulty to be encountered may be have ridden there with father know that castle be strong one did not notice very particularly first thing to do will be to go examine closely doubt ladder will be required must make rope ladder take into town in cart hidden under faggot something of sort do hope mr jervoise will come tomorrow be horrible waiting here in suspense next morning hour seemed endless dozen time went restlessly in out walking little distance up hill rising from valley returning again with vain idea mr jervoise might have arrived still more slowly did time appear to go after dinner be getting into fever of impatience anxiety when about five o'clock saw figure coming down hillside from right be too far away to recognize with certainty by rapid pace at descended hill have little doubt that be harry at once started at top of speed to meet doubt be soon changed into certainty when few hundred yard up hill met friend be almost breathless harry be first to gasp out have father arrived not yet harry threw down on short grass with exclamation of thankfulness have run nearly foot of way said a soon a got breath little have awful difficulty in getting out one of constable kept in same room with followed went evidently thought might hear from father try to send message at last got desperate ran upstairs to room next mine closed locked door after know ivy grows high up wall there directly got in threw open casement climbed down by gave way two three time thought be gone stuck to managed time to get fresh hold moment be down ran along by foot of wall until got round behind made dash into clump of fir tree crawled along in ditch till thought be safe then made run for be so afraid of being followed have be at least three mile round mind now that father have arrived be in such fright that might come go before got here chapter rescue two lad walked slowly down hill together harry have heard no more than charlie have done of what be going on messenger from father be young fellow of seventeen eighteen with gipsy face appearance how have managed to elude vigilance of men on watch harry did not know have only learnt presence when a passed bush in garden sharp whisper made stop moment later hand be thrust through foliage took little note held out caught sight of lad face through leaf a leant forward said go on sir without stopping may be watching harry have thrust note into pocket sauntered on for time then returned to house there read letter with whose content charlie be already acquainted eagerly talked over what have be thinking of since have parted early on previous day discussed charlie idea of attack on lancaster jail know whether must get a many men a say charlie think must if father be in prison a well a yours be sure that most of young fellow on estate must gladly help to rescue must be different thing when came to risking life for anyone else of course know doe not seem to that fifty men must be of use at towards taking lancaster castle always seemed to tremendously strong place yes doe look so harry perhaps on examining closely one must find that be not so strong a look by long way seems to there must be way other of getting father out if there seems even least bit of chance will try may be sure will stand by charlie whatever be harry said heartily have be just like brother of course brother ought to stick to other like anything if be use of being brother daresay will know more when hear what father have to say then may see way better thank harry knew must stick by of course want to do mad sort of thing there be hurry anyhow a say when know more about may be able to hit upon sort of plan be not

in case of need be too old for fatigue hardship of campaigning must not hope at age to obtain commission in swedish service did not think of joining army sir marmaduke though warrant must do a well a most thought that might take up residence at stockholm a well a at saint germains will find many scottish gentleman there not few jacobite who like have be forced to fly besides life air must suit better than at saint germains where by account life be gay one men come to think more of pleasure than of duty moreover money will go much further in sweden than in france sir marmaduke checking horse

right good news indeed lad for twelve year have set aside half rent so that in bag in holster there be six year income interest of money laid out in good mortgage will suffice amply for want in country like sweden where life be simple living cheap money will remain untouched for use must hope fail estate be lost for time be indeed weight off mind be hope in equally good case jervoise for if

deal of be mountain land worth little fund therefore be not a large a yours amount to good round sum a hope in army in other way to earn income for myself be ample will be sorry to divert from use for intended that can not now be helped have have pleasure year by year of putting by for king use now that circumstance have changed will be equally useful to myself do know country well jervoise personally know nothing about save that sun tell that at present be travelling south sir marmaduke for last few day have be so closely studying map know name of town village on various route whither

brought with valise suit of clothes for sir marmaduke of sober cut fashion avoided large town at place where put up represented a trader travelling from midland to southern coast arrived at

several change since can first remember hope may live to see however need not talk of now indeed mr jervoise agreed may be sir marmaduke that must be better if have talked thought le of during last twelve year better for ourselves for lad might still have be ready to join majesty a soon a landed a till then must hing seems to now that must have be wiser have gone about business without worrying head to say nothing of risking about matter may not take place during life a know well enough king of france us stuart only for own convenience at heart care nothing for cause be convenient to have mean of creating trouble here of so weakening william may be that day other may suit to send over army here to fight william with aid of stuart friend instead of fighting in holland elsewhere whether may think fit to do so in one year in twenty year hence who can say be question solely of military policy stuart be simply used by french king to pull english chestnut out of fire must that have established anywhere rather than in france doe harm with vast number who must otherwise be friend at rate in england in scotland be otherwise for scotland have always be in alliance with france in england be different france have always be national foe have not charles james proved so subservient to louis william of orange must never have be crowned king there be vast number in england who must rather see stuart than dutchman on throne who will never strike blow to replace there that because will come over backed up by french bayonet well let talk of something else if time ever come to act will be ready till then can let matter sleep more so a have new life before plenty of other thing to occupy thought what be father harry asked that swede dane be going to fight about be difficult question harry there can be little doubt that denmark be in wrong king of sweden died in april death be unfortunate for power contending in europe have agreed to refer quarrel to mediation at death denmark endeavoured to obtain honour failed by mediation chiefly of swedish regency peace be concluded between france england holland in autumn of year shortly afterwards struggle between german emperor france spain be also concluded not at to satisfaction of swedish mediator while sweden be occupied in matter of pacification of europe king of denmark thought to take advantage of fact that charles of sweden be minor to press frederick duke of holstein who be in close alliance with there have long be serious difference between ruler of denmark holstein of whom be branch of oldenburg family in reference to duchy of schleswig quarrel have arisen from act of christian third of denmark who decreed that descendant of brother adolphus must govern holstein jointly with king of denmark that holstein schleswig must belong to in common making change in holstein without consent of other more foolish arrangement must not have be conceived for anyone might have foreseen that must lead to dispute trouble in fact quarrel continually arose until at peace of rosahild in duchy be adjudged to denmark holstein however never acquiesced in in there be war when holstein being defeated dane imprisoned duke christian albertus until signed renunciation of right troop be disarmed town fortress garrisoned by danish troop on release duke went to hamburg where remained till at peace of fontainebleau four year later be replaced in possession of estate right of sovereignty did not last long new trouble arose sweden england holland interested in favour of duke peace be concluded in by be confirmed in right given ten year before with full liberty to raise certain number of troop of building fortress on condition that must raise none to prejudice of denmark be of stipulation inevitably lead to trouble for afforded to denmark pretext for continual complaint interference when frederick fourth succeeded father a duke of holstein in quarrel grew so hot that denmark must have invaded holstein have not party to treaty of interfered brought about conference lasted through year negotiator appointed to settle matter be unable to arrive at conclusion following year charles of sweden who have just succeeded father furnished duke with troop to help to build fort be intended to protect frontier in case of invasion by denmark christian of denmark at once attacked captured fort levelled to ground duke being too weak to engage in war with powerful neighbour did not resent attack negotiation be continued a before in view of danger of situation necessity for monarch at head of

augustus of saxony king of poland czar of russia monarch be doubtless desirous of extending dominion at cost of sweden whose continental possession be considerable augustus be not yet very firmly seated on throne of poland there be several party opposed to united in obtaining from diet refusal to pay saxon troop augustus have brought with king doubt considered that must be employed for conquest of livonia that addition of so large territory to poland must so add to popularity that must have further trouble in kingdom charles twelfth being in ignorance of secret agreement sent embassy to russia to announce accession to throne ambassador be kept long time waiting for audience a czar be bringing war with turk to conclusion did not wish to throw off mask until be free to use whole force against ambassador be at last received civilly czar evaded taking usual oath of friendship after long delay embassy returned to sweden feeling somewhat disquieted a to intention of czar having sure knowledge of king of poland be more successful in disguising leaning towards denmark sending warmest assurance to charles requesting to act a mediator in quarrel between duke of brandenburg signing treaty of alliance with sweden while sweden have idea of triple alliance have be formed against intention of denmark to make war be evident enough for king christian be gathering great naval armament duke of holstein becoming much alarmed at preparation hastened on fortification of tonningen on eider three league from mouth garrison of place be weak one thousand swedish troop be thrown in to strengthen king of denmark complained that be breach of treaty a own preparation for war be unmistakable one must blame duke of holstein for taking step to defend territory a know christian of denmark died about time be succeeded by son frederick fourth last august commenced war by sending naval squadron to cover passage of four regiment into pomerania charles of sweden seeing holstein must be crushed by powerful neighbour called upon holland duke of lunenburg who be with sweden guarantor of treaty to enforce provision joint protest be sent to king of denmark who be informed that if invaded holstein must consider breach of treaty of altena treat a common enemy frederick replied by sending troop into duchy active operation took place until beginning of year up to time sweden have not doubted friendship of king of poland charles at first must hardly believe report received from governor of livonia that saxon troop be approaching frontier few day later however came news that be advancing against riga governor prepared for defence hastily mounted cannon on wall power of resistance however be lessened by fact that river duna be frozen over fleming who commanded saxon troop arrived before town early in february with four thousand men governor have set fire to suburb on previous day fleming be surprised to find instead of taking by surprise a have

morning till night officer receiving instruction privately from sergeant further learning word of command by standing by while men be being drilled at end of time officer men be sufficiently instructed to carry out simple movement be alone in use in day be not however until two month later that be called upon to act english dutch fleet have arrived effected junction with of sweden danish fleet have shut up in port of copenhagen be closely blockaded large army have crossed to zeeland repulsed dane who have endeavoured to prevent landing have then marched up to within sight of wall of copenhagen be preparing to besiege when king of denmark alarmed at unexpected result of aggression on holstein conceded point demanded peace be signed negotiation be carried on in holland swede be extremely angry when found that be baulked of expected vengeance on troublesome neighbour peace however left charles twelfth at liberty to turn attention to other foe to hurry to assistance of riga be beleaguered by saxon pole of narva against city russian have made several unsuccessful assault without losing hour king crossed to malmoe troop there be ordered to embark immediately in vessel in harbour then sailed to revel where swedish commander welling have retired from neighbourhood of riga force being too small to meet enemy in open field sooner have troop landed than king reviewed general welling be ordered at once to march so a to place between enemy wesenberg where large amount of provision store for use of army have be collected two lieutenant in company of captain jervoise be young scotchman of good family who have three month before come over obtained commission have at colonel request be transferred to regiment promoted to rank of lieutenant captain jervoise four officer messed together be very cheerful party indeed commander to surprise of son charlie have quite shaken off quiet somewhat gloomy manner seemed to have become quite man in active bracing life in be now embarked cunningham forbes be active young men full of life energy while boy thoroughly enjoyed roughing excitement animation of daily work sometimes slept in open air sometimes on floor of cottage meal be rough plentiful king order against plundering be very severe even when in denmark country people having nothing to complain of have brought in supply regularly here in linovia be in swedish dominion there be little to be purchased for peasantry have be brought to ruin by foraging party of russian pole there be disappointment that enemy have fallen back at approach of welling force felt sure that must not be long before met for king must assuredly lose time in advancing against a soon a army must be brought over be not however to wait for arrival of main force although cavalry only took part in first affair general welling heard that force of three thousand circassian have taken up quarter in village fifteen mile away sent six hundred horse under major patkul tisenbausen to surprise be at first successful attacking circassian set fire to village be engaged in slaughtering defender when twenty one squadron of russian cavalry came up fell upon attacking on side posting so a to cut off retreat swede however gathered in body charged russian so furiously that cut way through rank losing however many of men while major patkul officer be made prisoner king be at revel when engagement took place although few of troop have arrived be too impatient for action to wait until coming of fleet therefore marched to wesenberg with bodyguard few troop from revel at once despatched thousand men to cover frontier issued order for rest of troop to leave whole of baggage behind to take three day provision in haversack to prepare to march next morning major jamieson came into cottage occupied by captain jervoise officer late in evening have blazing fire for be now middle of november night be very sharp well jervoise what do think of order asked a seated on log have be brought in for fire have not thought much about except that be going to do long quick march somewhere where be that somewhere do think have not slightest idea must not say that be to narva certainly must not considering that have five thousand infantry three thousand cavalry of large number have be so weakened by fever a to be unfit for fighting while at narva report say there be eighty thousand russian in strongly intrenched camp well be where be going jervoise nevertheless at least be what colonel have told must have be surely jesting major may be going to push forward in direction occupy strong position until army come up must be height of madness to attack enemy in strong position just tenfold force well will see jamieson said coolly be certain that narva can not hold out much longer know that king have set heart on relieving doe seem somewhat too dangerous enterprise to attack russian at rate be direction in be going tomorrow be good seventy mile distant a say that whole country have be devastated villager have fled be evident that when three day bread meat carry be exhausted will have to get food out of russian camp if nowhere else captain jervoise laughed a did others can live for short time on horse jamieson if be hard pushed for though most of be little beyond skin bone be true cavalry be certainly scarcely fit for service welling troop have have very hard time of may thank star though did not think so at time that be kept nearly three month at malmoe instead of being here with welling do seriously think major that king mean to attack russian cunningham asked own idea be that doe cunningham can not see what else there be for to do at rate if doe may be sure that will make tough fight for cavalry showed other day that can stand up against many time number of russian if can do fancy can there be one thing very audacity of such attempt be in favour well will do best may be sure since thermopylae doubt if men have fought against longer odds next morning men fell in captain jervoise who like of rank be mounted took place at head of company little army marched away from wesenberg be dreary march to purts sight of ruined village devastated field aroused feeling of indignation fury among troop fierce longing to attack men who have so ruthlessly spread ruin through fertile country order be issued that evening that men be to husband provision a much a possible order be more strictly obeyed than such order usually be for men saw for that there be possibility of obtaining fresh supply in wasted country be well aware that there existed train of waggon horse capable of bringing up store from wesenberg there be few aged men woman remaining at purts from learned that next day march must take to very difficult pas be held by six hundred of russian cavalry together with force of infantry gun be intention of king to encamp that evening near pas when within three four mile of general meidel who have with quartermaster of army four hundred cavalry rode on ahead to choose site for camp presently saw large body of russian forager in front of sent back to king for permission to attack charles ordered army to continue march hurrying forward with of officer joined general meidel charged forager killing many taking others prisoner putting rest to flight followed close upon heel rode right up to mouth of pas in spite of heavy fire of artillery musketry opened by russian at once determined to take advantage of alarm produced by defeat of russian cavalry although darkness be now drawing on brought up of infantry artillery attacked with such vigour that russian fled after offering very feeble resistance battalion of foot be ordered to occupy pas while rest of army piled arm lay down where stood in morning be astonished at strength of position have be gained so easily defile be deep narrow rapid stream ran through ground be soft marshy few determined men must have be able to bar advance of army troop be in high spirit at result of first action against enemy be more pleased that found in russian camp sufficient provision to replace have used after hearty meal again advanced at brisk march defile be captured on evening of th november early in morning of th army reached league half from narva ordering troop to follow king rode forward to reconnoitre russian position troop be weary with long march many of who have recently recovered from fever be scarce able to drag along while great number be unfit to take part in battle until after two three day of rest officer of malmoe regiment for have taken name from camp where have be formed be gathered in group at head discussing situation most of officer be of opinion that to attack at once with men horse worn out with fatigue be to ensure destruction there be others who thought that in face of so great army a gathered in front of only hope be in immediate attack major jamieson be one of king be right said if russian army have time to form to advance against in order of battle must be annihilated at present camp be extensive one for a hear extends in great semi circle four five mile long with end resting on river can not believe that intend to attack if go straight at may possibly gain footing in intrenchment before whole army can gather to aid at point of attack will be almost surprise think king be right to attempt for be only by quick sudden stroke that can gain success over so great army halt be short one a soon a regiment have arrived at position assigned to advanced a soon a appeared on rise of ground facing intrenchment enemy opened king have already reconnoitred portion of position exposing recklessly to shot a soon a troop came up issued order for to prepare to attack in two column first however several of regiment be ordered to fall out to cut down bush make fascines to enable troop to cross ditch intrenchment be formidable one being provided with parapet armed with chevaux de frise flanked by strong exterior work while several battery have be placed to sweep ground across enemy must advance right column under general welling be to march to point nearly in centre of great semicircle while left under general rhenschild be to assault point about halfway between centre river where one of largest most powerful of enemy battery be placed king be with wing with bodyguard hoped that here might meet czar commanding in person russian emperor have however left camp morning to fetch up forty thousand men who be advancing from plescow command of army have be assumed by duke of croy swedish left wing have with battery of twenty one gun while sixteen gun covered attack on right be two o'clock in afternoon when two gun gave signal for advance hitherto weather have be fine have become gradually overcast just a signal be given tremendous storm of snow hail began set right in face of russian concealed from movement of swede for indeed be wholly unprepared believing that small force saw be advance guard of great swedish army that attack need be expected until main body arrived consequence be swede be almost at edge of ditch before be perceived column attacked with such vigour courage that in quarter of hour have gained footing in intrenchment have so filled up ditch with fascines that cavalry be able to follow russian be so astounded at sudden attack that lost heart altogether swedish left a soon a entered intrenchment swept along russian abandoning gun battery making for bridge across river unfortunately for hut be built close behind work in rear be intrenchment designed to repel assault from town terrified crowd unable to make way rapidly along over ground encumbered by hut crossed interior intrenchment thinking to make way faster through field to bridge swedish king however placed at head of bodyguard followed by rest of horse charged right upon cutting down great number driving rest before towards river while infantry kept up heavy fire upon fugitive in intrenchment panic have spread quickly russian troop nearest to bridge be already pouring over when mass of fugitive arrived pressed upon bridge in such number that speedily gave way cutting off retreat of comrade behind ignorant of result terrified crowd pushed on pressing in front of into river number of drowned be le than of who fell beneath bullet pike sabre of swede in despair russian rallied by of general now attempted to defend by occupying house barrack barricading passage between with overturned waggon fought bravely repulsed for time effort of swede darkness be now falling king hastened to spot where battle be fiercely raging a ran towards fell into morass from be rescued with difficulty leaving sword one boot behind however at once pushed on placed at head of infantry engaged in assault even presence example did not avail russian maintained position with desperate courage when became quite dark assault ceased right column have met with equal success have penetrated intrenchment defeated russian who opposed now moved to assist left wing king however seeing that russian defence must not be carried by direct assault without great loss gathered army in space between town russian intrenchment placed in position to repel attack must russian take offensive giving order at hill on enemy have principal battery must be assaulted gun here commanded intrenchment capture of position must render impossible for russian to continue defence for now separated wing of army to combine officer in command of russian right wing finding unable to cross river on broken bridge surrounded by swede sent in to surrender in course of evening two battalion of swedish guard took possession of post have be so gallantly defended king granted permission to retire with arm colour standard being given up superior officer being retained a prisoner of war broken bridge be repaired early next morning russian troop passed over left wing be after surrender of right in hopeless position for on side bridge have be thrown over river retreat be wholly cut off on learning before daybreak that right wing have surrendered too sent in to ask for term king granted freedom to return to country without standard arm filed off before officer soldier bareheaded passed over bridge number being so great that have not crossed until next morning russian lost over men killed drowned hundred forty five cannon twenty eight mortar of be new besides vast quantity of military store provision hundred fifty one colour twenty standard greater proportion of musket together with military chest duke of croy commander in chief whole of general colonel major captain fell into hand of swede a prisoner of war total loss in killed wounded of swede be under two thousand chief loss being due to desperate resistance of russian after battle be irretrievably lost may be doubted whether so complete surprising victory between army so disproportionate in force be ever before gained king have exposed throughout day most recklessly be everywhere in thick of russian bullet yet escaped without so much a scratch malmoe regiment have be with left wing suffered comparatively little loss a be one of last to enter intrenchment be only when darkness be closing in be called up to take part in attack on position held by russian never be saying that fortune favour brave more signally verified jervoise major jamieson said a sat down to rough breakfast with officer of scottish company on morning after russian surrender be true enough russian be brave too a showed at end of day fancy have scotch proverb to effect that 'fou folk come to harm ' think that be more applicable in present case major laughed fou folk relates rather to drunkenness than madness jervoise of course must do for own that whole enterprise did seem to to be absolute madness result have justified that sudden snowstorm be real cause of victory have not be for still think that must not have succeeded russian cannon certainly continued to fire be wholly at random be taken by surprise when suddenly appeared at side of ditch while be across before must gather force sufficient to defend after panic did rest commander in chief fell early into hand there be one to give order one to rally expect russian soldier gave credit for having brought on storm to cover assault by aid of malign spirit well lad how did feel when shot be whistling about did not like at major charlie said seemed such strange thing marching along in thick of snowstorm hearing rush of cannonball overhead boom of gun yet be unable to see anything rear file of company in front be uncanny feeling charlie felt be very grateful that be hidden from enemy who of course be blazing away in direction in have last seen only lost three killed twelve wounded altogether think be for most part hit by random shot well if be way king mean to carry on war will have enough of before be done sick wounded be sent into town first thing be not until russian have crossed river that king rode triumphantly into place surrounded by staff amid wild enthusiasm of inhabitant whom victory have saved from ruin massacre town although strongly fortified be not large one house be so dilapidated from effect of russian bombardment few of troop must be accommodated there rest be quartered in russian hut on th solemn service of thanksgiving for

to better treatment even if be prisoner be told sharply to mind own business be with sick wounded said a prisoner be wounded thought be matter did come to extent under control what did pig say grumbled something between teeth did not catch a thought prisoner must not be kept there long be not unaccustomed to roughing be not worthwhile pressing matter further have heard that officer have be here afternoon with flag of truce to treat for exchange doctor michaeloff said turning suddenly to charlie have not heard anything about charlie said offered captain for may consider high honour be doubt charlie said with smile suppose majesty thought a be in special service be caught be bound to get released if must be hunting party be not yes there be only king with four of officer there company of foot fifty horse think can call escort for went principally a beater rustoff missed grand chance there kelly what regiment do belong to again turned to charlie malmoe regiment company be commanded by english gentleman who be neighbour great friend of father son be ensign greatest friend men be scotch english most of scotch be good soldier scotch none better there be good many in russian service also in of austria france be always faithful to be relied upon even when native troop prove treacherous like charles of sweden there be not soldier in army like charlie said enthusiastically expects to do much doe more through winter did everything in power for riding long distance from camp to camp to visit sick to keep up spirit of men if live roughly so doe on march will take meal among soldier wrap up in cloak sleep on bare ground just a do a for bravery expose life recklessly too recklessly think seemed miracle always in front a be must have got through narva without scratch yes be bad bit of business narva other said thoughtfully why do think be beaten in horrible way be because russian be coward made gallant stand when recovered from surprise charlie agreed in first place be taken by surprise ought not to have be doctor said angrily have news two day before brought by cavalry who ought to have defended that pas did still be surprise when attacked charlie said for must not suppose that small body saw be going to assail then have cover of snowstorm did not see until reached edge of ditch of course general ought to have made proper disposition to have collected greater part of troop at spot facing instead of having strung out round that big semicircle so that when made entry be separated half be ignorant of what other be doing still even then might have concentrated between trench town order have be given general be one of first captured others waited for order never came until be too late if general who commanded on left have massed troop marched against a be attacking position held on right must have be caught between two fire be badly managed business altogether doctor michaeloff growled will do better next time will understand charles tactic better reckoned on troop did not reckon on kelly tell that must not care to change service friend be in swedish army be well satisfied with service daresay if russia have be nearer england than sweden be have landed there first must have be a glad to enter service of czar a be to join that of king charles everyone say that czar make stranger welcome that be liberal master to who serve well a to quarrel between be not old enough to be able to give opinion on though a far a be concerned seems to that be not fair thing for russia to take advantage of sweden being at war with denmark augustus of saxony to fall upon without cause of quarrel nation move le by morality than interest doctor michaeloff said calmly russia want way to sea turk cut off to south swede from baltic be smothered between when saw chance took be not good morality admit that be excuse of poor man who robs rich be human nature nation act in long run good deal like individual have not told yet doctor charlie said turning conversation whether proposal for exchange be accepted general have power to accept carstairs have to be referred to czar wish majesty must see then charlie laughed must see that be lad that release must not greatly strengthen swedish army then czar may be of opinion that none of officer who allowed to be captured by handful of men at narva must be of use to doctor michaeloff laughed that may doubtless be said of good many among charlie said individually none of captain must be blamed for mess made of perhaps not if men have be panic stricken there be officer enough to have gathered together cut way through swede doubt there be must remember doctor michaeloff that officer place be with company that be duty to think of men before thinking of supposing officer of left wing a say have gathered together cut way out czar must have have right to blame for capture of whole of men how must tell at daybreak general must not have given order for left wing to attack swede be strong enough still to have eaten up have made effort have czar be there in person will warrant must have tried that must doctor michaeloff said warmly be right there young sir czar may not be soldier at least be man be more than can be said for officer who ordered sixty thousand men to lay down arm to eight thousand be sure of charlie said man who must do a have done leave kingdom work like common man in dockyard to learn how to build ship who rule people a doe must be great man suppose must do for in england because king have real power with peter must never put up with being thwarted in plan by parliament a william be for country like russia be wonderful of course company being composed of scotchman englishman have prejudice against think wrong for entering upon war against sweden consider wonderful fellow just sort of fellow one must be proud to serve under if did not serve under charles of sweden well doctor kelly when do think czar will be here doctor did not reply michaeloff said quietly arrived afternoon did charlie exclaimed excitedly why did not tell before doctor kelly have be asked about exchange be swedish officer still here be here will be exchanged in morning have other thing to see about now must say goodnight if must ever fall into hand of people again doctor kelly doe not happen to be near ask for peter michaeloff will do can for then be really to be exchanged tomorrow doctor charlie said a doctor michaeloff left room seems like did not know have heard nothing for certain knew czar have come have not heard of decision congratulate be piece of luck charlie said thought might be month before there be exchange be very good of king to send over so quickly yes of czar to let go well see much in doctor considering that get captain in exchange for still of course might have refused must not have be civil might have done what did think of friend charlie like have pleasant face though must think have got temper of own have splendid figure look more like fighting man than doctor will write down name so a not to forget a say might be able to help if be ever taken prisoner again did not happen to be with army be always nice having friend look at difference have made to finding countryman here yes may find useful carstairs have good deal of influence still think probable that if ever must get into scrape again

have caused number of large flat boat to be constructed side be made very high so a to completely cover troop from musketry be hinged so a to let down act a gangway facilitate landing charlie be standing on bank looking at movement of saxon troop across river wondering how passage be to be effected when hand be placed on shoulder looking round saw be king who a be custom be moving about on foot unattended by of officer wondering how be to get across lieutenant be just what be thinking over majesty want snowstorm a have at narva king said wind be blowing right way there be chance of such stroke of luck at time of year sir be thinking that one might make artificial fog how do mean king asked quickly majesty have great stack of straw here collected for forage for cattle doubt good deal of be damp if not must be easily wetted if be to build great pile of along on bank here set alight so a to burn very slowly to give out great deal of smoke light wind must blow across river into face of saxon completely cover movement be right king exclaimed nothing must be better will make smoke will blind half smother hurried away hour later order be sent out to regiment a soon a became dusk men must assemble at great forage store for fatigue duty a soon a did so be ordered to pull down stack to carry straw to bank of river there pile in heavy mass twenty yard apart whole be to be damped with exception of only small quantity on windward side of heap be to be used for starting fire in two hour work be completed men be then ordered to return to camp have supper lie down at once then be to form up hour before daybreak in readiness to take place in boat be then to lie down in order until word be given to move forward be done just a daylight appeared heap of straw be lighted dense volume of smoke rolled across river entirely obscuring opposite shore from view saxon enveloped in smoke be unable to understand meaning on watch have seen sign of troop on bank before smoke began to roll across water general be uncertain whether great fire have broken out in forage store of swede whether fire have be purposely raised either to cover movement of army enable to march away cross at undefended point whether to cover passage swedish regiment be first to cross took place at once in boat king accompanying in quarter of hour opposite bank be gained marshal steinau able general have called saxon under arm be marching towards river when wind freshening lifted thick veil of smoke saw that swede have already gained bank of river at once hurled cavalry against swedish formation be not complete for moment be driven back in disorder forced into river water be willow king going about among quickly restored order discipline charging in solid formation drove cavalry back advanced across plain steinau recalled troop posted in strong position one flank being covered by marsh other by wood have time to effect arrangement a charles be compelled to wait until whole of troop be across a soon a be so led against enemy battle be severe one for swede be unprovided with artillery saxon with advantage of position powerful artillery fought steadily three time marshal steinau led cavalry in desperate charge time almost penetrated to point where charles be directing movement of troop at last be struck from horse by blow from butt end of musket cuirassier with difficulty carried from field a soon a fall became known disorder spread among rank of saxon regiment gave way swede rushing forward with loud shout whole army be speedily in full flight victory laid whole of courland at mercy of swede town opening gate at approach be now on confines of poland king brave to rashness a be hesitated to attack nation so powerful poland at time be country little larger than france though with somewhat smaller population in respect exceeding sweden with pole have quarrel for have taken part in struggle have be carried on solely by king with saxon troop authority of king of poland be much smaller than of other european monarch office be not hereditary one king being elected at diet composed of whole of noble of country nobility embracing practically free man a be necessary according to constitution of country that vote must be unanimous difficulty in way of election be very great civil war of constant occurrence charles be determined that must drive augustus who be author of league against from throne desired to do by mean of pole rather than to unite whole nation against by invading country poland be divided into two part larger of be poland proper must at once place thirty thousand men in field other be lithuania with army of twelve thousand force be entirely independent of other troop be for most part cavalry small force permanently kept up be composed almost entirely of horseman rarely drew pay subsisted entirely on plunder being a formidable to own people a to enemy lithuania on whose border king have taken post with army be a usual harassed by two faction that of prince sapieha prince of oginski between whom civil war be going on king of sweden took part of former furnishing with assistance speedily enabled to overcome oginski party who received slight aid from saxon oginski force be speedily dispersed roamed about country in scattered party subsisting on pillage thereby exciting among people lively feeling of hatred against king of poland who be regarded a author of misfortune have befallen country from day when charlie suggestion of burning damp straw to conceal passage of river have be attended with such success king have held in high favour there be few year difference between age suggestion so promptly made seemed to show king that young englishman be kindred spirit frequently requested to accompany in ride chatted familiarly with hate inactive life said one day must thousand time rather be fighting russian than setting pole by ear dare not move against for be augustus of saxony left alone must ere long set poland against at present pole refuse to allow to bring in reinforcement from own country if can not get men can get gold with gold can buy over chief opponent regain power if cost year delay must wait until be forced to fly kingdom can place on throne someone who will owe election entirely to in whose good faith can be secure that done can turn attention to russia by account daily becomes more formidable narva be besieged by will ere long fall can retake narva when once can depend upon neutrality of pole must be king of poland a well a of sweden with eighty thousand polish horse own swedish infantry must conquer europe if wished to do so know that be a fond of adventure a be be thinking of sending with envoy be despatching to warsaw know that pole be adverse to business of kind poorest noble who can scarcely pay for cloak wear who be ready enough to sell vote sword to highest bidder will turn up nose at honest trade consequence be a there be class between noble peasant trade of country be wholly in hand of jew foreigner among latter being hear many scotchman who while make excellent soldier be also keen trader class must have considerable power in fact although be exercised quietly jew be of course money lender a well a trader large number of petty noble must be in debt for money lent good supplied agent go specially charged to deal with archbishop who be quite open to sell service to although pose a one of strongest adherent of saxon with be not question so much of money a of power being wise man see that augustus can never retain position in face of enmity of great body of pole of hostility while agent deal with such noble a indicates a being likely to take part against augustus must ascertain feeling of trading class endeavour to induce not only to favour to exert influence posse on behalf a there be many scotch merchant in city must begin by making known to taking with letter of introduction from colonel other scotch gentleman whom may find to have acquaintanceship if not with men with family in scotland of course say that mission will be without danger will know be advantage in eye what do think of proposal know sire charlie said doubtfully have experience whatever in matter of kind will be good opportunity for to serve apprenticeship king said decidedly there be chance of anything being done here for month a will have opportunity of using sword can not be better employed than in polishing up wit will speak to colonel jamieson about evening count piper will give full instruction will obtain for from of friend list of name of men who must be likely to be most useful to will please to remember that brain doe great deal more than sword in enabling man to rise above fellow be brave young officer have many score of brave young officer be quick wit in suggesting strategy by crossed dwina without loss have marked out from among others made see that be fit for something better than getting throat cut king then changed subject with usual abruptness dismissed charlie at end of ride without further allusion to subject young fellow however knew enough of king headstrong disposition to be aware that matter be settled that must not without incurring king serious displeasure decline to accept commission walked back with serious face to hut that officer of company occupied asked harry jervoise to come out to what be charlie friend said have gracious majesty be blowing up have horse broken knee much worse thing than harry king appears to have taken into head that be cut out for diplomatist then repeated to friend conversation king have have with harry burst into shout of laughter be angry charlie can not help idea of going in disguise suppose trying to talk over jewish clothier cannie scotch trader be one of funniest thing ever heard do think king be really in king be always in earnest charlie said in vexed tone when once take thing into head there be gainsaying be true enough charlie harry said becoming serious well have doubt will do just a well a after there will be fun in will be in big city likely to have deal more excitement than will fall to lot here think will be at sort of excitement must care for harry however hope be that colonel will be able to dissuade from idea well know must wish that if be in place charlie undoubtedly be honour being chosen for such mission be possible may get great deal of credit for a king be always ready to push forward who do good service look how much think of because made that suggestion about getting up smoke to cover passage wish have never made charlie said heartily well in case charlie be likely enough must not be talking together here for loss in crossing river under fire must have be terrible well perhaps be a well a be charlie agreed did not want to attract attention be very happy a be with a for suggestion about straw anyone might have thought of must never have given matter moment consideration must be much better pleased if king have not done so either instead of telling colonel about colonel speaking to officer ridiculous fuss being made about nothing dear charlie harry said seriously seem to be forgetting that came out here together to make fortune at rate to do a well a must till stuart come to throne again father regain estate matter concerning let tell feel by mean so certain a did in old day then know friend be of way of thinking faith that stuart must return be like matter of religion be heresy to doubt for instant well see in year that have be out here one eye have got opened bit feel by mean sanguine that stuart will ever come to throne of england again that father will recover estate have seen here what good soldier can do how powerless men possessing little discipline though perhaps a brave a be against william of orange have got good soldier dutch troop be probably quite a good a best swedish regiment have have plenty of fighting in ireland elsewhere doubt whether jacobite gentleman however numerous without training discipline must more make head against than mass of muscovite must against swedish battalion at narva mean that be necessary that must if possible carve out fortune here so far certainly have reason to grumble on contrary have have great luck be lieutenant at seventeen if be not shot carried off by fever may suppose war go on army be not reduced be colonel at age of forty now on other hand have by happy suggestion of yours attracted notice of king be pleased to nominate to mission in there be chance of distinguishing in way of being employed in other more important business will place much farther on road towards making fortune than marching fighting with company must be likely to do in course of twenty year think must be foolish in extreme for to exhibit disinclination to undertake duty suppose be right harry be much obliged to for advice certainly put matter in light in have not before seen if thought must do well must not so much mind for a say there will be fun to be got out of excitement there seems little chance of doing anything here for long time what be to say to fellow how can argue with besides talk polish suppose there be ten men in army who do so probably not five a to what to say count piper will doubt give full instruction a to line be to take argument be to use inducement be to hold out be sure to be right well say anything about harry when get back still hope colonel will dissuade king then be singularly hopeful charlie be can say might persuade brick wall to move out of way a easily a induce king of sweden to give up plan have once formed however will say nothing about at nine o'clock orderly came to hut with message that colonel wished to speak to lieutenant carstairs gave friend comical look a latter rose buckled on sword what be joke harry father asked when charlie have left do know what colonel can want for at time of evening be not turn for duty know father must not say lad have not be getting into scrape hope nothing serious can assure really must not say anything until come back harry positive assurance a to impossibility of changing king decision have pretty well dispelled hope charlie might before have entertained entered colonel room with grave face know why have sent for carstairs yes sir be afraid that do afraid be to say like yes sir own that like do lad told majesty so said be too young for so risky business king scoffed at idea said 'he be not much more than two year younger than be if be old enough to command army be old enough to carry out mission know that be courageous be cool sharp intelligent why do choose have not saved from loss of about four five thousand men probably total defeat young fellow who can do ought to be able to cope with jewish trader to throw dust in eye of pole have chosen for service for two reason in first place because know will do well even who consider that be rash headstrong admit have knack of picking out good men in next place want to reward for service have done for can not at age make colonel of can give chance of distinguishing in service in age doe not count for so much count piper knowing wish in matter will push forward moreover in such mission a youth will be advantage for be very much le likely to excite suspicion than if be older man ' king manner did not admit of argument have only to wait ask what be command be simply that be to call upon minister tomorrow that must then receive full instruction king mean well by lad on turning over think better of plan than did before be convinced at rate that will do credit to king choice will do best sir charlie said at present seems so vague to that can form idea whatever a to what will be like be sure that king intention be at rate kind be glad to hear say that on consideration think better of plan then may mention matter to major jervoise certainly carstairs to son must go farther will put name in order a relieved from duty will mention that have be despatched on service might mean anything come see tomorrow lad after have received count piper instruction a king reminded there be many scotchman at warsaw be likely that of passed through sweden on way to establish there may very well have made acquaintance at gottenburg stockholm once established in house of one of countryman position must be fairly safe not altogether unpleasant must be certainly far better off than swede must be engaged on mission swede be of course regarded by pole a enemy a there be feeling against englishman scotchman might pas about unnoticed a one of family of scottish trader there a assistant fear being unpleasant in least colonel do think anything one way other about safety only fear that will not be able to carry out properly mission intrusted to will do best lad be can be expected have not solicited post a be none of choosing failure must be fault of who have sent not of in matter of kind there be such thing a complete failure when have to deal with one man may succeed may fail in endeavouring to induce to act in certain manner when have to deal with considerable number of men will be willing to accept proposal will not question of success will probably depend upon outside influence circumstance over have control have fear that will be failure if party in poland triumph if army here advance if augustus finding position hopeless leaf country good people of warsaw will join voice to of majority if matter go other way may be sure that will not risk imprisonment confiscation perhaps death by getting up revolt on own account king will be perfectly aware of will not expect impossibility there be really occasion whatever for to worry on ground upon calling upon count piper next morning charlie found that a colonel have told mission be general one will be duty minister said to have interview with a many of foreign trader jew in warsaw a can only going to to whom have sort of introduction from person may first meet who be a far a can learn from report of others ill disposed towards saxon party here be letter stating to whom may concern that be in confidence of king of sweden be authorized to represent in first place can point out to see must present situation continue will bring grievous evil upon poland proclamation have already be spread broadcast over country saying that king have quarrel with people of poland a sovereign have without slightest provocation embarked on war must fight against saxon troop until be driven from country will repeat will urge that will be infinitely better that poland must cast out man who have embroiled with sweden than that country must be scene of long sanguinary struggle in large district will necessarily be laid waste trade be arrested grievous suffering inflicted upon people at large can say that king charles have already received promise of support from large number of noble be most desirous that people of large town especially of capital must use influence in favour that have ambition end to serve save to obtain peace tranquillity for country that will be free for people of poland to elect own monarch when once augustus of saxony have disappeared from scene in sealed packet will find list of influential citizen have be furnished by one well acquainted with place jew be to be assured that in case of friendly monarch being placed on throne charles will make treaty with insuring freedom of commerce to two country will also use friendly endeavour to obtain from king diet enlargement of privilege that jew enjoy to foreign merchant will hold same language somewhat altered to suit condition want be not asking to organize public movement time have not yet come for simply to throw weight of example influence against party of saxon of course friend in warsaw have be doing best to bring round public opinion in capital to direction country be so torn by perpetual intrigue that trading class hold aloof altogether from quarrel in have personal interest be slow to believe that can be seriously affected by change will take place envoy will start tomorrow morning mission be open one go to lay certain complaint to propose exchange of prisoner to open negotiation for peace be pretence real object be to enter into personal communication with two three powerful personage well disposed towards come again to evening when have thought matter over will then be glad to hear suggestion may like to make there be one thing sir must like to ask will evidently be of great advantage to if can obtain private letter of introduction to scotch trader in city can not do unless by mentioning fact that be bound for warsaw have permission to do so be to be kept close secret see objection to naming to anyone can implicitly trust who may a think be able to give such introduction must impress upon that matter must be kept secret doubtless saxon have in pay people in camp just a have in theirs be word of going sent must find watched perhaps arrested must of course wish to be zealous in mission must say be over anxious be not trying to get up revolution in warsaw seeking to ensure that feeling in city must be in favour think may be brought about to extent by such assurance a can give of king friendship by such expression of belief in justice of cause in advantage there must be in getting rid of foreign prince a might be said openly by one trader to when men meet in exchange upon street so that ball be once set rolling may be trusted to keep in motion there can be little doubt that such expression of feeling among mercantile community of capital will have effect even upon noble who pretend to despise trade who be not unfrequently in debt to trader who hold view in certain respect thank sir at what time will come evening at eight o'clock by time may have thought out farther detail for guidance chapter in warsaw upon leaving quarter of count piper charlie returned to camp after discussing matter with major jervoise proceeded with to colonel

obtain sanction of diet afterwards there be urgency here king made agreement with czar king of denmark without anyone knowing of certainly obtained sort of sanction from diet afterwards everyone know how thing be worked have strong party of course because be interest of great many people to retain in power a one can say who must be chosen to succeed among people in general trader peasant be hated so be saxon soldier suppose have gained slice of swedish territory must not have benefited while a be sort of misfortune trouble have come upon country none can say how much greater may ensue poland be always split up into party used to unite against turk must unite again against swede if country be invaded a long a king charles keep army beyond frontier be too deeply engaged in own quarrel to

show scant mercy be known to be swedish officer in second place lower class be ever ready to make tumult if worked upon by archbishop noble of king party must readily enough tear stranger to piece going a do a scotchman there be hope little danger especially if be received into scottish household journey passed without incident until be within few mile of warsaw when charlie after formally

be true enough landlord admitted reluctantly still there be doubt country be kept poor while between men gather up harvest better that than let rot upon ground stanislas said unconcernedly then having obtained name of street where several of scottish trader have place of business charlie started on foot be not long in finding shop with sign of merchant swinging over door have better wait outside stanislas while go in see master if be not in shop men will not understand so come in with till see have met then go back to inn for night whether join there will depend upon warmth of welcome two

wish party to gain day for must maybe set up in fund might get money a be matter little there be not customer have be in debt money be always scarce with for be reckless extravagant keeping horde of idle loon about spending a much money on own attire that of wife a must keep whole scotch clan in victual if can not pay in money can pay in corn in cattle in wine in hide know be fondest of plotting fighting feasting yet reckless a be be people to like if do sell vote for money be not scotchman must throw in teeth for there be scotch noble since day of bruce who have not be ready to sell for english gold own highlander be a fond of fighting a pole chief be a profuse in hospitality a reckless spendthrift pole have virtue love country be ready to die for be courteous even chivalrous be hospitable to excess be good husband kindly master be recklessly brave if be unduly fond of finery who supply so many of must be last to find fault with on score be proud look down upon trader doe not hurt if be to take to trading there must be place for here have nothing to do with present purpose certainly if be question of polish affair foreign jewish merchant here must move finger one way other have everything to lose nothing to gain suppose took side with one of party other got upper hand why might make ordinance hampering in way laying heavy tax on forbidding export of cattle horse making life burdensome true if drove out must soon have to repeal law for trade must be at end must be too late for many of however say that at present time many must not be disposed to do what must against augustus of saxony be accustomed to civil war though may cause misery ruin in district where take place touch here in capital be different affair augustus have without reason provocation brought down fiery king of sweden upon if continues on throne may hear swedish cannon thundering outside wall may have city taken sacked therefore for once politics become natural business though may find many well wishers doubt if can obtain substantial aid with saxon troop in town noble divided there be hope of successful rising in warsaw king did not think of charlie said opinion be that be evident that citizen of warsaw be strongly opposed to augustus of saxony must have great moral effect that perhaps might influence of noble who a say be deeply in book upon whose estate may hold mortgage to join party against king might do something way allan ramsay agreed of course have money out on mortgage want badly enough money can lay hand on in own business giving credit a have to often very long credit requires large capital to carry on trade jew who doubt do hold large mortgage on land can not exert much power can not hold land be one of to venture to sell property of noble of influence must be ruined whole class must shrink from like enough there must be tumult got up house must be burned over head family murdered still a far a popular opinion go something might be done at rate will get of friend here tomorrow introduce to talk over must be careful for augustus have strong party here be suspected that be swedish officer must go very hard with tomorrow must fetch servant here have already sent round to inn will find valise in room said must rely thoroughly upon yes be handed over to by count piper moreover from what have seen of be confident that can be trusted be of swedish descent be think very honest fellow for fortnight charlie remained at allan ramsay then in spite of pressing entreaty of host hostess took lodging near have by time seen good many of leading trader of town scotch frenchman have heartily agreed with argument that be for benefit of poland especially for of warsaw that augustus of saxony must be replaced by king who must be acceptable to charles of sweden be of opinion that little must be done by towards bringing about result with jewish trader success be le decided admitted that must be great misfortune be warsaw taken by swede a pole retained confidence in national army be altogether sceptical that few thousand swede must withstand host must be put in field against several of pointedly asked what interest have in matter to of charlie be obliged to use power of promising sum of money in case of success there be one two however of whom felt doubtful chief among be ben soloman muller man of great influence in jewish community man have placed so large value upon service that charlie did not feel justified in promising such sum did not like man face did not rely upon promise of silence have given before mission be revealed to be for reason principally that determined to go into lodging must be denounced serious trouble might fall upon allan ramsay must at least minimize risk be not living at house when be arrested ramsay be disposed to make light of danger believe that ben soloman be old rogue be not fool can not help seeing that position of king be precarious be to cause arrest might get little thanks profit while must be incurring risk of vengeance of charles must ever become master of town did have arrested must be forced to appear a witness against must hardly do without matter becoming publicly known say however that if must curry favour with king party by doing harm without appearing in matter must hesitate for moment even if be arrested here doubt whether great harm must befall for scotch merchant must make common cause with although have political power have good deal of influence one way augustus at time must not care to make fresh enemy however lad will not further dispute decision be quite alone must not let leave so long a stop in city without taking great offence with wife two child man be more timid than if have to think of charlie therefore moved into lodging day went for three four hour to shop where kept up assumed character by aiding to keep ledger in learning from polish assistant value of various good in shop one evening be returning after supper to lodging when stanislas met observed three four evil looking rascal casting glance at house today there be several rough looking fellow hanging about house evening know if mean anything thought must let know think must be only fancy stanislas might be arrested by troop be denounced apprehend danger from men of class speak of however if must be interfered with fancy must deal with several rascal of sort at corner of street three four men be standing one of moved a passed pushed rudely against sending hat into gutter then a face be exposed fellow exclaimed be death to swedish spy be last word uttered charlie sword flew from scabbard with rapid pas ran man through body others drew instantly fell upon charlie with fury keeping up shout of death to swedish spy be evidently signal for men darted out of doorway came running down street repeating cry go stanislas charlie shouted a defended against dozen assailant tell ramsay have happened can do good here moment later received tremendous blow on back of head from iron bound cudgel fell senseless to ground chapter in evil plight when charlie recovered sens found lying bound in room lighted by dim lamp sufficed only to show that beam be blackened by smoke age wall constructed of rough stone work there be so far a must see furniture whatever in imagined that be underground cellar used perhaps at time other a storeroom be time before brain be clear enough to understand what have happened how have got into present position gradually fact came back to be able to think coherently in spite of splitting headache dull throbbing pain at back of head be knocked down stunned said to at last wonder what became of stanislas hope got away doe not look like prison must say that be cellar in house of one of gang set upon be evident that someone have betrayed probably that jew ben soloman what have brought here for wonder be going to do with head however hurt too much for to continue strain of thought after while dozed off to sleep when awoke faint light be streaming in through slit two three inch wide high up on wall still felt faint dizzy from effect of blow parched with thirst tried to call out for water scarce sound came from lip gradually room seemed to darken become indistinct again lapsed into insensibility when again became conscious someone be pouring water between lip heard voice speaking loudly angrily have picked up few word of polish from stanislas name of common thing word to use in case lost way how to ask for food for stabling for horse be unable to understand what be said judged however that someone be furiously upbraiding man who be giving water for latter now then muttered excuse be blowing fellow up for having so nearly let slip through finger said to probably want to question find out who have be in communication with will get nothing at present anyhow kept eye resolutely closed presently heard door open man come in few word be exchanged time wine instead of water be poured down throat then be partly lifted up felt cooling sensation at back of head bandage be passed round be laid down again there be more conversation then door opened two of men went out third walked back to muttering angrily to charlie felt sure that have be moved from place in have be evening before bond have be loosed be lying on straw not on bare ground opening eyelid slightest possible degree be confirmed in belief by seeing that there be much more light than must have entered cellar dared not look farther in short time fell into far more refreshing sleep than that before have next time woke brain be clearer though there be still dull sense of pain where have be struck without opening eye listened attentively there be sound of movement in room presently heard faint regular breathing continued for time then heard sort of grunt be asleep said to opening eye slightly looked round be in chamber be grimy with dirt almost a unfurnished a cellar there be window through sun be streaming brightly lay upon heap of straw at opposite side of room be similar heap upon man be sitting leaning against wall with chin dropped on chest thought of escape at once occurred to charlie must reach window be without glass mere opening in wall without awakening guard must drop out make for allan ramsay a soon a tried to move however found that idea be for present impracticable felt too weak to lift head at slight rustle of straw caused by attempt man opposite roused with start gave slight movement then again lay quiet with eye closed man came across spoke made sign more wine be poured between lip then man returned to former position be quiet a lay thinking position over charlie thought that who have set assailant to work must have have two object one to put stop to effort to organize agitation against king second to find out by questioning who be with whom have be in communication in order that might be arrested property confiscated must see other reason why life must be spared by assailant for must have be easier far le troublesome to run through a lay senseless on ground than to carry off keep prisoner idea confirmed suspicion have first entertained that assault have be organized by ben soloman must have real interest in king for be ready to join in organization against must have obtained own term might intend to gain credit with royal party by claiming to have stopped dangerous plot at same time to benefit by bringing about expulsion death of many of foreign trade rival for end jew must desire that must be taken alive in order to serve a witness against others will not get name from said besides none of have promised to take active measure against augustus did not ask to do so there be high treason in trying to influence public opinion still be likely enough that jew want to get to acknowledge that insurrection be intended will offer freedom if will give such testimony a be altogether in power only thing to do be to pretend to be great deal worse than be so to gain time till be strong enough to try to get away from place be not arrived at at once be result of half dreamy cogitation extending over hour interrupted by short snatch of sleep be conscious that from time to time someone came into room spoke to guard three four time wine be poured between lip once be raised up fresh cloth dipped in water bandage applied to head in evening two three men came in believed that recognized voice of one of a of ben soloman one of men addressed suddenly sharply in swedish how be feeling be in pain have come here to give freedom charlie be on guard remained silent with eye closed be of use ben soloman said in own language fellow be still insensible clumsy fool who hit must fare badly if knew who be said that be to be knocked down silenced brought here here be of more use than if be dead will doubtless come round in time said in apologetic tone will bring round if will have patience ben soloman well well other replied few day will make difference mind that be well guarded directly begin to gain strength will get out of town a soon a can allan ramsay have laid complaint before mayor that countryman have be attacked by band of ruffian have be either killed carried off by be pity servant of be not killed thought be dead two three of looked at must have sworn that life be out of well then must have sworn what be not true for managed to crawl to ramsay where lie be told dangerously ill official have be to to obtain account of fray be bungled business from beginning to end must not have calculated on fellow making such resistance other grumbled one seemed lad yet killed three of party other killed one nice business will have to pay friend well ben soloman for can tell there be grumbling at price say be not enough for work told must be easy ought to have be jew said sullenly fifteen twenty men to overpower lad what must have be more easy however will do something for friend of men who be fool enough to get killed if hear grumbling from others will be worse for there be not one must not lay by heel in jail well a to young fellow will not come again want to be noticed coming here keep shrewd lookout after there be fear about that man said will be long ere be strong enough to walk when get better will have taken away to safe place outside town once there can make say what like if doe not get well in case will take away body bury outside will see to understand other sneered want anyone to know where be buried so a to be able to bring up against attend to own business jew said angrily why must care about what say at rate there be matter between there be fear of speaking not until time come when may think worth while to throw away life in order to secure death ben soloman be of use talking like that jew said quietly be useful to other have saved life from gibbet have done work required between be worse than childish to threaten in present matter doubt that will do business well know that will be well paid for can of require more charlie must have given good deal to understand conversation must have be specially glad to learn that stanislas have escaped with life for have taken great fancy to young lithuanian be grieved by thought that have probably lost life in defence three day passed head be now clear appetite returning found by quietly moving at night when guard be asleep that be gaining strength third day there be talking among several men who entered room then be lifted wrapt up in cloth put into large box felt being hoisted up be carried downstairs then placed on something minute afterwards felt vibration followed by swaying bumping guessed at once that be on cart be being removed to prison to other place of confinement latter considered more probable journey be long one have mean of judging time thought that must have lasted two three hour then rumbling ceased box be lifted down carried short distance then lid be opened be again laid down on straw heard sound of cart wheel knew that vehicle on have be brought be being driven away be now so hungry that felt must no longer maintain appearance of insensibility two men be talking in room when for moment conversation ceased gave low groan then opened eye came at once to bedside with exclamation of satisfaction how do feel one asked in swedish know said in low tone where be how did get here be with friend never mind how got here have be ill will soon get well again someone hit on head picked up brought here be weak faint charlie murmured have food will have food directly be prepared take drink of wine see if can eat bit of bread while broth be preparing charlie drank little of wine be put to lip then broke up bread ate crumb by crumb a if be great effort to do so although have difficulty in restraining from eating voraciously when have finished closed eye again a if sleep have overpowered hour later there be touch on shoulder here be broth young fellow wake up drink that will do good charlie a before slowly sipped down broth then really fell asleep for jolting have fatigued terribly be evening when awoke two men be sitting at blazing fire when moved one of brought basin of broth fed with spoon charlie have be long enough in country to know by appearance of room that be in peasant hut wondered why have be brought there concluded that must be because allan ramsay have set so stringent search on foot in city that considered necessary to take away will not keep here long said to be sure must walk now in two three day will be strong enough to go distance soup have done deal of good believe half weakness be from hunger no longer kept up appearance of unconsciousness in morning put various question to man who spoke swedish a to what have happened how came to be there man be evidently from dress appearance jew while other be a unmistakably peasant rough powerfully built man with evil face jew gave little information told that in day two when be strong enough to listen friend must come who must tell about on third day heard sound of approaching horse be not surprised when after conversation in low tone outside ben soloman entered charlie be now much stronger have carefully abstained from showing marked improvement speaking always in voice little above whisper allowing men to feed after making one two pretended attempt to convey spoon to mouth well master englishman ben soloman said a came up to bedside what do think of thing know what to think charlie said feebly know where be why be here remember that there be fray in street suppose be hurt why be brought here instead of being taken to lodging because must be no use to in lodging may be great deal of use to here ben soloman said know endeavoured to entrap into plot against king life charlie shook head looked wonderingly at speaker said there be plot against king life only asked if must use influence among friend to turn popular feeling against augustus nothing of kind jew said harshly wanted removed by poison knife there be mistake about be what be going to swear what if want to save life will have to swear too will have to give name of concerned in plot to swear that be agreed to bring about death of king now understand why be brought here be mile away from house may shout scream a loud a like be in power must die rather than make false accusation listen to jew said sternly be weak now too weak to suffer much day week will return then have best change mind sign document will bring with with full particular of plot to murder king name of concerned in will sign will take to proper authority obtain promise that life will be spared on condition of giving evidence against person must never sign such villainous document charlie said will sign ben soloman said calmly when find roasting over slow charcoal fire will be ready to sign anything wish to so saying turned left room talked for time to men outside then charlie heard ride off villain said to when come at end of week will not find here if get chance of having reckoning with will be bad for charlie progress be apparently slow next day be able to sit up feed two day later must totter across room lie down before fire men be completely deceived by acting considering attempt to escape in present weak state altogether impossible paid little heed to peasant frequently absenting for hour together looking from window charlie saw that hut be situated in thick wood from blackened appearance of peasant face garment guessed to be charcoal burner therefore judged that tree saw must form part of forest of considerable extent weather be warm other guard often sat for while outside door during absence charlie lifted log of wood piled beside hearth be able to test returning strength assuring that although not yet fully recovered be gaining ground daily resolved not to wait until seventh day for ben soloman might change mind return before day have named determined therefore that on sixth day must make attempt have fear of being unable to overcome jewish guard a must have advantage of surprise only delayed a long a possible because doubted power of walking great distance of evading charcoal burner who must on return certainly set out in pursuit of moreover wished to remain in hut nearly up to time of jew return a be determined to wait in forest revenge for suffering have caused for torture to intended to put evening before day on decided to make attempt charcoal burner jew be in earnest conversation word signifying brigand be frequently repeated although must not understand much more than concluded from peasant talk gesture that have come across of men in forest have gathered from sign have observed perhaps from fire that be there jew shrugged shoulder when narration be finished presence of brigand be matter of indifference to next day charcoal burner went off at noon where doe go to charlie asked guard have got charcoal fire alight be obliged to go see to have to be kept

skin of wine seized meat cut up roasted over fire after meal be eaten captain called upon charlie to tell story more fully did with aid of man who spoke swedish starting however only at point when be attacked in street a felt better to remain silent a to connection with swedish army be cause of ben soloman hostility to there be in warsaw who be of opinion that augustus of saxony have done much harm to poland in engaging without cause in war against charles of sweden who think that must be well that must be dethroned other prince made king in place to party many of trader belong jew have reason to think be acquainted with design must give name of concerned in there be really plot against augustus be only intended that popular demonstration against rule must be made soloman wanted to give evidence that there be conspiracy against king life so that might gain great credit by exposing might at same time rid of many of rival in trade be artful fox leader of brigand said when have be translated to where be jew put over three four of men sprang to foot ran out jew be nowhere to be seen captain be furious abused men right left while anger be in way mitigated when one of told that if have wanted jew kept must have given one of order to look after be so evident that chief be silenced for moment how long be since of saw last went round with wineskin filled cup just a sat down to breakfast one of men said have not noticed since have of others then will be no use to pursue have have more than hour start long before will have mounted ben soloman horse have ridden off well comrade said turning to charlie settle movement be half in earnest before a to joining be clear now that there be nothing else for to do for present fellow will directly get to warsaw denounce a murderer of master that be sure to do to avert suspicion from if be to return there must go hard with so for time must throw in lot with when be translated to charlie saw at once force of argument must not have denied that jew have fallen in hand to hand struggle with be to appear in warsaw might be killed by co religionist of ben soloman if escaped might lie in dungeon for month awaiting trial perhaps be finally executed there be nothing for now to rejoin swede must be time yet before must be sufficiently recovered to undertake such journey must not mind if must send letter to allan ramsay to tell have befallen will be thinking be dead will at rate be in great anxiety about have taken liking to young fellow leader said will send in one of men to warsaw with letter be if can write one

jew who be here unfortunately heard that be in struggle with ben soloman be killed will of course denounce a murderer though deed be done in fair fight must have tribe against might be imprisoned for month awaiting trial be still very weak must not attempt journey to frontier be however gaining strength a soon a be quite recovered will take first opportunity of leaving men be with making for swedish camp please forward news by sure hand to count piper express sorrow that mission have not be completed although indeed think that further stay at warsaw must have be great service for be clear that great majority of trader will not move in matter until swede advance from point of view be not to interest to do so know little of men be with at present beyond fact that be bandit can say whether be disbanded soldier criminal who have escaped from justice at rate show ill will have doubt will be able to get on fairly with until be able to make escape wish have poor stanislas with only one of men here speaks swedish doe not know very much of language can not say at present whether twenty men here be whole of band whether be only portion of do know whether men subsist by plundering peasant venture on more serious crime thanking for great kindness during stay at warsaw remain yours gratefully charlie carstairs while be occupied in writing letter animated conversation be going on between bandit charlie gathered that related to future operation more than must not learn in postscript to letter requested allan ramsay to hand over to bearer of clothes left in lodging to pay for trouble a to money left in hand think worth while for to send however much men may consider comrade have not sufficient faith in honesty to believe that money must reach safely if send suit of clothes two three gold piece might be wrapped up in piece of cloth shoved into toe of shoe parcel must be small one there must be little chance of man carrying far will ask however to bring sword if will buy one for pistol folded up letter gave to captain there be mean of fastening mattered little because being written in english there be chance of being read captain handed to one of men with instruction for delivery messenger started at once others after remaining short time in hut set out through forest after hour walking charlie be unable to go further captain seeing ordered four of men to stop with to follow next morning a soon a have gone on with rest of band men set about collecting stick making fire charlie who be utterly exhausted threw on ground be not long before fell sound asleep when awoke shade of evening be already falling men be sitting over fire roasting portion of goat one of flock have fallen in with in wood where large number roamed about in semi wild state man who must speak swedish be one of who have remained with from learnt that present headquarters of band be six mile farther away distance be performed next morning frequent halt being made to enable to sit down rest be not till five hour after start that arrived overgrown a now be with tree undergrowth must see that village once stood there must however have be abandoned very long time a tree of considerable size grew among low wall pile of stone marked where cottage have stood place occupied by brigand have in former time be castellated building of strength standing on knoll in middle of village have probably be inhabited by retainer of owner part of wall have fallen large arched room have doubtless be banqueting hall of castle remained almost intact here brigand have established several fire burned on flagged floor smoke finding way out through hole crevice in roof fifty men be gathered round be occupied in cooking midday meal be glad to see that have arrived captain said coming across to charlie expected two hour ago intended a soon a have finished meal to send out four men to meet help to carry in thank charlie said be not men fault be late last part of way came on very slowly be getting so exhausted that have to stop few hundred yard well have better eat something then lie down for sleep meat be plentiful with for there be thousand of goat in forest occasionally get deer wild boar if have bread wine must live like noble supply however be low at present will have to make expedition tomorrow next day to replenish charlie ate few mouthful of meat then lay down slept for hour on bed of leaf be awoke by loud excited talking among men learnt from honred that one of men who have be left on watch at mouth of path by have entered forest have just brought in news that party of hundred infantry led by jew have arrived with cart in body of ben soloman have be sent off while troop have established in little clearing round hut come of letting that jew escape captain said doubt told story own way jewish trader went to governor asked that troop must be sent to root out well be far enough away at present have sent off to have movement watched be good nine mile from here to hut may look for week before find place unless rascally jew have heard of from woodman get hold of fellow though must think will hardly do fancy have cause of quarrel with authority will not put in way of being questioned closely if can help next morning when charlie awoke two men be standing beside eye first fell on one who have be to town who held large bundle in hand then turned eye to other gave exclamation of pleasure a saw that be stanislas looked pale weak be evidently just recovering from severe illness why stanislas exclaimed be pleasure indeed never for moment dreamt of seeing heard from jew who guarded that got away be afraid that have be badly wounded why brave fellow what brings here have come to be with honour man said be of course duty to be by side be very ill for week for have dozen wound managed after assailant left to crawl back to mr ramsay to tell have happened remember much about next few day since then have be mending rapidly none of wound be very serious be more loss of blood than anything else ailed mr ramsay searched high low for have given up for dead till few hour before man arrived with letter heard have killed ben soloman have long talk with messenger who received handsome present from mr ramsay agreed to conduct here upon solemn promise if captain must not receive must not give information on return a to whereabouts of band mr ramsay hired light cart brought yesterday far into forest camped there have not more than couple of mile to walk to get here morning have seen captain charlie asked eagerly yes be stopped by sentry quarter of mile away be kept there while guide came on got permission of captain for to be brought in when met have great difficulty in persuading to let stop for mr ramsay have given fifty rix dollar to give so honour here be here be letter from mr ramsay can not tell how glad be to have stanislas be getting better be so weak that took five hour yesterday to get six mile now have got to talk to will pick up strength faster than have be doing for have be very dull work having one who must understand there be only one man here who understands word of swedish will soon get round sir never fear have brought with four cask of wine be left at place where cart stopped last night captain have sent off men already to bring in will be better for suit of clean clothes that will be month now since have change jerkin be stained with blood want wash more than anything for there be water near hut charcoal burner used to bring in small keg from spring passed on way to work be enough for drinking not enough for washing matter never seemed to have entered into head that of jew a being in slightest degree necessary there be well just outside stanislas said saw drawing water in bucket a came in suppose be well of castle in old time will go have wash change clothes first thing charlie said mr ramsay letter will keep till after went out to well together so heard story have killed ben soloman before left before letter arrived mr ramsay sent for told jewish trader have just informed that news have come that ben soloman have be murdered deed have be done by young scotchman who have be with mr ramsay did not believe story in slightest admitted that ben soloman might have be murdered even said frankly that hated a be be most natural end for to come to that must have done so be said absurd in first place did not think that be alive in second be far more probable that have be murdered by ben soloman than that must have be murdered by however even before letter came three four hour later there seemed longer doubt that have killed jew by time there be quite uproar among people be leader of community have dealing with so many noble that influence be great although be little liked be regarded a important person loss be very heavy one to jewish community deputation went to governor heard that troop must be at once sent out to capture band of brigand have joined mr ramsay told that be fortunate indeed that have not returned to city doubt have told that in letter feel quite man stanislas charlie said when have changed garment now can read letter brought after expressing great satisfaction felt at news that charlie be alive mr ramsay went on to say that even be well must not return to warsaw in present state of public feeling story that be attacked grievously wounded after being confined here for day carried away confined in wood by order of ben soloman that visited there must be treated with derision version given by man who brought in story of jew death be that be staying in cottage of charcoal burner acquaintance of that party of brigand of whom be one arrived there that be boasting of having caused death of ben soloman who have fallen by hand managed to escape from brigand on road found dead body of employer who be knew that morning coming out to give instruction opinion that of friend who knew be that fellow have killed robbed master letter of course showed that account be true to extent that ben soloman have fallen in struggle with that be prisoner in hand of bandit still a must be next to impossible for to prove truth of story a jew of place who be numerous influential be dead against life must certainly be forfeited be to be captured know story to be true must appear wildly improbable to others that wealthy jew must have conspired in first place to cause attack to be made upon unknown young stranger still le that must have have carried off to forest must have gone to visit there explanation that be swedish officer in disguise must not benefit in way while must involve who knew in danger must cause jew to be regarded a man who have lost life in endeavouring to unmask plot against poland therefore think be extremely fortunate that be for present safe in hand of brigand must certainly advise to make attempt to leave until be perfectly well strong have a directed hidden few piece of gold in shoe have handed rest of money to man who be starting to join will conceal about have just heard that body of troop be starting at once for forest that order have be sent to other town to send detachment into at different point so be evident authority be determined to catch if possible if have killed dozen trader in smaller way must have cared little about just at present pressed a king be by want of money be bound to do everything can to please jewish trader a be upon that must rely for loan for payment of troop in matter then will leave stone unturned to gratify must strongly advise band to move away from neighbourhood at rate for time may plunder whole village with impunity what be regarded a murder of richest citizen of warsaw man mixed up in business politics with principal noble of land be different matter altogether think of trying to traverse country until be perfectly strong will be dangerous business at best with man with to bear brunt of replying to question have confidence that will succeed in making way through a to can give advice a there be saying a to point from may start direction in may travel must at time find in town in there be of countryman established in trade will find nearly everywhere use name think be pretty generally known to scotchman in poland will see have inclosed note will be useful to inclosure contained only few word allan ramsay merchant of warsaw do declare bearer of note to be friend beg countryman of mine to whom may present to assist in way must require money to furnish with undertaking to make responsible for same to pay monies other charge that may incur first thing to do charlie said a placed letter in doublet be to let leader of band know that other body of troop besides at hut be about to enter forest may decide that be necessary to march away at once a soon indeed a outlaw received tidings issued order for band to prepare for instant departure party of five six men together said to charlie might hide in forest for year band of fifty be too large to be long concealed to begin with must get food must either buy hunt for in second there be considerable number of men living in forest charcoal burner herder of goat swine of if questioned by troop might mention that have seen considerable number of men passing a be will break up into party of seven eight appoint rendezvous where may meet again band be speedily mustered for with exception of who be watching forest through troop at hut must march to reach whole be close at hand messenger be sent off to call in scout then booty have be taken during late excursion be brought out emptied on ground consisted of money jewellery be divided into equal portion of member took one lieutenant of band two captain three share time latter said to charlie next time of course comrade will have portion when be done men be told off in party of six seven instruction given a to point of rendezvous band chose own leader in hour from reception of news place be deserted party be making way in different direction through forest charlie stanislas formed part of captain own force numbered ten in do think will turn up at meeting place charlie asked leader whose name now ascertained be ladislas koffski may said be seldom that band when once disperse like ever come together again be impossible to content everyone man who be chosen leader of party may if be dissatisfied persuade with to join other band even if go in body many be sure to break off make for home to enjoy booty have gathered upon other hand a go will gather up fresh recruit with so many disbanded soldier discontented men roaming country there be difficulty in getting a many men a one care to keep together fifty be outside be advisable for with more even if one make good haul come to so little head that men be dissatisfied of course work in small party doe not succeed so well a when small band be under single leader how long have be at work since last autumn find pay get much in money a saw there be four rix dollar head be result of month work still be not bad for men who might otherwise starve sometimes do worse sometimes better be about average still life be pleasant one unless disbanded soldier took to what must there be for to do if government must keep on regular pay there must soon be brigand left except men who have escaped from justice treasury be empty even at best of time troop be badly irregularly paid be forced to plunder to keep life together be almost in rag though pole mind fighting there be generally difficulty in getting sufficient infantry a for cavalry be noble draw pay how do feel today better night rest wash change of clothes morning have made feel man how far do intend to march will go slowly for day two other party have pushed on ahead fast by taking matter quietly by keeping sharp lookout need have great fear of being surprised know forest well thickest hiding place so can afford to travel slowly a become accustomed to will be able to make longer journey for ten day travelled through forest increasing distance daily a charlie regained strength last day two did not make le than twenty mile day face be turned steadily east occasionally passed large tract of cleared land village cultivated field at of stopped replenished stock of flour took without paying for did farther damage of meat have abundance two three men started day a soon a halted in short time returned with goat young pig be now close to bug river ladislas said at last halting place tomorrow will meet at least of comrade expect great many for be pretty equally divided a to direction must travel in practically be safe from pursuit when have gone fifteen mile for forest there spread out greatly in search of must know that further pursuit must be useless many of men did not care about going farther part of country have be so harried for last two three year that thought best to try altogether new ground when have crossed bug will be beyond forest there be great swamp morass hill with patch of wood many stream take rise there meeting farther on forming dnieper must keep north of river for to south country be thinly populated must have difficulty in maintaining charlie made comment be glad to hear that band intended to keep to north of dnieper for river must have formed serious obstacle to making way to rejoin swede next day reached bank of bug following river down came after hour walking upon great fire round fifteen men be stretched a captain party approached rose to foot with shout of welcome be better than expected ladislas said a came up to five twenty be quite enough for work here in forest one can do with more moving steadily on a mean to do till get pretty near eastern frontier five twenty be ample be enough when together to surprise village be not too many travelling in two three to attract attention thing always go on better too after dispersal many who be discontented who want to command band of own break off one start fresh with just men one like best to keep have begun to give up captain one of men said a joined other party have be here six day travelled slowly at first be only last two day have really made fair journey there be reason for great haste world be own at rate a long a be in forest there be fear of wanting food so see of comrade have left can do very well without captain there be thirty of here two day ago essos polinski quarrelled essos be killed then polinski wanted to elect captain to move away at once four five who have always be grumbler joined at once persuaded of others till be about equally divided came pretty nearly to fight liked to begin moved away there be quite enough of left ladislas said a to essos polinski be heartily glad that have gone know have be scheming for leadership for time most of others can be very well spared too there be plenty of here for travel there be doubt a agreed before starting that there be not much more to be done in part of country what with civil war band of soldier without leader others like ourselves who mean to starve peasant have be wrought up into state of desperation have little left to lose what have got be ready to fight to death for lately at first alarm have sounded bell assembled for mile round equipped with scythe flail routed who meddled with have more than one hot fight lost many good men besides many of noble who have suffered have turned out with follower struck heavy blow at of band so that sooner get out of country be becoming nest of hornet better for there be little booty plenty of hard blow to be got will go on a agreed till near eastern frontier country be well covered with forest there can sally out on side like for if there be not much gold to be have in russian village there be plenty of vodka sometimes thing worth taking in church priest headman too have generally got little store can be got at with aid of few hot coal string twisted tight enough round thumb at rate sha' starve must move on pretty fast for will have to get up warm hut in forest to lay in stock of provision before winter set in so must only stop to gather little plunder when good opportunity offer chapter treed by wolf charlie stanislas be that evening sitting apart from rest at short distance from fire talking over future agreed that must be comparatively easy to withdraw from band a journeyed forward if a seemed likely travelled in very small party if indeed found with two others must leave openly for must scarcely care to enter upon desperate struggle merely for sake of retaining two unwilling companion in band difficulty must only begin when started alone a be talking captain came across to can guess said that be talking together a to future like young englishman like companion who seems honest fellow must not keep with by force understand that be not placed a be have to live most of must live honestly if must at present be choice of doing a do starving occasionally take few crown if come across fat trader may ease rich farmer of hoard be seldom such chance come in way a rule simply plunder because must live be different with friend may be far away if can get to must have that need therefore life be hard rough to say nothing of danger doe not suit for that must stay with for must be madness for to attempt to escape a told peasant be maddened must kill passing stranger a must wild beast must regard a spy of band like ours of company of disbanded soldier sent forward to discover house village be best worth plundering in case have other danger to fear may be sure that news have be sent from warsaw to different governor with order for arrest for killing ben soloman order will be transmitted to town village hair eye must at once betray a stranger ignorance of language must be fatal to if therefore escaped being killed a robber by peasant must run risk of arrest at first town village entered translate to stanislas be learning language fast can not understand that be just what be talking about charlie said when stanislas have repeated captain speech danger seems too great to be risked think that when get farther to east will be able to make way more easily up into livonia much more easily because forest be more extensive there not until winter be over cold will be terrible must be death to sleep without shelter besides forest be infested with wolf who roam about in pack must scent follow devour when spring come can turn face to north leave if think fit promise that hindrance will be thrown in way only ask not to risk life by trying now to pas through poland alone think be right ladislas promise that will not attempt to leave during journey east a say must be impossible for to travel after winter have once set in be now end of september will be november before reach destination will not travel fast have motive for doing so have to live by way to gather little money to help through winter may shoot bear elk sometimes few deer hare will want two three sack of flour spirit for must either get money take good first be best for have mean of dragging heavy weight with must not do to infuriate peasant by plundering of within twenty mile of place where mean to winter must set against tell frankly ladislas that will not be willing to aid in act of robbery of course when one be with army one have to plunder on large scale have often gone terribly against grain when have have to join party sent out to forage have to be done must rather not join men in taking food yet understand that may be necessary a to taking money will have nothing to do with at same time understand that can not share food be with without doing something stanislas have brought little money from warsaw will be ready to pay into common treasury sum sufficient to pay for share of food a to money taken will not expect share of if be attacked will of course fight will be ready to do full share in work so at rate will not be loser by taking with be fair enough captain said when stanislas have translated what charlie said suppressing however remark about foraging with army a brigand be ignorant that charlie have connection with swede that be not a have given out young englishman come out to set up a trader band now journeyed slowly on keeping near north bank of dnieper went by two three uniting sometimes entering village surrounding farmhouse at night taking what wanted people be however terribly poor be able to obtain little beyond scanty supply of flour occasionally few gold silver trinket many other band of plunderer have passed along in course of summer robber be often moved to pity by misery that everywhere met with when in small party be obliged to avoid entering village for once twice furious attack be made upon who did so woman joining men in arming with weapon came to hand in falling upon stranger only once did succeed in obtaining plunder of value have visited village found contained nothing worth taking one of woman said why do trouble poor people like there be count chateau three mile away have luxury there while be starving after leaving village man to whom have spoken repeated what have said be agreed to make attempt at first cottage came to made further inquiry found that lord of soil be very unpopular for in spite of badness of time insisted on receiving rent without abatement where money be not forthcoming have seized cattle horse assessing at price far below what must have fetched at nearest market therefore marched to house be very large one captain thoughtfully placed

very cold snow have fallen occasionally for last four five day in open country be lying inch deep next day journeyed few mile farther then chose spot for erection of hut be close to stream men at once set to work with ax to fell tree clear space be agreed that captain two of men of most pacific demeanour must go to nearest town forty mile away to lay in store be away five day then returned with welcome news that cart laden with flour couple of barrel of spirit be on country track through forest mile half away how did manage captain charlie asked went to house of well to do peasant about mile

peasant be hung up outside hut to freeze hard meat be eaten only once day a must be impossible to obtain fresh supply until weather became settled enough to admit of hunting preparation be just finished when snow began to fall heavily for week came down without intermission wind howled among tree even charlie half stifled a be by smoke felt inclination to stir out except for hour work to clear away snow from entrance to carry in wood from pile time passed more cheerfully than might have be expected have by time begun to talk polish with facility be able to understand story that men told a sat round fire sometimes tale of adventure have gone through sometimes story of history of poland frequent internal war struggle with turk making bread cooking occupied portion of time much be spent in sleep at end of week snow ceased falling sun came out be glad to leave hut enjoy clear sky keen air while have be confined to hut two of men have made large number of snare for hare at once started into forest to set in spot where saw trace of animal passage over snow rest went off in party of two three in search of other game with exception of charlie be accustomed to wood a stanislas have much le experience than others captain decided to go with be easy for anyone to lose way here said in fact except to one accustomed to wood must be dangerous to go far away from hut a long a be fine will find way back by following own track if weather changed suddenly came on to snow case must be hopeless one of advantage of placing hut on stream be that form great aid to finding one way back if strike above follow down if below upwards until reach hut of course might wander for day never hit still be much more easy to find than small object like hut though even when found must be difficult to decide whether have be struck above below hut now there be one rule if at time get lost begin to wander wildly about for if did must certainly walk in circle might never be found again sit down quietly think matter over eat if have got food with then examine sky try to find out from position of sun direction in cloud be going way hut ought to lie always take with one of pistol if fire three time at regular interval will be signal that want help of who be within hearing will come to aid with exception of hare of good many be snared hunting be not productive track of deer be seen not unfrequently be extremely difficult even when animal be sighted to get across surface of snow to within range of clumsy arquebus that two three of men carried did however manage to shoot few by erecting shelter just high enough for one man to lie down under leaving until next snowstorm so covered that seemed knoll in ground low shrub bent down buried under weight of snow shelter be erected close to path taken by deer by lying patiently day in men occasionally managed to get close shot several bear be killed two elk afforded food for long time a frozen flesh must keep until return of spring hole be made in ice on stream baited hook being set night be seldom that two three fish be not found fast on in morning altogether therefore there be lack of food a under teaching of captain charlie in time learnt to be able to keep direction through wood be often able to go out either with stanislas alone thus keeping clear of close smoky hut during hour of daylight upon whole found life by mean unpleasant one among article purchased by captain be high boot lined with sheepskin coming up to thigh with coat have hood to pull over head charlie felt cold little during day while at night found hut often uncomfortably warm sleeping a did in same attire in went out in february weather became excessively severe more so peasant charcoal burner occasionally met with declared than ever remembered wild animal became tamer in morning when went out frequently found track of bear have be prowling round hut in search of offal bone thrown out be now obliged to hang supply of meat by rope from bough at distance from ground by mean be enabled to prevent bear getting at no longer dared to venture far from hut for large pack of wolf ranged through forest driven by hunger even entered village where attacked killed many woman child made entrance into shed tore dog horse cattle to piece became at last so dangerous that villager be obliged to keep great fire burning in street at night to frighten away several time occupant of hut be awakened by whining snarling of wolf outside wall roof be alike built of solid timber roughly made door of thick wood be now fastened night against opening so stoutly supported by beam behind a to defy assault beyond therefore passing grumble at being awakened by noise men gave trouble a to savage animal outside if brute grow much bolder captain said one day will be prisoner here altogether must have come down from great forest extends over large part of russia village be scarce there peasant take good care to keep beast in shelter so no doubt be able to pick up more at edge of forest here how far be from russian frontier think anyone must tell for aught know may be in russia now forest be sort of man land suppose line of frontier have ever be marked be russia to east of forest thirty mile away be poland to west of forest be good to anyone except charcoal burner have met russian pole in wood a there be plenty of room for ay must be be there thousand to one now working in be on friendly term with other especially a two nation be at present allied against sweden in spite of wolf charlie continued walk in forest accompanied always by stanislas carried ax pistol although charlie have heard many tale of solitary men even of vehicle being attacked by wolf in broad daylight believed that most of story be exaggeration that chance of two men being attacked in daylight be small indeed have found that track by cart have brought store be good deal used snow being swept away levelled by runner of sledge of peasant who came into forest for wood charcoal of traveller journeying between russia poland generally selected road for walk because be le laborious than wading through untrodden snow because there be here fear of losing way be spared incessant watchfulness for sign be necessary among tree at first have frequently met peasant cart on road since cold became more severe wolf more numerous daring no longer encountered have indeed heard from of last saw that must come more for that charcoal burner be abandoning hut going into village one afternoon when have on return nearly reached spot where left road to strike across forest to hut heard noise behind be pack of wolf in full cry stanislas exclaimed have better get up into tree be after something hastily clambered into tree whose lower branch be six seven foot from ground moment later two horse wild with fright dashed past while twenty yard behind came pack of fifty sixty wolf be almost silent now with red tongue hanging out brute have be attacking sledge stanislas said in low tone saw horse be harnessed broken trace be hanging by side be easy to read story sledge be attacked horse mad with fear broke trace rushed off perhaps driver seeing at last moment that escape be impossible slashed rope with knife so a to give horse chance expect got start for wolf must be detained little at sledge do think poor beast will get safe out of forest stanislas think so may chase have evidently be long one wolf have tired with first effort to come up to did not seem to that be gaining when passed be simply question of endurance fancy wolf will last longest see here be party of straggler suppose stopped longer at sledge seems to be on scent stanislas do see be coming along at side of road where walked with head down be afraid be well will soon see yes be leaving road where did moment later dozen wolf ran up to trunk of tree there gathered snuffing whining presently one caught sight of two figure above with angry yelp sprang up in air immediately be growling snarling leaping charlie laughed out loud at impotent effort be laughing matter sir stanislas said gravely can not climb up here stanislas can keep here will be dark in hour likely enough will watch night then have better shoot two of jump down with hatchet keeping back to back ought to be able to face ten wolf yes if be see here come three four more dozen will soon swell to score will have to wait here night probably for time tomorrow for men be not likely to find very early will hardly hear pistol unless of happen to come in direction do think if shoot two three of rest will go certainly not will be worse comrade must at once tear to piece devour scent of blood must very soon bring others to spot well if have got to wait here night stanislas have better choose most comfortable place can at once before get dark must mind go to sleep tumble off there will be fear of sleeping stanislas said cold will be too great for will have to keep on swinging hand foot rubbing nose to prevent from getting frostbitten well have never felt cold in clothes charlie said sir have never be out at night sitting cramped on tree hour after hour passed even in darkness must see wolf lying in snow below occasionally changing position keeping close together for warmth often snarling growling angrily a one two shifted position tried to squeeze in so a to get into warm spot cold be intense in spite of swinging leg arm charlie felt that vital heat be decreasing be awful stanislas think can last on till morning begin to have doubt sir perhaps must be better to leap down make fight of might shoot of first charlie said how many charge have have only two besides one in barrel have only three charlie said powder have run very short captain be saying yesterday that must send to village try to get more still six shot will help not much sir there must be thirty forty of now have seen come from other way suppose be part of pack followed horse charlie sat for time thinking then exclaimed think be dead tree be sir noticed when climbed up head have gone think must have be struck with lightning last summer then think can manage manage what sir man asked in surprise manage to make fire stanislas first of will crawl out towards end of branch a far a can get break off twig small bough if ca get enough can cut chip off will pile where three big bough branch off from trunk have tinderbox with see reason why must not be able to light fire up here so might stanislas said eagerly if did might set whole tree on fire bad thing charlie rejoined may be sure fire will keep wolf at respectful distance must get down enjoy heat without fear believe idea will save life sir ten minute ago must not have given crown for chance at once crawled out upon two of great branch renewed chorus of snarl from below showed that foe be watchful snapping of small branch excited certain amount of uneasiness among drew off short distance in ten minute charlie companion worked back to main trunk carrying armful of twig first cut off number of small dry chip made pile of at junction of one of branch with trunk then got out tinderbox bunch of rag shook few grain of powder from one of horn among chip then got tinder alight shred of rag have be rubbed with damp powder be applied to spark then placed among shaving flash of light sprang up followed by steady blaze a dried chip caught one by one at first then a fire gained strength several stick at time be laid over burning splinter in five minute large fire be blazing charlie companion took seat where other two big branch shot out from trunk be two three foot higher than on fire have be lighted ere long sensation of genial warmth began to steal over fresh stick be lighted a first be consumed before long trunk where flame played on began to glow light tongue of flame rose higher higher until trunk be alight ten twelve foot up wolf be gone charlie said looking down suppose have gone very far sir when tree once get fairly alight may be sure wo venture anywhere near have already be forced to move little distance away from trunk by heat a flame rose higher higher embracing in course of hour whole of trunk upper branch felt that be perfectly safe to drop off into snow beneath blazing brand soon began to fall stood short distance away so a to be beyond risk of accident at charlie suggestion ran in from time to time gathered up brand laid at foot of trunk in short time second fire be kindled here tree be now pyramid of fire lighting up snow for long distance round outside circle wolf must be heard whining whimpering occasionally uttering long drawn howl know that be baulked of prey stanislas said will have of big branch falling soon will be able to keep up roaring fire will last until daylight must think by time wolf will be tired of will make off if not captain will be sure to send men out to search for will guess have be treed by wolf have only to get into tree fire pistol to bring in direction may be attacked too charlie remarked there be ten of be sure to come armed with ax sword ought to be able to fight way through good sized pack besides wolf will be so cowed by great fire think will have courage to meddle with so strong party one by one arm of tree fell burnt through at point where touched trunk must have be far too heavy to be dragged three four of fell across lower fire there lay blazing not knowing way tree must fall charlie companion be obliged to remain at distance off heat there be amply sufficient for at last trunk fell with crash at once established a near fire a must sit without being scorched there chatted until morning began to break felt sure that at least of wolf be around a occasionally caught sight of what looked like two spark among undergrowth being a knew reflection of fire in eye of wolf there be tree hard by in must if necessary take refuge therefore resolved to stay near fire fortunately night have be perfectly still a tree have fired be detached one flame have not spread a charlie have at one time be afraid must do hour after daylight have fairly broken discharged three shot at regular interval with pistol then waited hour will fire again not until hear shot from charlie replied have four charge left if wolf made sudden rush might want to use after time thought heard distant report of musket stanislas looked at charlie inquiringly latter shook head stanislas that gun must be heard twice a far a one of pistol let wait until be pretty sure that be near like leaving without other protection than ax chapter rescued party after considerable pause gun be again fired time much nearer to charlie drew out pistol be about to reply when companion touched arm look said charlie turned in time to see several gray form flit rapidly between bush stepped to edge of road saw wolf spring out through bush go straight along road what can have scared asked in surprise gun be not near enough for besides must have fled deeper into forest instead of taking to road perhaps hear something coming almost at same moment two shot be heard in direction towards wolf be making be charlie excitedly exclaimed body of wolf have attacked passing traveller heap wood on stanislas if make great fire get a far a possibly must spring off take refuge here at rate brand will be better weapon even than ax end of such branch a be able to move be brought together few blow with ax speedily broke off several of outer end of charred wood be thrown on fire soon blazed up high again two more shot be heard time close at hand ran into road sledge with several figure in be coming along at full speed be almost surrounded by wolf a looked two of sprang at horse head two shot again rung out dropped backwards among companion many of whom threw at once upon body while sledge continued on headlong course here here charlie shouted at top of voice waving hand to show direction be to take moment later sledge dashed past swept up to fire seize blazing brand charlie shouted a in sledge threw out stanislas rolled two first wolf over with pistol then joined others driver have run at once to horse have muffled by throwing coat over head of one rug over head of other though snorting trembling in limb stood quiet until have thrown head rope round of neck fastened to heaviest of branch then seized handful of fallen leaf be exposed by melting of snow above threw into fire whence dense smoke poured out wolf have again stopped to devour two animal have be shot gave time to men by united effort to move heavy branch place across two others whose end lay in fire so a to form with sort of triangular breastwork face of next to be manned by two traveller servant charlie stanislas with blazing brand charlie companion hastily loaded pistol again two gentleman have rifle brace of pistol a have servant lady child have be lifted from sledge crouched down at angle by fire sledge two horse protected one of face of position driver at master order took position on front seat again so a to shoot down wolf might try to attack flank of outside horse wolf looked doubtful at appearance of dense smoke rising up after little hesitation rushed to attack four be rolled over by bullet from rifle a came within few yard pistol cracked out in rapid succession a soon a be emptied six men caught up blazing brand struck full in face of wolf shouting loudly a did so seized with momentary panic animal turned fled then fierce fight took place between injured wolf companion there be just time to recharge rifle pistol when came on again although fire of defender be a deadly a before wolf seemed time determined to get at victim in vain be blow showered on head while who first sprang on tree be stabbed with knife defender held in left hand contest must have have one termination when suddenly two shot be heard then with loud shout party of men through forest with pistol axe fell on wolf unexpected onslaught have decisive effect with loud howl yelp wolf turned fled up to time not word have be exchanged by defender beyond charlie first shout of lay branch across two order of one of gentleman to coachman to take place in sledge where have done work well for four wolf lay dead by flank of outside horse several of have sprung at head of horse have be shot cut down by master who have placed close to horse thick mufflings have

of number fierceness of wolf hoped that by travelling only by day with excellent horse there be not much to fear especially a be five armed men fell in with few wolf yesterday beat off easily enough last night stopped at little village in forest certainly made feel uneasy there with tale about wolf there be help for started a soon a day broke have driven fifteen mile before came up to have not gone five when wolf began to show at first kept well behind presently came upon large number who joined in near where saw overturned sledge with snow stained with blood round from there kept up running fight must have killed score number increased rather than diminished when fresh pack came up from ahead quarter of mile before saw looked a if case be hopeless for horse have be going at top of speed from time started be beginning to flag while wolf be fast closing in upon be just beginning to attack horse when saw in road now pray tell how came to be there so opportunely how be that have that great fire blazing charlie gave full history of previous night adventure wonderful count brother exclaimed former went on have heard many story of escape from wolf never one like yours be admirable thought indeed that of at once obtaining heat frightening wolf away by setting tree on fire thought saved life a well a own for fate must have be same a unfortunate traveller whose horse saw who brought wolf upon now sir must be impertinent to ask for what purpose have come to poland believe only put question in order to see if can in way be of assistance to know count whether avowal will affect unfavourably know that will make difference in conduct towards be a servant told englishman by birth father be obliged in consequence of political opinion to leave country be now captain in service of charles of sweden exclamation of surprise broke from hearer well sir count said smiling a majesty king charles although not yet one twenty be one of greatest general in europe can not consider strange that who appear to to be older must be captain in service own pictured to myself that officer of wonderful soldier be fierce looking men regular iron veteran be eighteen charlie said feel absurd must be captain be two year since be appointed ensign king happening to be with company when have sharp fight with russian rewarded by having made into regiment so of got promotion be appointed captain last may a reward for suggestion turned out useful may ask what be captain carstairs for seems to that be full of happy idea king charles a may have heard speaks freely to officer soldier a move about camp be standing on edge of river looking across at saxon on day before made passage when king came up spoke to said there be hope of passage being covered a advance against russian at narva have be by snowstorm said that a wind be at back if be to set fire to great straw stack smoke must hide movement from saxon idea be very simple one must no doubt have occurred to king however put into execution with success be good enough afterwards to promote to rank of captain so be owing to that army rather saxon army for few pole be engaged in battle be defeated count said smiling well sir will do harm with for personally be entirely opposed to augustus of saxony have not yet explained how officer in swedish service came to be here be sent by king charles to warsaw to ascertain feeling of trading class there have introduction to scottish merchant passed a countryman of who have come out to enter business one of object of mission be to endeavour to induce foreign merchant in warsaw to do what must to promote feeling in favour of peace with swede substitution of king in place of augustus be not very clear captain carstairs how can be fulfilling that object by passing winter with party of robber for suppose disbanded soldier be little better in forest on confines of russia charlie laughed be rather long story count perhaps will kindly tell news about public affair first by mean count said be long story too wife must much rather hear yours than listen to have not yet recovered from event of morning will wait until be at village have left forest behind half hour will take to stromoff where can get pretty good accommodation horse splendid pair of animal have during passage through forest shown sign of fear starting nervously swerving going in sharp sudden rush always needing constant strain on rein to keep from bolting once away from tree however settled down into fast trot seven mile to stromoff be done in le than hour sooner did landlord of inn learn name of guest than wife son bustled about in greatest haste to make thing comfortable for huge fire be lighted in guest room common room be cleared of other customer until chamber must be sufficiently warmed for occupation while in kitchen preparation be made for meal to in hour from arrival party in sledge sat down when be over settle be placed round fire charlie then gave full account of adventure from time be attacked in street of warsaw so be captain carstairs after whom there be so keen search in death of ben soloman made great stir can assure that there be great many people who owe debt of gratitude man have son property passed to widow whom have seems treated harshly during lifetime be from holland wished to return to people so a mean be very large made easiest term with on whose estate husband have held mortgage in order to wind up affair a soon a possible thus death be subject of wide rejoicing however if have be caught at time fear must have gone hard with for jew be very keen about a man rascal though be be one of chief head of religion be to fall into hand in of town must either kill send to warsaw now sir will tell have taken place since september thing have moved slowly augustus endeavoured after defeat on dwina to make peace with charles on own account without knowledge of diet charles refused to give audience to of agent must not even see beautiful countess of konigsmark who be know swede whom augustus sent thinking that blandishment might win over young king be useless charles maintained ground that took up from first namely that must treat with diet must have nothing to say to augustus so diet sent embassy of four senator instead of receiving with pomp ceremony a expected king met on horseback demanded that a first condition must dethrone augustus party in diet be pretty equally divided proposal be rejected for even most hostile to augustus resented proposal that free unconquered people must be ordered by foreign prince to change king so nothing came of swedish army advanced certain distance into poland there be great number of skirmish there have be serious fighting be there much chance of until snow have gone country dried up in spring at present augustus be quarrelling with diet who still set against importation of more saxon troop doubtless before campaign begin in earnest will have settled matter with senator will have own way in respect there be however little chance of diet agreeing to call out whole force of country next battle will like last be between swede saxon who may have with perhaps few thousand pole belonging to king party belong to king party count like majority of noble have interest whatever in war for be never consulted before began be affair between saxony swede let fight out must be bad day for poland if augustus russian be to overcome despoil sweden want addition of territory for must be to strengthen king against see trouble caused by augustus having saxony at command if have other territory country must be divided into two part one of must have nothing in common with other still le do wish to see russia gain territory to north of hitherto have thought little of muscovite war have shown that can put great army into field czar be making into nation may day be formidable to charles have sent assurance that have ill will towards poland be enemy not of country of king who have formed coalition against in time of profound peace that hostility will altogether cease with overthrow expulsion of augustus so see who live at distance from capital hold altogether aloof from intrigue of court look on at fray a if be one in have part lot if augustus drive out swede will probably have trouble with afterwards if charles drive out augustus will have fresh king will doubt choose one upon recommendation of charles who will then march away again leaving to manage own affair therefore have animosity against a swedish officer for comfort sake be better that nothing must be said of must introduce to friend simply a english gentleman who have rendered greatest possible service countess retired to bed short time after have finished meal others sat up talking until late in evening charlie learnt that country be still in greatly disturbed state party of disbanded soldier others rendered desperate by cold hardship be everywhere plundering peasantry many encounter have taken place between noble who with retainer have marched against travel must be dangerous for long time to come therefore until spring must not think of moving count said indeed think that best plan when start will be to work due north join swedish force near narva will be shorter a well a le dangerous still can talk of later on next morning started early arrived in afternoon at chateau of count be not fortified building for pole differed from western nation abstaining from fortifying town residence upon ground that be free people capable of defending country from foreign invasion therefore requiring fortified town such place added to risk of civil war enabled faction to set will of nation at defiance building be large one struck charlie a being singularly plain barn like in comparison with residence of country gentleman in england number of retainer ran out a drove up into courtyard exclamation of surprise dismay rose a wound on horse flank leg be visible when in few word count told that have be attacked by wolf have be saved principally by english gentleman follower men crowded round charlie kissed hand in other way tried to show gratitude for

augustus have gathered on th of july swede arrived within few mile of clissow next day reinforcement arrived king decided to give battle on following day be anniversary of victory on dwina previous year army be twelve thousand strong while of augustus be nearly double that strength be very strongly posted camp being surrounded by morass although situated on rising ground commanded whole of country round bog in front be found to be so impassable that swede be forced to make circuit to left where ground be firmer movement obliged enemy also to change front movement caused considerable confusion a be forced to traverse boggy ground to take up new position facing that by swede must now advance attack be commenced by division commanded by duke of holstein scarcely have set troop in motion than be mortally wounded by ball from falconet troop however pushed forward vigorously polish division opposed to resisted two first assault bravely gave way at third attack be driven from ground in such confusion that took further part in engagement while be going on saxon cavalry have be repulsed by of charles passing in retreat under fire of three infantry regiment suffered so heavily that left field swedish foot now advanced along line in centre destroyed several battalion of saxon swedish right be attacked so vigorously by saxon left under field marshal steinau for time conflict be doubtful swedish horse guard other cavalry however charged with such determination that saxon horse on flank be also defeated driven off field while swedish infantry advancing without firing drove several battalion of saxon foot into village where being surrounded almost be killed taken prisoner saxon horse gathering once more attempted bravely to retrieve fate of day engaged

severely contested saxon lost four thousand killed wounded three thousand taken prisoner while swede have eleven hundred killed wounded forty eight cannon be captured by victor together with baggage waggon death of duke of holstein gallant prince who be exceedingly popular with army beloved by king cast gloom over great victory virtually laid poland at foot of victor insured fulfilment of object for charles have persisted in war jamieson regiment have be on left wing a have be held in reserve to strengthen line at point at might give way scotch have taken small share in fighting have thirty men killed wounded by shot bullet passed over head of fighting line captain of one of company be among killed charlie who have since rejoined regiment be doing duty a lieutenant now took vacant place army still advanced augustus sent in several proposal for peace be rejected saxon have speedily rallied after battle be not in position to oppose advance of victorious swede who occupied cracow without meeting with resistance seeing that augustus must not be strong enough to hazard pitched battle charles have on morning after victory ordered three of regiment of jamieson be one to march with speed to reinforce major general schlippenbach who have sent urgent request for aid a heard that russian army fifty thousand strong be preparing to cross frontier a have six thousand must not hope to oppose advance successfully a king order enjoined troop to march with greatest possible speed performed journey back to warsaw in four day although distance exceeded hundred mile mounted messenger have be sent on before on reaching town found boat already prepared to take down river to danzic where order have already be sent for ship to be in readiness to convey to revel fatigue since campaign opened have be severe troop enjoyed long day of rest while craft conveyed dropped quietly down vistula then came short sea passage on arrival at revel bad news met have come too late on th of july russian army have passed frontier swede have tried to oppose at passage of river embach water be low from effect of long drought russian be enabled to ford at several point swede fell upon who first crossed for two hour repulsed attack obtaining at point considerable advantage capturing gun a fresh reinforcement poured across river tide of battle turned russian cavalry drove back swedish horse who a retreated rode through infantry threw into disorder be attacked by russian before must recover from confusion be almost entirely destroyed taken prisoner general many of mounted officer effected escape rallied broken cavalry fell back towards revel russian spread over country plundered burning little town of valk murdering inhabitant carrying off into slavery whole of population who fell into hand arrival of three regiment be hailed with much satisfaction by people of revel who feared that russian might besiege town did not however approach within many mile after completely wasting country retired across frontier victory have be gained over swede at embach destruction of greater part of general schlippenbach force enabled czar to turn arm against ingria extreme eastern province of sweden included shore of lake ladoga whole of coast of baltic between narva finland urgent message be sent by governor of province to general schlippenbach requesting to send aid a have not even sufficient men to garrison walled town general be however afraid that narva must be again besieged therefore dared not reduce small force to considerable degree drew one company from of three regiment embarked on board ship for mouth of neva a there seemed little prospect of service for time near revel officer be eager that company must be chosen for service in ingria colonel jamieson therefore said wish to choose one company more than can equally be depended upon therefore think fairest way will be to draw lot a to will go lot fell upon charlie company therefore formed part of expedition on reaching mouth of neva heard that town of notteburg situated at point where neva issue from lake be already besieged by russian that swedish vessel on lake have be obliged to come down river fort have be raised by russian on bank to prevent succour being conveyed into town two thousand men have crossed river occupied small redoubt on northern side so that town be completely invested newly arrived force be ordered to march at once with hundred horse four field piece whole under command of major sion who be well acquainted with country what do think of expedition captain carstairs lieutenant john bowyer asked must rather be back with king charles charlie replied of course know geography of place if russian keep eye at open see how force like ours with cavalry gun can hope to enter town unnoticed addition of horseman seems to altogether ridiculous a must be no good whatever if did enter town a for four field piece will hamper march a say russian have already forty cannon in position about town little piece must be useless four hundred infantry making attempt at night under good guidance might manage to slip into place procession of ours be to mind tempting destruction for certainly can not hope to cut way by force through whole russian army even if do get inside town plight can be better russian cannon be bombarding night day more battery be in course of erection schlippenbach governor who be believe brother of general have few piece to reply to be there army advancing to relief of place must be different altogether for reinforcement might be of vital importance in repelling assault until aid arrived there be hope of aid king army be nine hundred mile away hand be full general schlippenbach have sent a many men a must spare say there be at least twenty thousand russian round town where be army to come from can compel to raise siege to mind will either be destroyed making way into town if do get in will be made prisoner of war if not massacred for russian have vague idea a to giving quarter when town fall may be fortnight hence seems bad lookout altogether lieutenant remarked very much so best possible thing must befall must be for russian to make out before get too far into line in case may be able to fall back before can gather in overwhelming strength may thus draw off without very great loss major sion called captain of infantry company troop of horse to sort of council of war when little force halted for hour at three o'clock in afternoon have ten mile to march gentleman must like to ask opinion a to whether must be best to try to force way in a soon a get there to halt at distance of three four mile from russian make effort at daybreak before be fairly afoot other three officer gave opinion in order of seniority advocated plan of falling upon muscovite at daybreak what do think captain carstairs major sion asked charlie regret to say major that opinion differs from of other gentleman for several reason in first place if halt so near russian presence in neighbourhood may be betrayed by peasant may be surprised in night if such mishap must take place must have to be on foot two hour before sunrise in way doubt knowledge of road be at time difficult to make out mere track like be following at night in morning might well find involved in russian intrenchment from must not extricate ourselves before large force have gathered round in case must be killed taken prisoner own suggestion must be that must remain here two hour then continue march so a to reach spot where be to endeavour to break through line about sunset must be observed a most likely must be might at hour be taken for freshly arrived body of russian troop there must be risk of losing way might hope to be close upon before be discovered to be enemy if succeed a trust will in breaking way through reaching town well good if on other hand find greater obstacle than expect be forced to fall back fighting will have advantage darkness will be setting in russian greater part of whom will be ignorant of strength will lose time before move fearing may be assaulted in other quarter in darkness might be able to make good escape be certain none of must do must meet with repulse at daybreak reason be very just captain carstairs though certainly opinion be in accordance with given by fellow officer be bound to say that argument seems unanswerable what say gentleman have two object in view first to reinforce garrison of second to save troop under command if must fail in doing so know country well feature will be considerably altered tree will have be cut down house levelled intrenchment thrown up camp scattered here there own in dark might a captain carstairs say very easily miss way think proposal therefore unites greatest chance of getting through line entering town with possibility of drawing off troop without great loss in case of failure other three officer at once agreed order be issued for men to lie down until five o'clock rest before pursuing march be past that hour before be in motion again major sion with peasant from neighbourhood of notteburg rode ahead then came troop of cavalry with gun close behind followed by infantry a approached russian line peasant several time went on in advance presently trooper rode down line with order that troop with firearm be to light match spearmen to keep in compact body be now not far from russian line destruction have be wrought during last ten day be visible to tree bush have be felled for use in intrenchment for erection of shelter few blackened wall alone showed where house have stood garden have be destroyed orchard levelled light smoke must be seen rising at many point from russian fire when troop be halted be mile from intrenchment word be passed down that rapid swedish march be to be moderated that be to move carelessly at slow rate a if fatigued by long march that spear be to be carried at trail a be so much longer than used by russian length must if carried erect at once betray nationality of troop there be attempt at concealment for cavalry must be visible for considerable distance across flat country considerable body of men must be seen gathered round fire at distance of not more than quarter of mile on hand a column passed between there be sign of stir in short time order be passed for troop to form from column into line cavalry officer who brought said that there be russian battery erected right across road little more than quarter of mile ahead thing look better captain carstairs lieutenant said a company happened to be leading fell into line yes have doubt will take battery coming down a do upon rear question be be there intrenchment ahead major sion told when halted that peasant assured that there be work beyond that be weakest point of line be three day since came out from notteburg working hard a russian evidently do may have pushed on intrenchment far in advance of battery by time force halted for moment gun be unlimbered turned round loaded then line of cavalry opened right left four piece poured discharge of grape into russian clustered thickly in battery four hundred yard away then with shout swedish cavalry charged infantry coming on at run behind surprise be complete with cry of terror russian for most part leapt from battery fled few who attempted to defend gun be sabred by cavalry there be other work ahead major sion exclaimed a sitting on horse looked over parapet body of troop scattered about push forward men at double do captain sherlbach cut way for with cavalry sun have set few minute before gun be fired charlie a led men over earthwork saw russian line in front congratulated upon fact that in half hour must be quite dark a approached next line of work scattering fire of musketry opened upon aim be wide without loss reached work russian though inferior in number defended obstinately continually received reinforcement of body of men running up from side in five minute swede cleared work of a prepared to advance again saw large body of horse riding down to bar advance while number of footman be running to occupy intrenchment ahead of trumpet be sounding to right left rear can not force way farther major said to charlie knew nothing of work be fatal to enterprise must retreat while can do not think so yes sir think enterprise be quite hopeless order be given troop faced about formed into closer order at double retraced step spearmen of company forming front line musketeer second already be growing dusk cavalry riding ahead scattered small body of men who threw in way battery have first taken be entered without loss there be momentary halt here for men to recover wind then musketeer poured volley into dark line advancing upon horseman charged in among long pike of front line cleared way with shout swede passed through foe pressed forward more troop be gathering to bar way major changed line of march sharply to right sweeping along by side of force through have just cut way musketeer on flank firing into a passed movement be adroit one for in gathering darkness enemy in front must not be able to distinguish friend from foe to perceive nature of movement for few minute be unmolested then course be again changed charlie be beginning to think that in darkness must yet make escape when dull heavy sound be heard in rear be russian cavalry bowyer take musketeer on with keep close to company ahead will break up with pikemen if do come up to give volley then continue retreat with rest while captain of other two company have placed pikemen in front line charlie have placed in rear in order to repel attack of cavalry from direction now formed in close clump taking place among russian squadron came along with deep roll like of thunder be thirty yard away when perceived little cluster of men with levelled lance few unable to check horse rushed upon point most of reined in little steed in time in moment swede be surrounded by wall of yelling horseman of whom tried to break through hedge of spear while others discharged pistol charlie listened anxiously for roll of volley of musketry sound came felt sure that whole body of cavalry have halted round that movement have saved rest who must now if fortunate be able to make way off in darkness men be falling now from pistol fire of cossack feeling that work have be done determined to make one effort to save men with level spear charge through shoulder to shoulder said be only chance once through throw away spear break up in darkness most of may escape now with shout swede rushed forward in body horse rider went down before there be rush from behind charlie shouted to rear rank to face about in confusion din word be unheard there be brief struggle in darkness charlie emptied pistol cut down more than one of opponent then sword fell on shoulder while at same moment be ridden over by cossack be stunned by force of fall when recovered consciousness several men with torch be moving about at order of officer be examining body of fallen saw pas sword through body of three of own men who be lying near a came up to closed eye expecting similar fate be officer captain one of torch bearer said in russian very well carry to camp then if be alive general may want to question seeing that breathed four of russian soldier took upon shoulder carried away pain of wound caused by movement be acute retained consciousness until after what seemed to journey of immense length be again laid down on ground close to large fire several officer stood round asked first in polish then in swedish for water at order of one who seemed of superior rank to others be at once brought to king treat prisoner well officer said will do everything can for hour later doctor came to side cutting open coat applied bandage to shoulder be serious wound charlie asked in swedish might be worse will be troublesome one be sabre cut have cleft right through shoulder bone be hurt anywhere else think so be knocked down in dark believe stunned though have sort of recollection of being trampled on feel sore over surgeon felt rib limb repeatedly asking if hurt when finished examination said be doubtless badly bruised think anything be broken cossack horse be little more than pony have be heavy horse must have trod life out few moment later there be sound of trampling horse halted close by officer drew back moment later marshal scheremetof commander of russian army came up to charlie side of speaks swedish asked officer one of stepped forward ask what force be attacked with what object a charlie saw reason for concealment replied that be body of four hundred swedish infantry troop of horse with four gun object be to enter town must have be mad to attempt to cut way through whole army general said when answer be translated to by saint paul nearly succeeded swede be mad be too much even for madman ask whence force came may be that large reinforcement have reached vyburg without knowing arrived two day since charlie replied when question be put to came in ship together from revel did others come with be next asked at general dictation no other ship have arrived others be coming a charlie have doubt that great effort must be made to send further reinforcement replied many more troop be coming can not say when will arrive will be soon can not say think will come from revel there be talk of large reinforcement whether from sweden from king army can not say be swede general asked be englishman in swedish service general have many of countryman with general said must have be better for have come to czar see that be well treated said to officer then mounted rode away chapter old acquaintance next morning charlie be placed in tent in lay several officer who have be wounded night before by shot from town learned with great pleasure upon questioning doctor that swede have got off safely in darkness eight ten men only have straggled be made prisoner not more than twenty have be left dead on field have satisfaction therefore of knowing that defence made by own pikemen have be mean of saving whole force in other respect have nothing to complain of for be well attended to received same treatment a russian for ten day roar of cannon continued seventy gun keeping up incessant fire on town at end of time governor capitulated be allowed to march out with honour of war only forty out of brave garrison remained unwounded at end of siege a well a such of comrade a be strong enough to travel passed through line of russian marched to vyburg three week after being made prisoner charlie wound be so far healed that surgeon pronounced able to sit horse under escort of officer four cossack be taken by easy stage to bercov prison fortress short distance from moscow have inquired from surgeon who attended for doctor kelly doctor knew said that be not with army be believed away visiting town on volga where serious pestilence be raging charlie remained short time at wound be healing rapidly surgeon who attended assured that there be prospect of making complete cure if must keep arm for week in sling have nothing to complain of a to comfort food governor who spoke little polish visited day asked many question a to native country on one of visit said to asked yesterday if knew doctor kelly one of chief surgeon of army who a have heard be at present on volga mentioned that be friend of yours that have made acquaintance when be unlucky enough before to be prisoner in hand be sorry to say have today seen official report in name appears among list of who have fallen victim to pestilence be sorry to hear that charlie exclaimed because be very kind to liked much because in second place be sure that must have used influence with czar to obtain exchange a soon a possible be very unfortunate governor said especially a exchange be of rare occurrence few officer may be taken prisoner on side in skirmish number be too small to make loss of importance to russia sweden be month since have taken step to bring about exchange have influence appointment here be sort of punishment for having offended czar by not having brought up regiment in time to take part in fight when attacked at narva saved regiment be not regarded a excuse for having be three day longer on march than czar expected so be sent here a sort of dismissal from active service know one else who must move in matter one governor of castle at plescow be surly fellow be reprimanded by czar at least so heard for not having treated sufficiently well be only three four day there only officer saw besides doctor kelly be friend of doctor be at table when dined with kelly seemed to to be fine fellow by by did say jokingly that if be ever made prisoner again be to ask for that must do anything must for what be name governor asked peter michaeloff do know added a saw look of surprise in governor face know one of name governor said doubtfully know that be doctor though may be for know something of many thing oh be doctor charlie said confidently know kelly said must take off limb a well a must do what sort of man be be tall strong man with black hair gray eye have rather positive way of talking seemed to have very strong opinion about thing looked good tempered must say that must be passionate enough if be put out that might be peter michaeloff know governor said be sure said that be to ask for if be second time taken prisoner be quite certain said so though know whether promise meant much certainly spoke a if thought might be able to help though did not seem likely must have such bad luck twice think meant at time what said must think be sort of man who must keep word will make inquiry governor said find out if can where be at present yes must think that must be able to assist if chose to interest in matter ten day later governor came into charlie room officer have arrived with order for removal said be to be taken up again to notteburg be very sorry charlie said have be very comfortable here have be very kind to feel sure change will not be for better besides be nearly into september now in marshy country round lake river winter will be even more severe than be here only thing can think of be that swede at vyburg may have taken russian captain prisoner that be going to exchange governor shook head there be no longer swede at vyburg ingria be in hand swede have retired into finland may be that be work of friend sent message to peter michaeloff must be found in neighbourhood by officer who be going there telling that be here that having met when prisoner at plescow relied on good office must officer have found there have given message may probably have begged field marshal to order to be taken to prison there where must be near visit sometimes doctor must have good deal more influence in army than have among swede charlie remarked if be how have come about must be matter of favour governor said if michaeloff be acquainted with field marshal have attended when unwell must ask little favour of sort if field marshal sent here must send for again without more trouble than signing name to order well if be michaeloff who have done charlie grumbled doubt meant kindly must much rather that left here ride of two hundred fifty mile in august be not pleasant to begin with thought of winter in swamp be enough to make one shiver with comfortable room warm stove will not find much to complain of captain carstairs governor said with smile doubt michaeloff may be enabled to obtain leave for to go out with on parole be about to ask now that be strong well again whether must like to give parole offer use of horse for ride when inclined for thank governor if michaeloff can do that will certainly be boon be not disposed to agree that change can be work in first place know that be there in second can hardly think that must have managed most of see must possibly have have hand in matter for even supposing officer have found directly arrived then given message have acted upon at once there must have be time for order to get here must have needed messenger riding night day with frequent relay of horse to have got to notteburg back since day spoke to about matter when be to start a soon a have eaten breakfast order say beend at once field marshal expect order to be

be there to see off well sir charlie said if be way in convey prisoner from one place to in russia will certainly be able when meet king charles to report to most favourably a to treatment of officer who have fallen into czar hand will make journey very much more pleasant one than have expected be glad be pleased governor said that have unpleasant recollection of stay here minute later carriage dashed out through gate of prison officer be seated by charlie side two cossack galloping in front while two others rode behind be worth making change if only for drive charlie thought cheerfully a dust flew up in cloud before horse hoof felt sense of exhilaration from keen air blew in face journey be performed with great rapidity one of cossack galloped ahead a soon a arrived at station where changed horse have fresh one in readiness at next post house cossack be changed at other station fresh relay from men stationed there taking place excellent meal be served three time day night

have have must not have travelled more comfortably if have be russian grandee well be glad to meet again doctor said heartily let see be twenty month since supped together last at kelly quarter poor fellow will miss greatly have heard of death governor of bercov told of fortnight ago be indeed sorry to hear will never forget kindness to yes be good man skilful in profession full of zeal energy

be immaterial to story doctor broke in need not tell what be be of course something to do with augustus way charles be hunting down unfortunate king be shocking be downright malignity why have wasted fifteen month over already have cost ingria must have made term with poland liked after victory on dwina must then have be free to use force against a be have wasted two summer be likely to waste that not for material advantage simply to gratify hatred against augustus have left to take ingria almost without blow to gain what russia have wanted for last hundred year foothold on baltic may be great general be politician real statesman must throw away solid advantage in order to gratify personal pique considers augustus author of league against charlie said czar have ground at of quarrel against talked over that last time met doctor said with laugh told then that foothold on baltic be so necessary to russia that must have accepted alliance of prince of darkness to get a to augustus defend be ambitious a suppose most of be thought saw opportunity of gaining territory have found that have made mistake will of course lose province charles persecution of go beyond bound never before did sovereign insist upon nation consenting to dethrone king at dictation go on with story listened without remark until charlie concluded wish have be in service said instead of of sweden must have mounted fast have requisite for success above promptitude of decision quickness of invention did well in getting away from jewish scoundrel in hut in killing master be adventure with wolf showed quality that idea of setting fire to tree in be sitting in order at once to warm to frighten away wolf must never have occurred to russian quickness with formed with three log redoubt against wolf showed quick military eye ability to think act in moment of danger now tell how be that be only officer captured other day charlie briefly related how with pikemen of company have stayed behind to check pursuit of russian horse to gain time for main body to lose in darkness russian struck fist on arm of chair be well done said there be difference russian captain must have done if have be

riding about hundred yard behind charlie have difficulty in keeping up with nicholson traced to house in quiet street lying behind abbey boy came out held horse while rider dismounted then led away to stable of inn short distance away charlie turned at once joined harry need not have taken trouble have harry still there be knowing evidently fellow have fear of being detected be going to pas for week a gentleman from country suppose be in habit of stopping at house whenever come up with pocket lined be regarded there a respectable gentleman by landlord now have better take horse to stable where agreed to hand over will meet at lodging plan what to do next discussion did not lead to much there did not seem to anything to do until day when coach be to be attacked agreed must be well to take advice of friend tipstaff hitherto have not told more of motive for desiring to find nicholson than charlie have said at first interview with thought must be better now to make more fully acquainted with fact for have found shrewd eager to assist to best of power therefore sent boy with note to at court at seven o'clock came to lodging have found man charlie said a entered be very glad to hear gentleman have quite given up hope that must be able to do so thought must have left town altogether for time sit down take glass of wine want advice in matter unless know how much there be at stake will not be able to enter fully into affair four year ago fellow be concerned in plot by six gentleman among whom be friend be brought to ruin be in habit of meeting together being of similar political opinion advantage be taken of by man who hoped to profit largely by ruin especially by of father in order to bring about recommended fellow be in search of to father who happened at time to be in want of servant fellow undoubtedly acted a spy for once caught at spying alone must have be of use for there be nothing at time said must have brought harm upon simply discussed what thousand of other people have discussed measure must be taken on behalf of stuart if one of came over from france supported by french force fellow however swore that object of meeting be to arrange for assassination of william gave full detail of supposed plot in order to give substance to statement hid in cabinet of father number of compromising paper professing to be letter from abroad be found by officer sent to arrest father five friend managed to escape estate be forfeited of course what want to prove be connection between spy employer who for service in bringing supposed plot to light received a reward father estate there be way of doing unless man can be brought to confess own villainy in matter of letter to denounce scoundrel whose agent be probably by time have got nearly all can expect from employer will at least feel scruple in exposing if by so doing can save own neck now have not only discovered man have found out that be notorious highwayman leader of gang more have found out day hour on proposes to stop rob north coach well mr carstairs if have done that man said have done marvel that must find man might be piece of good luck that must have learned about seems to wonderful be lucky accident altogether saw watched managed to overhear conversation from gathered fact be simple enough of course idea be that must if possible catch in act of robbing coach bind take charge of saying that must hand over to justice when coachman passenger must of course appear to testify against instead of doing must take somewhere then give option of making clean breast of whole story remaining in custody until called upon to testify to statement in court of justice whenever required of being handed over to authority to be tried hung a highwayman one of greatest difficulty be how to effect capture attack will be made at night on coach in darkness might shoot might get away be at present in london at lodging in street behind abbey where doubtless real profession be altogether unsuspected by people of house now know whole affair let have opinion a to manner in have best set about business man sat for time in silence can think of better plan than yours sir yet seems to that there be scarcely chance of catching at coach of course must be easy enough if did not care whether killed caught must have to do must be to get dozen stout fellow armed with pistol on coach with instead of passenger then must be pretty certain to kill of perhaps a ca do be afraid to shoot lest must kill seems to that have very small chance of catching way charlie friend so thoroughly saw that sat silent when ceased speaking must not arrest now suppose harry said at last well see have got nothing against may have be knight of road for last five year have witness to prove be not much use to accuse of intending to rob north mail have proof even of that be only word against there be doubt that after have robbed coach will separate may go away in two singly now see know three of fellow hiding place must hardly choose one at barnet be too close be more likely must choose next place little inn in saw first think more likely still that mate will divide plunder mile so from place where stopped coach will then separate be inclined to think most likely course be to strike off from main road make long round come down before morning to where be now may take horse into stable more likely may leave at place may know of on road leading out through putney then arrive at lodging just about daybreak must explain have be at supper have kept up night one must even have suspicion have be engaged in affair with coach be sure be most likely plan then what must do harry asked what must do be will get two sharp active boy know of two who must just do have done job for before now will give exact description of two tavern send down day before coach be to be attacked tell that night be to keep watch over one of see who go in watch till come out then follow for day if necessary track down then can send word up by guard of coach day so that if find man doe not come back here by saturday morning will have news will put on track again before long however think be sure to come back here have better point out to evening where lodge will be able to find out before long whether be respectable people whether be likely to be pal of if be respectable will see on friday evening show badge tell that man who have be lodging here be notorious highwayman that be going to arrest to prevent chance of mistake will put three four of mate round house to see that one go out to give alarm will come down open door for at two o'clock in morning can then come up with into bedroom a come in will nab if on other hand find people of house have doubtful reputation in neighbourhood must simply hide in doorway make rush upon a go up to house overpower there if one stand in doorway leap out on a come up wo have much chance of using pistol will have cart ready close by will truss up tightly gag put into will have place ready for to drive to if think plan be a good a other think be excellent plan must not be better charlie exclaimed friend heartily agreed with think will be able to get anything out of when get there said tipstaff be sure to have of swag about even if none of passenger of coach be able to swear to talk overheard must be sufficient to hang can boy speak of write not sir there might be difficulty about verbal message guard will give right if get crown with need not trouble about sir will have man to meet coach a come in now have arranged matter sir will go with to see house will send sharp fellow down tomorrow to make inquiry about people of place when returned friend sat for long time talking together suggested plan looked so hopeful that felt confident of success think charlie harry said must be good thing for to present to duke of marlborough then will see if be disposed to take interest in help if be will tell have best be done towards getting nicholson statement made in presence of sort of official who will act on if give cold shoulder will have to do a best can in other direction will be well to have

remember that mischievous boy threw stone broke one of lattice pane of window where be sitting talking over little affair of north coach deep execration broke from lip of highwayman now see how know about charlie went on now entirely depends on whether in course of hour will hand over to magistrate a leader of gang who robbed north coach took part in robbery near dorking have found of watch other plunder in bedroom whether escape trial for offence may be wanted for other similar affair yes sir tony put in now see answer exactly to description of man officer have be in search of for long time go by name of dick cureton have be engaged in at least dozen highway robbery to knowledge see charlie went on there be doubt whatever what will happen if hand over to officer will be hung at tyburn to moral certainty there be getting out of now on other hand have alternative of making clean breast of dealing with john dormay of how put at lynnwood to act a spy how hid two letter gave in father cabinet how taught lying story afterwards told before magistrate at lancaster after having story written down will sign in presence of officer wife will also repeat that story before tribunal before may be brought know whether be hanging matter at rate can promise that will not be hung for duke of marlborough have taken matter in hand will have doubt be able to obtain for lesser punishment if make clean breast of say that will be let free be too dangerous man for at rate punishment will not be heavy one perhaps nothing worse than agreeing to serve in army understand that in case nothing will be said a to being dick cureton of connection with last coach robbery will appear before court simply a robert nicholson who having met captain jervoise felt constrained to confess grievous wrong did to father other gentleman at bidding of for money received from john dormay need time to make up mind highwayman said be certainly not going to be hung for advantage of john dormay who have paid

taking by collar made walk to house have asked question a to previous life have then given choice of going to jail of acting under instruction in case must be well rewarded naturally have chosen second alternative having completely under thumb john dormay have made sign paper acknowledging attempt at highway robbery upon rest of story be already known to hearer have several time overheard conversation in dining room have gathered nothing beyond talk of what must be done if pretender came over john dormay have taught story of assassination plot have given letter to hide now swore that whole story be false have be told entirely at dictation of john dormay from fear of consequence to if refused to obey order when have finished tony wife be called in made mark husband signed name a

clothes fit for appearance at court a at little gathering there be ceremony insisted must bring a be wife sarah went on hour ago in chair there will probably be two others possibly godolphin harley more likely courtier wife feel nervous hope after being accustomed to chat with charles of sweden to say nothing of czar of russia carstairs need not feel afraid of queen anne who be good nature nevertheless both young men felt nervous after being conducted up private stair duke led into oak panelled room of comparatively small size lighted by numerous taper displayed rich hanging furniture lady be sitting by fire tall handsome woman with somewhat imperious face stood on rug before talking to while pleasant looking man who by appearance manner might have be taken for country squire be

returned to other room then queen called upon young men to tell story charlie began related up to time when have aided in rescue of father from hand of escort harry told story of military experience then charlie related narrow escape at warsaw adventure with brigand fight with wolf be most exciting of queen said think that even general must rather have gone through battle of narva than have spent that night among wolf must indeed madam doubt if must have got a well through a captain carstairs did be sure madam will agree with that young gentleman ought to be fighting under flag rather than of sweden there be blame to for be most unjustly driven from country hope that by monday at time will have pleasure of presenting document for majesty signature stating that in opinion of council very grave miscarriage of justice have taken place that gentleman whose estate be four year ago confiscated be proved to be innocent of crime of be accused be true faithful subject of majesty that

to hear important evidence be produced by captain carstairs jervoise officer in service of king of sweden what have to say captain carstairs have sir only to testify that man who stand beside be robert nicholson who be in father employment for two year be believe principal witness against captain jervoise can also testify to identity now produce confession voluntarily made by man signed in presence of witness handed in confession be read aloud by clerk standing at lower end of table murmur of indignation arose from council a concluded have acted part of base villain lord normanby said to nicholson hanging must be too good for such caitiff what induced to make confession have long repented conduct man said be forced into acting a did by john dormay who might have have hung for highway robbery must long ago have told truth have known where to find gentleman have injured meeting by chance other day resolved upon making clean breast of to take what punishment lordship may think proper hoping however for clemency on account of fact be driven to act in way did one of judge who have former deposition before asked several question a to manner in have put paper into sir marmaduke cabinet replied that found key in vase on mantel after trying several lock with found that fitted cabinet statement agrees lord judge said with made by sir marmaduke carstairs in examination then said that must not account for paper being in cabinet for be never unlocked that kept key in vase on mantel where none must be likely to look for in short time present be requested to withdraw in

be clearly proven that have decided that sentence passed against in absence will be quashed will also recommend to majesty that sentence of confiscation against will be reversed a to sir seeing that have however tardily endeavoured to undo evil have caused be disposed to deal leniently at request of duke of marlborough have agreed if be ready to leave country enlist at once a soldier in army of flanders there to expiate fault by fighting in service of country will not recommend that proceeding will be taken against if at time return hither save a soldier with report of good conduct affair will be revived will receive full punishment deserve for present will be lodged in prison a will be needed to give evidence when matter of john dormay come up for hearing nicholson be at once removed in custody two young officer retired usher bringing whispered message from marlborough that have better not wait to see a council might sit for time longer that if must call at house at five o'clock after official reception must see be more than must have hoped for harry said a left saint james fortnight ago although have intention of giving up search began to think that chance of ever setting eye on rascal be of slightest now everything have come right man have be found have be made to confess whole matter case have be heard by council father be free to return to england estate be restored to at least council recommends queen know queen be ready to sign so that be a good a done seems too good to be true doe indeed charlie will be delighted across water think father counted at upon finding nicholson of getting to confess think have hoped that duke must interest to get order further proceeding must be taken in matter of alleged plot must have permitted to return to england spoke to several time of knowledge of duke when be young man churchill said be time server have certainly changed politics several time if man be fickle in politics may be so in friendship be great many year since have met marlborough might not have be inclined to acknowledge one charged with so serious crime a said to before started matter have changed since death of william marlborough stand far higher with anne than did with william leaning have certainly be all along jacobite now that tory be in power whig be out of favour marlborough must if chose do very much for be no longer crime to be jacobite indeed say that tory be intending to upset act of succession bring in fresh one making james stuart successor to anne still even if have succeeded so far by marlborough influence that father must have returned to england without fear of being tried for life think that of must have come so long a charge of having be concerned in assassination plot be hanging over now that be cleared can come back with honour will be different altogether will be glorious news for of course will start a soon a get official communication that estate be restored will only have to go back to for a know be only estate have be granted to anyone else others be put up for sale one must bid for a title deed must have be worth nothing if king james came over so have only be let to farmer can walk straight in again without dispossessing anyone know what to do about john dormay charlie said there be doubt that from what judge said will prosecute so ought to harry broke in have striven by false swearing to bring innocent men to scaffold why be worse than murder quite agree with harry if be in place must say just a strongly a do that ought to be hung see be differently situated man be kinsman of ours by marriage cousin celia have be always most kind to be nearest relative after father have be like aunt indeed did must to supply place of mother to be sure little sweetheart ciceley have be like sister must have be most terrible trial to be bad day for cousin celia when married that scoundrel be sure that have made life most unhappy one still for sake must not see villainy punished a deserves indeed for own since man be to certain extent kinsman besides harry a must remember well enough ciceley in boy girl fashion used to say must be day husband wife have never since seen anyone whom must so soon marry a bonny little cousin if ciceley be of same mind maybe day other may come to lynnwood a mistress must hardly be if father be hung for attempting to swear away life of mine indeed charlie know how fond be of cousin indeed harry there be talk between father cousin celia few month before trouble came of formal betrothal between have not be for coolness between father must have taken place yes remember now telling about charlie well what be to be done for agree with that if possible john dormay must escape from punishment deserves how be to be done well harry week two will make difference to father will have expectation of hearing from for long time to come must say be best must go down warn will be glad if will go with of course will go harry said indeed be best that warning came from man be villain reckless one in passion when hears that rascality be known prize for schemed snatched from very life in danger might even seek to vent rage spite upon now be clear charlie that must not very well kill man afterwards marry daughter thing must be scarce seemly fellow be kinsman of mine have grievously injured must kill without smallest compunction thereby rid world of scoundrel of prospective father in law of most objectionable kind charlie laughed harry will have killing will go down see together will let know that order be probably already on road for arrest that have best lose not hour at once cross water must not think that must wish to encumber with woman for never thought showed least affection to either wife daughter at rate will see that doe not take with will tell that if go go alone will do best to hush up matter that so long a remains abroad tale of villainy will never be told that if return confession of nicholson will be published throughout country even if prosecution be brought against when called upon duke shook warmly by hand parchment be royal assent to decision of council that estate of inculpated in alleged plot for assassination of late king must be forthwith restored to having be clearly proved that have be falsely accused of said crime that majesty be satisfied that gentleman be true loyal subject think may say duke continued with smile affair of state have ever be so promptly conducted carried through feel how deeply indebted be for good fortune to kindness grace charlie said know for month might have elapsed even year before
