thought over plan man who have few hour before so sumptuously entertained military civilian of cawnpore man who be universally regarded a firm friend of british one of best fellow going day week passed on messenger came went storm be slowing brewing yet to men seemed that india be never more contented outlook more tranquil assured chapter ii young man in suit of brown karkee with white puggaree wound round pith helmet be just mounting in front of bungalow at deennugghur forty mile from cawnpore when two others came up way be going to ride bathurst be going out to narkeet there be dispute between villager talookdar a to limit have got to look into case why do ask hunter thought that might be going way know have have several report of ravage by man eater whose headquarters seem to be big jungle pas through on way to narkeet have be paying visit to several village in neighborhood have carried off two mail runner must advise to keep sharp lookout yes have heard plenty about be unfortunate have one at station who go in for tiger hunting young bloxam be speaking to last night be very hot about a know nothing about shooting have never fired off rifle in life except at military target told that be madness to think of by that have better ride down to regiment at cawnpore get to form party to come up to hunt beast told need not bring elephant with must get a many a be necessary from of talookdars there will be want of beater said must write at once doubted whether of must be able to get away at present general inspection be just coming on however doubt will be able to do so before long well if be must put pair of pistol into holster bathurst must be awfully awkward if came across beast never carry firearm young man said shortly then more lightly be peaceful man by profession a be mr hunter leave firearm to whose profession be to use have hitherto never met with occasion when needed be not likely to do so always carry heavy hunting whip find useful sometimes when village dog rush out pretend that be going to attack fancy that even oude swordsman must think twice before attacking when have in hand of course there be fear about tiger generally ride pretty fast even if be lying by roadside waiting for meal think must be likely to interfere with so saying lightly touched horse flank with spur cantered off be fine young fellow garnet mr hunter said to companion full of energy say very best linguist in oude yes be that other agreed be sort of fellow one doe not quite understand like man who be like other fellow bathurst be doe shoot doe ride mean care for pig sticking never go in for fun there may be on hand just work nothing else doe not seem to mix with other people be sort of fellow one must say have got sort of secret connected with if have be certain be nothing to personal disadvantage mr hunter said warmly have known for last six year wo say very well for think anyone doe that except perhaps doctor wade when there be wing of regiment up here three year ago bathurst took to other very much perhaps because be different from other people anyhow from what know of bathurst believe to be very fine character though there be certainly amount of reserve about altogether unusual at rate service be gainer by never knew fellow work so indefatigably will take very high place in service before have done be not so sure of that other said be man with opinion of own sort of crotchet fad have be in hot water with chief commissioner more than once when be over at lucknow last be chatting with two three men name happened to crop up one of said 'bathurst be sort of knight errant official don quixote perhaps best officer in province in respect hopelessly impracticable ' yes can quite understand garnet that sort of man be never popular with higher official whose liking go to man who doe too much too little who doe work without questioning never think of making suggestion be mere official machine men of bathurst type who go to bottom of thing protest against what consider unfair decision send in memorandum showing that superior be hopelessly ignorant idiotically wrong be always cordially disliked still generally work way to front in long run well must be off bathurst rode to narkeet without drawing rein horse at time slackened pace on own accord almost mechanical motion from rider heel soon started off again at rapid pace at rider ordinarily traveled from time left deennugghur to arrival at narkeet thought of dreaded man eater entered bathurst mind be deeply meditating on memorandum be about to draw up respecting decision have be arrived at in case between talookdar in district government in a appeared to wholly erroneous unjust view have be taken a to merit of case only roused when horse broke into walk a entered village two three of head men with many bow salutation of respect came out to receive lord sahib have seen nothing of tiger head man said heart be melted with fear for evil beast be heard roaring in jungle not far from road early morning never gave thought one way other bathurst said a dismounted horse must have let know if brute have be anywhere near see that be tied up in shed have food water put boy to keep fly from worrying now let get to business first of must go through village record document after will question four five of oldest inhabitant then must go over ground whole question turn know upon whether irrigation ditch mentioned in talookdar grant be one run across at foot of rising ground on side whether be one sweep round on side of grove with little temple in unfortunately most of best land lie between ditch for hour bathurst listened to statement of old people of village cross questioning closely sparing effort to sift truth from confused often contradictory evidence then spent two hour going over ground endeavoring to satisfy of two ditch be one named in village record have two day before taken equal pain in sifting evidence on other side trust lord see there can be no doubt a to justice of claim head man said humbly a prepared to mount again according to point of view there be doubt about childee then there be equally doubt other way according to statement put forward be generally way in land dispute for good hard swearing hindoo cultivator can be matched against world unfortunately there be nothing either in grant in neighbor that specifies unmistakably of ancient ditch be one referred to present impression be that be essentially case for compromise know final decision doe not rest on will be out here again next week will write to talookdar to meet here will go over ground together again see if can not arrange line will be fair to party if can do that matter must be settled without expense trouble whereas if go up to lucknow may have to be gone into again if decision be given against a far a can see be just a likely to be one way a will be serious thing for village be in lord hand native said be protector of poor will do justice will do justice childee must do justice to other side too of course of will be satisfied that can not be helped perfect knowledge of language pain took to sift matter brought before to bottom have rendered young officer very popular among native knew must get justice from direct there be necessity to bribe underling have knack of extracting truth from mass of lying evidence always forthcoming in native case even defeated party admired manner in fabric of falsehood be pulled to piece main reason of popularity be sympathy real interest showed in case patience with listened to story bathurst a rode homewards be still thinking of case of course there have be lying on side to that be accustomed be question of importance of greater importance doubt to villager than to opponent still important to for tract of land be valuable one of considerable extent there be really nothing in document produced on side to show ditch be intended by original grant evidently at time be made very many year before one ditch other be not in existence there be proof a to be more recent although side professed that tradition handed down to asserted ditch on side to be more recent be riding

experience way have doctor hope will have benefit of assistance in future a have aboard ship will do best doctor said grimly british subaltern be pretty well impervious to snub belongs to pachydermatous family of animal armor of self conceit render invulnerable against milder form of raillery however think can be trusted to hold own with miss hannay without much assistance from major real difficulty will lie rather in struggle against united female force of station why will have to struggle with isobel asked in surprise while uncle broke into laugh frighten doctor be not so easily

to herself be little cottage with bright garden in suburb of london where robert must live together must go out a daily governess robert who be learning to play organ must hoped get post a organist not of course for sake of salary for earnings interest of thousand pound must be hers when came of age must be sufficient for a amusement for to give sense of independence when be just seventeen be looking forward to time when must begin to carry plan into effect terrible blow came heard from mother that robert be dead be sad blow for mr hannay wrote a know have never be strong still have idea that anything serious ailed until heard fortnight since be suffering from violent cough have lost strength rapidly week later heard that doctor be of opinion be case of sudden consumption that end be rapidly approaching went up to town to see found even worse than expected be in way surprised when morning received letter saying that have gone great a be blow one can not feel that terribly

important letter from uncle dear isobel when first wrote to told that what be most looking forward to be to make home for brother own be blow to for have long have plan of own about however thought desire to help brother be so natural must give such happiness in carrying into effect that at once fell in with put aside own plan case be altered now can see reason why can not have own way when be in england made up mind that unless married be most improbable contingency must when be old enough have out to keep house for foresaw even then that brother might prove obstacle to plan even in short time be with be easy enough to see that charge of must fall on shoulder that must be labor of love to if lived then felt must not leave that must be right in not doing so even then seemed likely to that must not grow up to manhood from time to time have be in correspondence with clergyman be with learned that doctor who attended thought poorly of have taken to two first class physician in london pronounced to be constitutionally weak said that beyond strengthening medicine sort of thing must hing for therefore dear be surprise to when received first mother letter with news then own written few day later when answered that letter thought a well not to say anything of plan by time receive will be six month since great loss will be able to look at in fairer light than must have done then do hope will agree to come out to life here have advantage disadvantage think that especially for young people be pleasant one be getting very tired of bachelor establishment will be very great pleasure indeed to have here ever since be in england made up mind to adopt a own child be very like brother john letter have heard of show that have grown up just a must have wished to do sister helena be mother child without wishing to hurt feeling mother have nothing in common regard a only relation have in world whether come out whether leave behind will be yours do hope that will at rate

after receipt of letter will look most anxiously for letter from saying that will come that will start by sailing ship in month at latest from date of writing isobel did not hesitate a faith in uncle be unbounded next to meeting with brother letter have be greatest pleasure have always taken part be who at request have robert placed at school have kept at miss virtue in spite of mother complaint at home have never felt comfortable have always seemed to that be in way mother disapproved of while from helena have never have sisterly word to go out to india to see wonder have read of to be uncle companion seemed perfectly delightful prospect answer to uncle be sent off day after received letter day month stepped on board indiaman in london dock intervening time have not be pleasant one mr hannay have heard from major of wish intention regarding isobel be greatly displeased thereat why must have chosen instead of helena said angrily to isobel on first day of arrival home suppose because thought must suit better mamma really see why must be upset about suppose helena must have liked to go be sure must not have liked to have have with instead of must have thought must have be pleased be off hand altogether doe seem to that have ever be really glad to have about have be entirely own fault mr hannay said have always be headstrong determined to go own way have never be fit to be seen when anyone came have thwarted in way be very sorry mamma think might have be better if have have little more patience with even now if really wish to stay at home will do so can write again to uncle tell have changed mind certainly not mr hannay said naturally must wish to have child with doubt whether being here must be for happiness of of besides wish uncle money to go out of family might take into head to leave to hospital for black woman still must have be only right proper that must at rate have given first choice a for instant acceptance of offer without even consulting nothing can surprise in way after general conduct towards however although mr hannay declined to take interest in isobel preparation continued to behave a injured person helena be sorry at heart for arrangement have be made objected very strongly to isobel plan of going out a governess upon other hand presence at home must in many way have be inconvenience two can make better appearance on fixed income than three can presence at home must have necessitated many small economy be too disturbing element others understood other perfectly felt that in way understood isobel altogether be much better that must go a to heirship captain hannay have spoken freely a to monetary affair when have be in england after brother death pay be amply sufficient for want said everything be expensive out there have have occasion to save have few hundred pound laid by so that if break down be ordered to europe at time on sick leave can live comfortably for time beyond there have be reason why must lay by be not likely ever to marry when have served full time pension will be ample for want in england will do best to help if help be necessary fortunately interest of thousand apiece girl be left by aunt will help income when be necessary to do anything for robert poor lad will take expense on thought indian came home with lot of money mr hannay said complainingly not military do fighting get fairly paid for civilian get five time a highly paid run risk why must be so one have ever attempted to explain there be sister mr hannay therefore although complained of partiality shown to isobel be well aware that major saving must amount to very great sum although in nine year with higher rank better pay might have added good bit to little store of have spoken to when week before vessel sailed dr wade appeared with letter have received from major asking to take charge of isobel on voyage mr hannay conceived violent objection to have in fact be by mean pleased with commission have arrived in unusually aggressive snappish humor cut short mr hannay well turned sentence ruthlessly aggrieved by remarking on helena want of color recommending plenty of walking exercise taken at brisk pace more ease comfort in matter of dress daughter lung have room to play madam said heart be compressed one can expect to be healthy under such circumstance have own medical attendant dr wade mr hannay said decidedly doubt madam doubt can say be if recommendation be not same a mine must be downright fool very well miss hannay think understand other will be on board by eleven o'clock will keep sharp lookout for be later than twelve will warp out of dock by one at latest if miss that only plan will be to take train down to tilbury hire boat there will be in time sir isobel said well hope will experience of woman be pretty extensive have scarcely met one who must be relied upon to keep appointment punctually laden more than can help with little bag parcel bundle of kind expect will be three four in cabin will find that there be room for litter take thing will require at first in one two flat trunk will stow under berth once week so if weather be fine will be able to get at thing in hold do try if possible to pack thing that be likely to want to get at during voyage in one trunk have star mark like painted on trunk with name then there will be occasion for sailor to haul twenty box upon deck be sure send trunk on board except want in cabin two day before sail do think can remember think so dr wade very well then be off doctor shook hand with isobel nodded to mr hannay helena hurried away what perfectly detestable little man mr hannay exclaimed a door closed over uncle must have be out of sens to select odious person to look after on voyage really pity isobel have doubt be very much nicer than seems mamma uncle said know in letter last week that have written to dr wade to look after if a thought probable might be coming out in same ship said that be little brusque in manner that be general favorite one of kindest hearted of men little brusque mr hannay repeated scornfully if be only considered little brusque in india can say be society must be in lamentable state out there uncle say be great shikari have probably killed more tiger than man in india really see that be recommendation isobel although might be if be likely to encounter tiger on board ship however be not surprised that opinion differs from mine very seldom see matter in same light only hope may be right may be wrong for otherwise journey be not likely to be very pleasant one for personally must almost a soon have bengal tiger loose about ship than very rude unmannerly person a dr wade mr hannay helena accompanied isobel to dock went on board ship with doctor received at gangway be in better temper for fact that be on point of starting for india again have put in high spirit escorted party below saw that got lunch showed isobel be cabin introduced to two three lady of acquaintance made so

necessary to get ship out of dock at once now miss hannay if will take advice doctor said a soon a ship be fairly in stream will go below get out thing will want from box get matter tidy comfortable in first place will do good to be busy in second place there be nothing like getting everything shipshape in cabin very first thing after starting then be ready for rough weather anything else may occur have got chair thought very likely must not think of passenger without chair of own be most forlorn creature can tell when have done down below will find somewhere aft if must not do so look out for chair with own name on take possession of think be sure to see before have be fortnight at sea isobel came to like doctor thoroughly knew many of passenger on board byculla have soon many

in cantonment at bhurtpore where husband be stationed at time pulled tooth out for once halloaed louder than woman ever heard mean to say dear that woman holloa louder than men on contrary bear pain good deal better be exception be twelve year younger then used to dress good deal more than doe now cloak bonnet be meant to convey to rest of passenger fact that there be occasion whatever for person of importance to attend to such petty matter a dress never mention husband name without saying bey husband resident for be kind hearted woman very kind hearted woman pulled child of hers through who be down with fever at bhurtpore have very close shave of have never forgotten greeted when came on board almost with tear in eye at thought of time told have young lady under charge said that must be very pleased to do anything must for be stanch friend be mr resident will find useful before get to end of voyage lady received isobel with genuine kindness took very much under wing during voyage isobel received small advantage from advice protection own good sense however earnest life have led at school with brother at home must have sufficed even without guardianship that of doctor there be straightforward frankness about kept men from talking nonsense to compliment simply laughed at attempt at flattery made angry doctor afterwards declared to uncle must not have believed that guardianship of girl upon long indian voyage must possibly have caused so little trouble annoyance when read letter major hair stood on end if leave have not be up must have canceled passage come by next ship indeed when went down to see have still by mean made up mind a to whether must not take chance of getting out in time by next vessel however liked appearance a have said turned out excellently must not mind making voyage in charge of chapter v two day after arrival at cawnpore dr wade moved into quarter of own like dr wade very much indeed know uncle still be glad to have to to settle down into regular way yes have got to learn to know other isobel do think so uncle why seems to that know about just same a if have always be together be sure always told about even when be bad at school got into scrape because said particularly that liked to tell everything did not want to know only good side of yes be so dear doubt have fair idea a to what be strong point be weak one one other affect greatly person ordinary everyday character be little thing trifle way of talking way of listening amount of sympathy shown so on make man woman popular people ask whether may be morally sleeping volcano who if fairly roused might slay rival burn city simply look at surface be man woman pleasant agreeable easily pleased ready to take share in making thing go to show certain amount of sympathy in other people pleasure trouble in fact to form pleasant unit of society of station so in house might be most angelic temper in world if wore creaky boot have habit of slamming door little trick of giggling fidgeting with hand foot must be unpleasant companion for must be constantly irritating one in small matter of course be just same thing with opinion of have idea be good enough sort of fellow because have done best to enable to carry out plan wish have nothing to do at with character a man to live with till saw other when got out of gharry really knew nothing whatever of other isobel shook head decidedly nothing will persuade that did know everything about uncle be just exactly what knew must be in look voice in manner way everything of course be partly from what remember really did not see great deal of in day be from letter think entirely that knew about exactly what be do mean to say that be not just what thought must be well not so clearly a that isobel of course be only little child when saw except that have big brown eye long eyelash confess that struck that be rather plain little thing think that mother letter since conveyed to mind fact that there have be material change since therefore own be personally quite different from what have expected to find have expected to find think rather stumpy in figure square in build with very determined businesslike manner nonsense uncle must not have expected that well dear did see find be utterly wrong be not discontented uncle isobel asked with smile dear perhaps not quite so contented a may think ought to be why be that uncle well dear if have be what have pictured might have have four five year to myself possibly might even have gone home with to keep house for in england when retire a be now give six month at outside what nonsense uncle suppose be going to fall in love with first man who present why everyone say sea voyage be most trying time see came through quite scathless besides uncle laughed there be safety in multitude think that girl must be far more likely to fall in love in country place where only saw one two men than where there be number of besides seems to that in india girl can not feel that be chosen a be from among other girl a must do at home there be so few girl so many men here there must be sort of feeling that be only appreciated because there be nothing better to be have of course uncle can understand that idea of love making marrying never entered head at until went on board ship a know always used to think that robert must live together be quite sure must never have left if have lived if have stopped in england must have done work have trained to do might have be year year perhaps never before anyone might have taken fancy to to seems strange really think pleasant uncle for everyone to take for granted that because girl come out to india be candidate for marriage think be degrading uncle doctor be telling yesterday that have idea of sort major said with slight smile think girl often start with sort of idea be like looking on at game feel interested in until begin to play at well longer entertain idea better will be pleased isobel only hope that

succumbed at once mutual animosity succeeded close friendship have hitherto entertained for other travers senior captain man who have hitherto be noted for indifference to charm of female society went so far a to admit that miss hannay be very nice unaffected girl mr doolan be quite enthusiastic about be very lucky jim said to husband that be sober respected married man before came out that be installed here a lawful wedded wife instead of being at ballycrogin with only engagement ring on finger know susceptible nature must have fallen in love with must not have have must of have be miserable how do know must have have norah because dear will be able to pick choose just where like though one recognizes virtue more than do company in indian regiment be hardly a attractive a residency lieutenant governorship seriously be dear girl a yet doe not seem to have least idea how pretty be how cordially of will hate anticipate great fun in looking on be out of sort of thing be news to norah think be just a fond of quiet flirtation a used to be just of very little one jim fortunately not more so can look on complacently even have suffered why for week not day have passed without young richards dropping in for chat when came in yesterday must talk about nothing miss hannay until shut up by telling be extremely bad form to talk to one lady about boy colored up till almost laughed in face in fact believe did laugh will warrant did norah must not help especially when assured be perfectly serious about miss hannay did not encourage hope norah told colonel set face against married subaltern that must injure seriously in profession if be to think of thing a knew have nothing pay must be fatal to captain doolan went off into burst of laughter took in did not see that be humbugging altogether not bit of be very amusing boy jim be really quite sorry for richards told must get over in time for a far a must learn have be just a bad thirty three time before finally took pity on that only did then because be wearing away with trouble advised to put best face must on for miss hannay must be last person to be pleased if be to be going about with face a long a if have just come from aunt funeral race meeting came off three week after miss hannay arrived at cawnpore have be to several dinner party by time began to know most of regular resident race served

when be two three year old be married at twelve even if party be agreed husband relation wife relation everyone else what be going to teach child worth knowing before get to age of twelve just enough to make discontented with lot once get native to alter custom to marry woman at age of eighteen may do something for a long a stick to idiotic custom of marrying off when be still child case be hopeless there be something wanted to ask doctor isobel said know be first time have have anything to do with entertaining know nothing about decorating table uncle say that be great hand at

getting back up thank goodness indian servant give air english one do human nature be good deal same everywhere first great rule if want domestic arrangement to go off well be to keep servant in good temper none of like to be interfered with doctor wise man be always ready to be taught doctor said sententiously well there be exception doctor remember soon after joined man blew off two of finger young surgeon who be here wanted to amputate hand be just going to set about when staff surgeon came in said that have better not be done for native must not stand amputation young surgeon be very much annoyed staff surgeon went away next day there be good deal of inflammation young surgeon decided to amputate man never rallied from operation died next day said major that wise man be always

amputated man must have be right three week afterwards knew nothing about soft hearted hindoo never dreamt that operation must be trifle to englishman must be fatal to one of simply because although be plucky enough in respect have more heart than mouse when anything be matter with yes if have be for old colonel who gave private hint to say nothing about affair merely to put down in report 'died from effect of gunshot wound ' must have got into deuce of scrape over affair a be only cost hundred rupee to satisfy man family send back to native village be for year standing joke against miss hannay except uncle colonel there be one left in regiment who be there be sore subject for long time still doubt be useful lesson rule have be ever since never amputate except a forlorn hope even then amputate for if do relative of man a far a fourth cousin will inevitably regard a murderer well must be off will look in tomorrow morning major make inspection of resource be glad to see hunter be going to bring over carriage major said two day later a looked through letter be very glad of for put off till too late have be trying everywhere for last two day to hire one be engaged have be so for

countryman being thrown entirely into scale on side if trouble must ever arise own what say make doubt must always take opinion of dog child about anyone in preference to own be not very complimentary doctor isobel laughed well dear young girl who have not mixed much in world have instinct blunted be in respect very much like child may be deceived constantly be deceived where heart be concerned be

accommodation for single company at station two subaltern occupied large square tent while other three officer took possession of only three bungalow be vacant at station doctor having tent to major isobel have stayed for first three day with hunter at end of time bungalow have be put in perfect order be far le commodious than at cawnpore isobel be well satisfied with when belonging have be arranged soon declared that greatly preferred deennugghur to cawnpore at station heartily welcomed accession to number there be entire absence of stiffness formality of large cantonment like cawnpore isobel be free to run in a chose to spend morning chatting working with hunter mr doolan with other lady of whom there be three at station few day after arrival news came in that famous man eater have for time ceased ravage moved off to different part of country principally because native of village near jungle have ceased altogether to go out after nightfall have returned have carried off herdsman on two consecutive day doctor at once prepared for action agreed to allow wilson richards to accompany next day three rode off together to narkeet to village two herdsman have belonged have be killed near same spot native have traced return of tiger to lair in jungle with victim doctor soon found that ordinary method of destroying tiger have be tried again again without success cattle goat have be tied up native shikaris have taken post in tree close by have watched all night in vain spring trap deadfalls have also be tried tiger seemed absolutely indifferent to attraction of bait always on lookout for snare attempt made at dozen village near jungle have be equally unsuccessful be evident doctor said that brute care for nothing human victim doubt if be very hungry must take cow goat might wait very long time for so only thing can see be to act a bait how will do doctor will build sort of cage near point where tiger have twice entered jungle will take with in cage woman girl from village from time to time will cry out a if in pain a tiger be evidently somewhere in neighborhood be likely enough will come out to see about must have cage pretty strong will never get anyone to sit with besides on dark night there be calculating on killing to certainty with first shot be just a well to be on safe side in daylight must be different matter altogether can rely upon weapon when can see on dark night be pretty well guesswork villager be at once engaged to erect stout cage eight foot square four high of beam driven into ground six inch apart roofed in with strong bar there be considerable difficulty in getting anyone to consent to sit by doctor at last widow of one of men who have be killed agreed for sum of twenty five rupee to pas night there accompanied by child four year old doctor skill with rifle be notorious be rather desire of seeing husband death avenged than for sake of money that consented to keep watch there be one tree suitable for watcher stood forty yard to right of cage be arranged that subaltern must take station in now look here lad doctor said before start on business must be quite settled that fire till hear rifle be first thing second be that only fire when brute be fair distance from cage if get excited blaze away anyhow be quite a likely to hit a be tiger now object to take risk whatever on score will have native shikari in tree with to point out tiger for be twenty to one against making out for yourselves will be quite indistinct have chance of making out head anything of sort have to take shot at a best may remember there must not be word spoken if brute doe come will probably make two three turn round cage before approach may likely enough pas close to in case fire ca make sure of killing if be only wounded must make off into jungle trouble must be thrown away also remember must not smoke tiger must smell mile away besides sound of match striking must be quite sufficient to set on guard there be objection hope doctor to taking up flask will want something to keep from going to sleep there be objection to that doctor said mind go to sleep for if did might fall off bough break neck to say nothing of chance of tiger happening to be close at hand at time late in afternoon doctor went down to inspect cage pronounced sufficiently strong hour before nightfall woman child took place in two beam in roof have be left unfastened to allow of entry be securely lashed in place by villager wilson richards be helped up into tree took place upon two bough sprang from trunk close to other at height of twelve foot from ground shikari who be to wait with crawled out with hatchet chopped off of small bough foliage so a to give clear view of ground for distance round cage be erected in center of patch of brushwood lower portion of have be cleared out so that doctor must have uninterrupted view round bough leaf be gathered up by villager carried away by watch began confound richards whispered to companion after night fell be getting a dark a pitch can scarcely make out clump where cage be must hardly see elephant if be to come much le brute like tiger will get accustomed to presently wilson replied at rate make quite sure of direction in cage be in be better to let twenty tiger go than to run risk of hitting doctor in hour eye have become accustomed to darkness must not only see clump in cage be clearly must make out outline of bush round open space in stood started a loud dismal wail rose suddenly in air followed by violent cry by jove how woman made jump wilson said sounded quite awful must have pinched that poor little beggar of hers pretty sharply to make yell like low hush from shikari at elbow warned wilson that be speaking too loudly hour passed by cry being raised at interval be enough to give one jump richards time yell nearly fall off branch keep on listening then wo startle fellow ca keep on listening wilson grumbled listen time until ear begin to sing feel stupid sleepy then go off again like steam whistle child will be black blue over in morning warning hiss from shikari again induced wilson to silence believe brute be coming whispered hour later if be for bough being so hard must drop off to sleep eye ache with staring at bush a spoke shikari touched on shoulder pointed tiger whispered then did same to richards grasping rifle gazed in direction in pointed must for time make out nothing then saw dim gray mass in front of bush directly on opposite side of open space then from cage lying almost in direct line between rose cry of child be of at certain that object at be gazing be tiger seemed shapeless outline fading away in bush felt sure that have noticed nothing like in direction before for two three minute remained in uncertainty then outline seemed to broaden moved noiselessly there must be mistake now tiger have be attracted by cry a moved along must see that be making circuit of spot from whence sound proceeded to reconnoiter before advancing prey kept close to line of bush sometimes passed behind of shikari pressed shoulder low hiss enforced necessity for absolute silence two young fellow almost held breath have lost sight of tiger now knew must be approaching for two three minute heard saw nothing then shikari pointed beyond almost started a saw tiger retreating knew that must have passed almost under without noticing at last reached spot at have first seen child cry time low querulous again rose with quicker step than before moved on still not directly towards center to great relief of two subaltern who have feared that might attack from such direction that must not dare to fire for fear of hitting cage fortunately passed that point crouching moved towards bush wilson richards have rifle now at shoulder in feeble uncertain light felt by mean sure of hitting mark though be thirty yard away almost breathlessly listened for doctor rifle started when flash sharp crack broke on stillness there be sudden snarl of pain tiger gave spring in air then fell rolling over over be not killed shikari exclaimed fire when get up suddenly rose to foot with loud roar sprang towards thicket two subaltern fired movement of dimly seen creature be so swift that felt by mean sure that have hit then came almost simultaneously loud shriek from woman of very different character to long wail have before uttered followed by sound of rending tearing be breaking down cage richards exclaimed excitedly a wilson hastened to ram cartridge down rifle come must go help doctor moment later came report of rifle then be silent then doctor voice be heard get down from tree yet lad think be dead be best to make sure first there be pause then rifle shot followed by shout all right be a dead a door nail now mind rifle a climb down fancy thinking of wilson said when have just killed tiger have capped mine yet have richards have just put on will take off again here old man get down first will hand gun to to shikari with difficulty scrambled down from tree now may a well cap rifle richards said brute may not be dead after approached bush cautiously be quite sure be dead doctor quite sure do think know when tiger be dead still holding gun in readiness to fire approached bush can do good until villager come with torch doctor said tiger be dead enough be always a well to be prudent shikari have uttered loud cry a sprang down from tree have be answered by shout from distance in few minute light be seen through tree score of men with torch lantern ran up with shout of satisfaction a soon a arrived two young officer advanced to cage on top tiger be lying stretched out a if in sleep with caution approached flashed torch in eye there be doubt that be dead body be quickly rolled off cage then dozen hand cut lashing lifted top bar be deeply scored by tiger claw doctor emerged be glad to be out of that said six hour in cage with woman cry brat be joke a soon a doctor have got out subaltern eagerly examined tiger upon native be heaping curse execration how many wound have got asked doctor who repeated question to shikari in own language three sahib one full in chest must have be mortal two others in rib by heart others subaltern exclaimed in disgust a answer be translated to doctor examined tiger missed lad need not be ashamed of that be easy matter to hit tiger even at short distance on dark night like when can scarce make out ca see barrel of rifle ought to have told to rub little phosphorus off head of match onto sight be so accustomed to do a matter of course did not think of telling well be heartily glad have killed for by account have done immense deal of damage have be fine tiger in time although skin doe look much wilson said there be patch of fur off be generally case with man eater be mostly old tiger who take when get past strength to killing men know whether flesh doe agree with be almost always mangy be afraid for moment richards said that tiger be going to break into cage heard clawing away at timber a did fire again be afraid something be matter mother be doctor said testily moment tiger sprang woman threw down at full length right on top of second rifle when went to push off think fancied tiger have got hold of for gave yell fairly made jump have to push off by main force then lie down on back so a to get rifle up to fire be sure first shot be fatal for knew just where heart must be dropped second cartridge in gave bullet so a to make sure well if of want head claw have better say so at once for native will be singeing whisker off directly practice be superstition of theirs want wilson said if have put bullet into brute so must have said helped to kill must have liked head to get preserved sent home to people a be native be welcome to a far a be concerned richards be of same opinion so without further delay started back for village where upon arrival be greeted with cry of joy by woman news having already be carried back by boy poor beggar doctor said have be living life of terror for week must feel a if have woke from nightmare now lad will have supper dare say be ready for be sure be be there chance for supper doctor why must be two o'clock in morning of course there be doctor replied gave order to man to begin to warm up food a soon a heard gun fired will guarantee have got everything ready by time after hearty meal cigar lay down for few hour sleep at daybreak rode back to deennugghur two subaltern rather crestfallen at failure to have taken active part in killing tiger have so long be terror to district be awful sell missing miss hannay wanted to have have claw mounted a necklace thought must have liked be very much obliged to mr wilson must much rather not have have if tiger have be man eater must not have minded must never have worn a ornament claw have killed lot of people woman child too never thought of miss hannay must have be pleasant now one think of still wish have put bullet into doubt will do better next time mr wilson doctor have be telling that be extremely difficult to hit animal in dark when be not accustomed to sort of shooting say be in great fright time be lying in cage that be immense relief to when heard rifle go off found that be hit be too bad of miss hannay wilson laughed be not such duffer a that believe really did think so be sure be in earnest mr wilson said must have felt quite safe if have be daylight that in dark people really ca see way rifle be pointed that remembered have not told to put phosphorus on sight be too bad of grumbled must have served right if one of bullet have hit timber of cage given start must like to have seen doctor struggling in dark to get second rifle from under woman with tiger clawing growling two foot above doctor did tell about isobel laughed though said have woman child with to attract tiger must have frightened decent minded tiger miss hannay instead of attracting for such dismal yell a woman made never listened to nearly tumbled off tree at first of made jump so gave feeling of cold water running down back a to child know whether pinched doctor stuck pin into poor little brute howled in most frightful way think will ever want to go tiger shooting in dark again ache over today a if have be playing in first football match of season from sitting balancing on branch be almost over dozen time expect nearly went off to sleep mr wilson think must have gone to sleep if have be for woman miss hannay must not have minded if must have smoked to sit there hour after hour not be able to smoke not allowed to speak staring time into darkness till eye ached be trying can tell after not to hit brute be too bad day passed quietly at deennugghur be seldom alone at major hannay bungalow in evening for wilson richards generally came in to smoke cigar in veranda doctor be regular visitor when be not away in pursuit of game bathurst be also often one of party mr bathurst be coming out wonderfully miss hannay mr hunter said one day a isobel sat working with while two girl be practicing duet on piano in next room used to call hermit be so difficult to get out of cell be quite surprised when accepted invitation to dinner yesterday think dr wade have stirred up isobel said calmly be great favorite of doctor mr hunter smiled over work perhaps so dear anyhow be glad have come out hope wo retire into cell again after have gone suppose depends good deal upon work isobel said experience of men be that can always make time if like dear when man say be too busy to do other may always safely put down that doe want to do of course be just same thing with often hear woman say be too busy to attend to sort of thing that ought to attend to same woman can find plenty of time to go to pleasure gathering come off there be doubt that mr bathurst be really fond of work that be indefatigable civil servant of company must not prevent making hour two time of evening occasionally if wanted to however seems to have turned over new leaf hope will last in small station like even one man be of importance especially when be a pleasant a mr bathurst can be when like be in army at one time know be mr hunter yes never heard say so have heard so from several people think be only in for year so suppose did not care for can quite imagine must not so sold out short time afterwards obtained civil appointment have very good interest father be general bathurst who be know very distinguished officer so have difficulty in getting into service where be entirely in element father died two year ago believe came into good property at home everyone expected must have thrown up appointment made difference to just went on a before working a if have to depend entirely on service can quite understand isobel said to really earnest man life of usefulness here must be vastly preferable to living at home without anything to do object in life well perhaps so dear in theory be doubt case practically fancy must find nineteen men out of twenty even if be what call earnest men retire from rank of hard worker if come into nice property by way must come in here evening there be juggler in station mr hunter have told to come round servant say man be very celebrated juggler one of best in india a girl have never seen anything better than ordinary itinerant conjurer husband have arranged for to come in here have be sending note round asking everyone to come in have sent one round to place must have come out before chit arrived oh must like very much isobel said two three men came to bungalow at cawnpore did conjuring be nothing particular uncle say of do wonderful thing thing that can not account for at be one of thing read about at school thought must like to see more than anything in india when be at school went in body two three time to see conjurer when came to cheltenham of course did not understand thing did seemed wonderful to know there be people who can explain that be only trick have read account of thing done by juggler in india seemed utterly impossible to explain really sort of magic have heard good many argument about mr hunter said good many people especially who have seen most of be of opinion that many of feat of indian juggler can not be explained by natural law know of have seen very curious thing very fact that did not understand how be done be proof must not be explained certainly two of commonest trick basket trick mango have never be explained conjurer at home can do something like then be on stage where can have trapdoors sort of thing while be done anywhere in garden on road where there must be possible preparation with crowd of looker on round make quite uncomfortable to look at well must be off now mr hunter be nearly time for uncle to be back like to be in when return chapter ix dr wade be sitting in veranda smoking reading english paper have arrived by morning mail when isobel returned good morning doctor be uncle back not yet told might be hour late be to come round amuse until came back so in absence have be amusing doctor have be round at mr hunter be going to have juggler there evening be to go yes got chit from morning have seen score of make point of never missing exhibition when get chance hate anything understand go with faint hope of being able to find thing out though know perfectly well that will not do so then think be not quite natural doctor say be not natural because know what natural law be say that of thing have seen certainly be not to be accounted for by anything do know be not often that juggler show best trick to white know that a rule be altogether skeptical have seen at native court more than once most astounding thing thing absolutely incomprehensible inexplicable suppose be going to see anything of sort tonight though mr hunter said in note that have heard from native servant that man be famous one there be sect of people in india mean caste sort of secret society who believe claim to be able by sort of influence to suspend altogether law of nature say that believe a scientific man be duty not to believe have seen such thing done by of higher class of juggler under circumstance did not seem to admit of possibility of deception that be obliged to suspend judgment a may imagine dear be exceedingly annoying to of do posse to considerable extent what scotch call second sight be to say power of foreseeing event in future of be morally certain have seen proof of over over again for example once old fakir whom have cured of badly ulcerated limb came up just a be starting on shooting expedition ' go out today said ' foresee evil for saw last night brought back badly wounded 'but if go dream will come wrong said shook head will go in spite of what say ' said 'and will suffer others too looked at group of shikaris who be standing together ready to make start many men be there ' said 'why six of course ' replied see only three ' said 'and three dull spot one of see be holding matchlock on shoulder be examining priming third be sitting down by tire three will come back at end of day other three will not return alive felt rather uncomfortable be a said to myself be good deal younger then dear fool a to be deterred from what promised to be good day sport by such nonsense a went be going after rogue elephant have be doing lot of damage among native plantation found savage brute turned out to be moved just a fired though hit be not on fatal spot charged right down among caught very three men fakir said be doomed dashed life out of then came at bearer have run off with second gun seized flung up in air fell in tree broke three of rib one of arm fortunately though beast tried to get at be out of reach tree be too strong for to knock down then man who be with came up killed got down carried back be week before be about again that be something more than coincidence think there be twenty men out with just four have pointed out be hurt others have seen score of other case in prediction have come true especially in case of disease though grant here prediction often bring about own fulfilment if native be told by fakir holy man that be going to die make struggle to live in several case have seen native whose death have be predicted die without a far a science must tell disease ailment must have be fatal to simply sank died must say from pure fright putting aside class have seen enough to convince that at least among fanatic do posse power of second sight be very extraordinary doctor of course have heard of second sight among certain old people in scotland did not believe in must not have believed in if have not seen same thing here in india naturally have be interested in have read pretty well everything have be written about second sight among highlander of incident be so well authenticated that scarcely see how can be denied of course there be accounting for be possible that among what may call primitive people there be certain intuition instinct call what like have be lost by civilized people power of scent in dog be something so vastly beyond anything can even imagine possible that though put down to instinct be really almost inexplicable take case dog have be known to be taken by railway journey of many hundred mile to have found way home again on foot there be clearly possession of power be to absolutely unaccountable here come uncle will think have be preaching sermon to if look so grave major hannay be too occupied with own thought to notice isobel have anything gone wrong major doctor asked a saw face have just learnt major said that more chupaties be brought last night be most annoying have questioned several of native officer profess to have idea whence came what be meaning of wish must get to bottom of thing keep troop in ferment if must get hold of one of messenger must get out of knew even if have to roast to make tell dear uncle isobel said reprovingly be sure mean what say know said half laughing must certainly consider perfectly justified in taking uncommonly strong step to try to get to bottom of business thing be going on over india must mean something be worse if taken in connection with absurd idea about greased cartridge grant that be act of folly greasing at when know idiotic prejudice native have still must hardly have be foreseen that stir must have be made issue of cartridge have be stopped when native once get idea into mind be next to impossible to disabuse of be tiresome business altogether tiffin ready sahib rumzan interrupted coming out onto veranda be right rumzan now isobel let think of more pleasant subject be to go into hunter evening uncle isobel said a sat down there be going to be famous juggler there there be note for from mr hunter on side table very well dear of fellow be well worth seeing bathurst be coming in to dinner saw a be starting morning just a be going down to line accepted said must be able to get back in time however suppose will mind going round with hope will come doctor to make up table have asked two boy to come in will have to become permanent boarder at establishment major be really useless keeping cook when be in here nearly half time will come be off for three day tomorrow villager came in morning to beg to go out to rid of tiger have established in neighborhood be invitation never refuse if can possibly manage to make time for fortunately everyone be so healthy here at present can be very well spared at dinner subject of juggling came up again two subaltern expressed opinion strongly that be humbug dr wade belief in mr wilson isobel said say so doctor must have thought be last sort of man who must have believed in conjurer requires wise man to believe wilson doctor said fool can scoff wise man question when have be here a long a have if ever get a much sense a have be doubtful may be le positive in idea if can call idea be one for wilson said good humoredly while others laughed well have never seen doctor except fellow who come around to veranda have seen conjurer at home do ever so much better trick than what do think of mr bathurst isobel asked suppose have seen of better sort know what to think of miss hannay used to be rather of wilson opinion have seen thing since must not account for at there be man here two three month back who astounded mr hunter said that girl have have opportunity of seeing good conjurer since came out mr bathurst suppose did know man be speaking of being here be only here for few hour miss hannay have happened to meet before gave private performance be quite different to anything have ever seen though have often heard of feat have performed be so impressed with can assure that for few day have great difficulty in keeping mind upon work what did do mr bathurst bathurst related feat of disappearing girl must have jumped down when be not looking richards said with air conviction possibly bathurst replied quietly a be within three four yard of pole be perfectly distinct in light of lamp a certainly saw till be thirty forty foot up in air see how can have managed for even supposing must have sprung down distance without being hurt must not have come down so noiselessly must not have heard still if did not come down way how must have come wilson said be exactly what ca make out bathurst replied if must happen to be same man will do same thing again fancy will be a much puzzled a be after dinner be over party walked across to mr hunter bungalow where in short time other officer wife other resident at station be assembled chair be placed in veranda for lady number of lamp hung on wall so that strong light be thrown upon ground in front of in addition four post have be driven into ground twenty foot from veranda lamp have be fastened upon know whether juggler will like mr hunter said sha light if object think be quite fair having light behind still if agrees will be hardly possible for to make slightest movement without being seen juggler who be sitting round at other side of house be now called up girl who followed salaamed deeply made even deeper bow to bathurst who be standing behind isobel chair must have paid well bathurst major hannay said have evidently lively remembrance of past favor suppose be same be talking about yes be same people major then said in native dialect to juggler mr hunter have put post with lamp behind rujub have lit because did not know whether must object can be lighted sahib feat depend on darkness of sahib who like to stand behind can do so if come within line of post let go out there wilson said to richards when answer be translated will light lamp will see better there than will see here two went round to other side lit lamp servant stood short distance off on side first trick shown be well known mango tree juggler placed seed in ground poured water upon from lota covered with cloth in two three minute lifted plant four five inch high be seen covered with tall basket first handed round for inspection on removing mango tree three foot high in full bloom be seen be again covered when basket be removed be seen to be covered with ripe fruit eliciting exclamation of astonishment from among spectator who have not before seen trick performed now wilson doctor said perhaps will be kind enough to explain to how be done have more idea than adam doctor then will leave to richards promised at dinner to keep eye well open richards made reply how be done mr bathurst seems almost like miracle be a ignorant a wilson be miss hannay ca account for in way have seen done score of time ah now be going to do basket trick be alarmed when hear girl cry out may be quite sure that be not hurt father be deeply attached to must not hurt hair of head again usual method be adopted basket be placed on ground girl stepped into without pretense of fear usually exhibited by performer before trick began major hannay said to captain doolan come round with to side of boy know first time saw done be nearly throwing on juggler wilson be hot headed boy be likely a not to do so if did man must probably go off in huff show nothing more from what bathurst said be likely to see something unusual a soon a lid be put down apparently angry colloquy took place between juggler girl inside presently man appeared to become enraged snatching up long straight sword from ground ran three four time through basket loud shriek followed first thrust then be silent of lady rose to foot with cry of horror isobel among wilson richards started to rush forward be seized by collar by major captain doolan will open basket juggler said quietly to mr hunter a have seen trick before stepped forward without hesitation opened lid of basket said be empty juggler took up held up bottom upwards what on earth have become of girl wilson exclaimed a spoke passed between richards back to father side well be dashed wilson murmured must not have believed if fifty people have sworn to have seen be too much confounded even to reply when doctor sarcastically said be waiting for explanation gentleman will ask major richards said a wiped forehead with pocket handkerchief to make sure that be solid major translated request girl at once came across richards touched with evident doubt a to whether on not be really flesh blood there be much curiosity among who have seen juggler before a to what must be next feat for generally just seen be closing one of performance a be first seemed that to follow must be extraordinary indeed next feat be one shown to bathurst be performed exactly a upon that occasion except a girl rose beyond circle of light remained distinctly visible sort of phosphoric light playing around in veranda have come out now juggler warning not to approach within six foot of pole higher higher girl went until below judged to be at least hundred fifty foot from ground then light died out disappeared from sight there be silence for minute two then end of pole must be seen descending without minute be reduced to length have be at starting spectator be silent now whole thing be so strange mysterious that have word to express feeling juggler said something mr hunter translated to be request for to resume place be wonderful trick doctor said to bathurst have never seen done way before once saw juggler throw up rope into air how high went know for like be done at night stood up perfectly stiff juggler attendant climbed up went higher higher must hear voice coming down to at last stopped then suddenly rope fell in coil on ground boy walked quietly in just a girl have done now girl now placed in center of open space will please not to speak while trick be being performed juggler said harm might come of watch ground near foot minute later dark object made appearance from ground rose higher higher with undulating movement by jove be python doctor whispered in bathurst ear similar exclamation broke from several of others juggler waved hand with authoritative hush snake rose until head towered above of girl then began to twine round continuously rising from ground until enveloped with five coil thicker than man arm raised head above hers hissed loudly angrily then tail began to descend gradually coil unwound lower lower descended until disappeared altogether be time before anyone spoke so great be feeling of wonder doctor be first to break silence have never seen that before said though have heard of from native rajah must sahib like to see more juggler asked two miss hunter mr rintoul several of others said have seen enough among men there be expressed general wish to see feat must not have missed for anything doctor said must be simple madness to throw away such chance lady therefore with exception of mr hunter mr doolan isobel retired into house must go on one side now juggler said for be only on one side what be now going to do can be seen then proceeded to light fire of charcoal when have done said light must now be extinguished curtain drawn so that light will not stream out from house a soon a be done poured powder over fire by faint light cloud of white smoke must be seen now will show past said who speaks there be silence then dr wade said show past faint light stole up over smoke grew brighter brighter then picture be clearly seen upon be sea house standing by in garden separated from water only by road presently figure of girl appeared at gate stepping out looked down road a if waiting for someone must make out detail of dress see feature distinctly low exclamation broke from doctor then picture gradually faded away future juggler said gradually indian scene appeared on smoke be long straight road bordered by jungle native be seen approaching paused in foreground be doctor mr hunter exclaimed be got up a native be almost at same moment two figure came out from jungle be also in native dress miss hannay doctor said in low tone to bathurst dressed like native dyed one else detected disguise picture again faded away be enough rujub bathurst said for felt isobel lean back heavily against hand held at back of chair felt sure that have fainted draw back curtain someone fancy have be too much for miss curtain be thrown back mr hunter running in brought out lamp doctor have already taken place by isobel side yes have fainted said to bathurst carry in chair a be so that may be in room when come to be done now gentleman doctor said have better light lamp again out here leave lady to get miss hannay round when lamp be lit be evident that whole of men be good deal shaken by what have seen well mr hunter said told be famous juggler that beat anything have seen before have heard of such thing frequently from native be very seldom that european get chance of seeing want to see anything of sort again major hannay said shake one notion of thing in general fancy hunter that will want strong peg round to steady nerve own feel a shaky a boy who think see ghost on way through churchyard there be general murmur of agreement material be quickly brought well wilson what do richards think of major went on after have braced up with strong glass of brandy water must imagine feel little le skeptical than did two hour ago know what richards feel major know feel like fool be sorry bathurst for what said at dinner really did seem to to be possible what told about girl going up into air not coming down again well after have seen have seen evening wo disbelieve anything hear in future about native be natural enough that must be incredulous bathurst said must have be just a skeptical a be when first came out have be astonished now though have seen good juggler before at moment doctor came out again miss hannay be all right again now major be not surprised at fainting old hand a be at matter think have seen a much more juggling than man in india felt very queer specially at snake business a said have seen that ascension trick before how be done have more idea than child smoke scene too be astonishing of course must be accounted for a thrown upon column of white smoke by magic lantern there be certainly no magic lantern here juggler be standing close to girl be sitting at foot watched closely certainly have apparatus about by such view must be thrown on smoke recognized first scene suppose doctor bathurst asked perfectly took back twenty five year be cottage near sidmouth be correct in minute detail figure be that of young lady married four year afterwards many time have seen standing just like that a went along road to meet from little inn at be stopping very pattern of dress need hardly say have never be in mind year be recalled to have be thinking of scene at time must have accounted for somehow upon theory that in way other juggler be conscious of thought reflected upon smoke how at mean to say undoubtedly there exists to extent power of thought reading be mysterious subject one of know absolutely nothing at present maybe in upwards of hundred year mankind will have discovered many secret of nature in direction certainly be not thinking of scene when spoke said 'past have doubt that must show something of past certainly particular incident passed through mind before picture appeared on smoke other be almost a curious doctor captain doolan said for be certainly masquerading a native believe other be bathurst struck so seemed to be running off with native girl what on earth must that mean be use puzzling about doctor said may may not come true have inclination to go about dressed out a native at present there be saying what may come to there be quite enough for to wonder at in other thing mango basket trick have seen dozen time be nearer now than be at first to understanding that ascension trick beat altogether there be something horribly uncanny about snake do think be real snake doctor can not tell richards movement be perfectly natural must see working of rib a wound round girl quivering of tongue a raised head above at other time must be ready to take affidavit that be python of unusual size at present moment must not like to give decided opinion about anything connected with performance suppose be use asking juggler question hunter one of other men said not in least never do answer question higher class of juggler treat art a sort of religious mystery there be instance known of opening lip although large sum have frequently be offered in present case will certainly ask question for man girl have disappeared with box apparatus everything connected with must have slipped off directly last trick be over before have lamp lighted sent after at once servant must find sign of be annoyed because have not paid be not surprised at dr wade said be quite in accordance with what have heard of live by exhibiting what may call ordinary trick have heard from native when show what may call supernatural feat take money be done to oblige powerful rajah a have said be only on very few occasion that european have ever seen well may a well go in to lady fancy of must be inclined to come out onto veranda again evening one be indeed inclined even for talk in very short time party broke up returned home come smoke pipe with bathurst before turn in doctor said a went out think of will be likely to go to sleep for time what be impression of impression certainly be that be entirely unaccountable by law with be acquainted doctor be just idea always have be since first saw really good juggling out here believe in least in anything supernatural can quite believe that there be many natural law of at present be entirely ignorant believe knowledge of at one time existed have be entirely lost at rate among western people belief in magic be a old a anything have knowledge of magician at court of pharaoh threw down rod turned into serpent witch of endor called up spirit of samuel greek by mean nation of fool believed implicitly in oracle coming down to comparatively later time worker of magic burnt book before st paul doe say mind that who pretended to work magic did so who worked magic early traveler in persia india have reported thing saw far surpassing have witnessed evening there be certainly sect in india at present rather body of men a far a have be able to learn of exceptionally intelligent class who believe that posse almost absolute mastery over power of nature see fifty year back if anyone have talked about traveling at fifty mile hour sending message five thousand mile in minute must have be regarded a madman there may yet be other discovery a startling to be made when be in england heard something of set of people in america who called spiritualist of whom notably young man named home claimed to have power of raising through air be far from saying that power exists be of course contrary to what know of law of nature must such power exist must account for disappearance of girl from top of pole highland second sight carried somewhat farther united with power of conveying impression to others must account for picture on smoke be supposing to be true personally own that expect will prove to be true unlikely a may seem that miss hannay will ever be going about in native attire by time have reached doctor bungalow have comfortably seated there be one thing flashed across evening bathurst said told that first evening met miss hannay have distinct knowledge of face laughed at at time certainly seemed absurd be convinced be not wrong now know how be told at dinner today about feat of girl going up not coming down again did not tell for can understand be thing must not care to talk much about that showed picture like saw tonight be house standing in courtyard with high wall round did not particularly observe house be of ordinary native type might for anything know be house in middle of station used a courthouse by hunter for keeping store so on say be that did not notice much there be breach in outside wall round there be fierce fight going on party of officer civilian be repelling assault of body of sepoys on terraced roof of house others be standing firing looking on think engaged in loading rifle be two three woman one of particularly noticed now recall face be that of miss hannay of be absolutely certain be curious lad doctor said after pause picture see have so far come true that have made acquaintance with one of actor whom did not previously know did not believe in truth of doctor believe in now there be one feature in fight be a regret to know impossible what be bathurst bathurst be silent for time be old friend doctor will understand case make more allowance for than most people must when first came out here dare say heard sort of report a to why have left army have afterwards entered civil service there be stupid rumor doctor said that have gone home on sick leave just after battle of chillianwalla have then sold out because have shown white feather need not say that did not give credit to there be always gossip flying about a to reason man leaf army be quite true doctor be hideous thing to say constitutionally be coward can not believe doctor said warmly now that know be last man of whom must credit thing be bane of life bathurst went on be misfortune for will not allow be fault in many thing be not coward think must face danger if danger be silent one can not stand noise report of gun make tremble over even when be blank cartridge be fired when be born father be in india short time before came into world mother have great fright house in country be broken into by burglar who entered room threatened to blow out brain if moved alarm be given men servant came down armed there be struggle in room pistol shot be fired burglar be overpowered captured mother fainted be ill for week afterwards in fact until time be born died few day later never having doctor said recovered from shock have suffered that night grew up weakly timid boy sort of boy be always bullied at school father a know be general officer did not return home until be ten year old be naturally much disappointed in think added to timidity for grew upon rather than otherwise morally be not coward at school can say that never told lie to avoid punishment readiness to speak truth did not add to popularity among other boy used to be called sneak be even more hateful than being called coward a grew up shook off delicacy grew a see into strong man then fought several battle at school learnt to ride came to have confidence in myself though have particular fancy for army father heart be so set on offered objection that sound of gun be abhorrent to knew for first time father put gun in hand fired fainted nothing must persuade to try again still thought that be result of nervousness a to firing must get over in time month two after be gazetted went out to india with regiment arrived just in time to get up by forced march to take part in battle of chillianwalla consequence be that up to time literally have heard musketry practice of event of battle have remembrance from moment first gun be fired to end of day be a one paralyzed saw nothing heard nothing moved mechanically happily will instinct kept in place in regiment when be over silence followed din fell to ground insensible happily for doctor declared be in state of high fever so remained for fortnight a soon a got better be sent down country at once sent in paper went home doubt affair be talked of there be whisper a to real cause of illness father be terribly angry when returned home told truth of matter that son must be coward be naturally awful blow to home be too unhappy to be endured when uncle of mine who be director on company board offered berth in civil service thankfully accepted believing that in capacity need never hear gun fired again will understand then anxiety be feeling owing to rumor of disaffection among sepoys possibility of anything like general mutiny be not of being killed have fear upon contrary have suffered so much in last eight year from consciousness that reason why left army be widely known must welcome death if came to noiselessly thought that if there be trouble will assuredly not be able to play part like man fill with absolute horror now more than ever so will understand now why picture saw in be fighting in middle of sepoys be to not only improbable simply impossible be horrible story to have to tell be first time have opened lip on subject since spoke to father know that a friend doctor will pity rather than blame chapter x a bathurst brought story to conclusion doctor rose placed hand kindly on shoulder certainly must not think of blaming bathurst what tell be indeed terrible misfortune situated a may be soon though trust believe that talk about sepoys be moonshine own be surprised at story for must have said from knowledge of though a must perceive of nervous temperament be likely to be cool collected in danger certainly failing be fault of own be small consolation to doctor men ask why wherefore simply point finger of scorn at coward misfortune be that be here might have lived hundred life in england never once have occasion to face danger thought must have be equally secure a indian civilian now trouble be coming upon why take leave lad have be out seven year now without day relaxation except indeed three day be over with at cawnpore why not apply for year leave have good excuse too did not go home at death of father two year ago must very well plead urgent family affair requiring presence in england will not do doctor will not run away from danger again understand have not least fear of danger in way hold to life think be afraid of physical pain seems to that must undertake desperate service dread simply because know that when din of battle begin body will overmaster mind that will be a be at chillianwalla completely paralyzed wondered tonight why juggler must have exhibited feat seldom almost never shown to european did to please saved daughter life be between ourselves doctor be not to go farther riding in from narkeet heard cry hurrying on came upon man eater shot other day standing over girl with father half beside gesticulating in front of jumped off attacked brute with heavy hunting whip be so completely astonished that turned tail bolted deuce did doctor exclaimed yet talk of being coward say that be coward generally a long a have to confront danger without noise believe must do a well a most men why did mention business with tiger bathurst because in first place be work of mere passing impulse in second because must have gained credit for being what be not brave man will be bad enough when truth becomes known must be worse if have be trading on false reputation therefore particularly charged rujub to say nothing about affair to anyone well putting for time aside bathurst what do think of curious scene miss hannay disguised a native taking with one saw of attack of sepoys upon house look to doctor a if there must be mutiny that mutiny must be attended with partial success that portion of garrison at rate will escape that miss hannay will be traveling down country perhaps to cawnpore in charge while in way will be with perhaps acting a guide may possibly be so doctor agreed be at rate very curious wonder whether miss hannay recognized in disguise must hope not doctor if come true there will be enough for to bear without looking forward to must be glad if detachment be ordered back to cawnpore well must not have thought that bathurst know what mean doctor be for reason wish be gone believe now that insisted on coming down to spend three day with at cawnpore specially might meet be so bathurst like so much that must be very sorry to see throw away upon empty headed fool like greatly be convinced that be just man to make happy a knew that have good prospect in england thought must be capital match for although be young civilian own of late have thought thing be going on very well perhaps might have be so doctor have not be for coming trouble if fear be realized will entirely put end even to possibility of what be talking about will be shown to be coward will do best to put in way of being killed must not like to blow brain out if worst come to worst will do that rather than go on living after have again disgraced look at too seriously bathurst not bit of doctor know if sepoys rise bathurst why must harm officer may be discontented may have grievance against government may refuse to obey order may disband why on earth must attack men who have always be kind to whom have followed in battle against whom have not a much a shadow of complaint hope may be so most sincerely bathurst said one never can say can hardly bring to believe that will attack officer much le injure woman child still have most uneasy foreboding of evil have heard nothing from native a to coming trouble nothing at doctor be convinced that nothing be known among at rate by great bulk of only one person have ever said word to that must indicate knowledge of coming trouble be juggler saw tonight thought nothing of word at time picture showed of attack by sepoys first gave idea that word might mean something since then have heard much more of discontent be convinced now that word have meaning be simple enough be merely assurance two three time repeated that must be ready to repay service have rendered with life might have be mere phrase so thought at time think now have before possibility of event occurring in might be able to repay service have rendered there may have be something in there may not doctor said at rate bathurst ought to be potent ally there doe seem limit to power might for aught one know be able to convey away a did daughter doctor spoke lightly then added seriously man might be of service juggler go among people of class be like troubadour of middle age welcomed everywhere doubt have opportunity of learning what be going on may be that will be able to give timely warning must there be trouble at hand be possible enough bathurst agreed well doctor will be on horseback at six so be time for to turn in taking hat walked across to own bungalow doctor sat for time smoking before turned into bed have a have said heard rumor when bathurst first came out that have shown white feather have paid little attention to at time have be together at first station to bathurst be appointed when came out have come to like greatly evident disinclination to join in society absorption in work certain air of gravity unnatural in young man of twenty have puzzled have at time come to conclusion that must have have unfortunate love affair have got into very serious trouble at home in time that impression have worn off young man speedily recovers from blow however heavy change have taken place in bathurst doctor have in time become so accustomed to manner that have ceased to wonder over now be explained sat thinking over deeply for hour then laid down pipe be terrible pity came out here said of course be not fault in slightest degree one might a well blame man for being born hunchback if there must be row out here will be terrible for can quite understand feeling about if be placed a be be called upon to fight must take dose of prussic acid at once men talk about civilization be little better than savage in instinct courage be almost useless virtue in civilized community if be called for despise man in whom be wanting just a heartily a tattooed ancestor did of course in be purely constitutional failing have doubt must be a brave a lion in other circumstance in fact incident of attacking tiger with dog whip of show that be so yet if must fail when life of woman be at stake must be kindness to give that dose of prussic acid especially a isobel hannay will be here be hardest part of to can see three day later force at deennugghur be increased by arrival of troop of native cavalry under captain forster who have just returned from leave in england do know captain forster doctor isobel hannay asked on afternoon of arrival uncle tell be coming to dinner then must look after heart dear be one of best looking fellow out here dashing soldier devoted servant of fair sex like doctor isobel said quietly have not said so dear far from think said good deal for yes like doctor why be that suppose because be not sort of man doctor said have not seen since regiment ours be at delhi together did not see much of other then taste did not lie in same direction well know what taste be doctor what be will leave to find out dear be told very handsome man with a be perhaps natural very good opinion of distinguished more than once in punjaub by act of personal gallantry have doubt think awful nuisance coming to quiet little station like will probably try to while away time by making very agreeable to think need quite believe that say have long ago got over weakness of believing people flattery doctor however now have forewarned be forearmed doctor hesitated then said gravely be not habit to speak ill of people dear do justice to believe that be sure be not doctor well child in station like must see good deal of man be man who have won many heart thrown away let win yours be not good man have be mixed up in several grave scandal have be ruin of more than one young man at card billiards be in respect dangerous man anatomically suppose have heart morally have not vestige of one do child let make like think there be much fear of doctor after what have said replied with quiet smile be obliged to indeed for warning know be old fool for meddling know dear feel sort of personal relationship to after having be in charge for six month know single man in india whom must not rather see fall in love with than with captain forster thought uncle did not seem particularly pleased when came in to tiffin said there be new arrival must think not doctor said man in notoriously dangerous fellow yet a have never actually outstepped what be considered bound constitute officer gentleman have retained commission have be pretty close shave once twice uncle must know about everyone doe suppose major will open mouth to on subject be one of chivalrous sort of men who never think evil of anyone unless be absolutely obliged to in case like think be wrong at rate have done what consider to be duty in matter now leave in hand be glad to see that be looking quite again have got over fainting fit of other night quite expected to be sent for professionally next morning oh yes have quite got over doctor ca make out how be so silly a to faint never did such thing before be so strange mysterious that felt quite bewildered picture quite frightened know why be first chance have have since of speaking to alone what do think of why must be dressed up a native why must stopped with heightened color on cheek bathurst be dressed up too so noticed own likeness nobody else bathurst recognized two figure came out of wood oh saw too doctor thought might have be mistaken for besides being stained face be obscured somehow uncle mr hunter girl anyone else have spoken to seem to have have idea be though recognized what must mean have not slightest idea in world doctor said very likely meant nothing certainly must not think more about juggler trick be curious unaccountable be use worrying about maybe be going to get up private theatrical day perform indian drama have never taken part in tomfoolery of sort so far there be saying what may come to be going to dine here doctor dear major asked to come in declined told frankly that did not like forster that le saw of better must be pleased other guest turned out to be captain mr doolan mr congreave one of civilian at station doolans

of sort privately dear mind telling that at one time did flirt with have be accustomed to flirt in ireland flirt there mean nothing by have to give up very suddenly must do dear at idea of flirtation differed utterly from mine found be playing with fire be fortunate in getting off without singeing wing be more than good many others must have done must be horrid sort of man isobel said indignantly mr doolan laughed think will find so certainly be not general opinion of woman however will see for in very few minute isobel looked up with curiosity when captain forster be announced at once admitted to herself that doctor report a to personal appearance be fully justified stood over six foot high with powerful frame easy careless bearing hair be cut rather close wore long tawny mustache eye be dark teeth very white perfect momentary look of surprise came across face a eye fell on isobel have hardly expected said a major introduced to to find le than three unmarried lady at deennugghur have pleasure of being introduced to miss hunter afternoon how do do mr doolan think be four year since have pleasure of knowing in delhi believe be number captain forster seems very long time to said thought must say that laughed be quite proper thing to say captain forster have doubt doe seem longer to than doe to a have be home since be here major broke in captain forster will take niece in suppose find very dull after cawnpore miss hannay captain forster asked indeed isobel said like better here everything be sociable pleasant while at cawnpore there be much more formality of course there be lot of dinner party care for large dinner party at be so hot last such time think six be quite large enough then there be general talk everyone can join in just a much a like while at large dinner have to rely entirely upon one person think be very hard work having to talk for hour half to stranger of whom know nothing agree with entirely miss hannay be pretty good hand at talking at time have found very hard work can assure especially when take down stranger to station so that have mutual acquaintance to pull to piece dinner be bright pleasant when evening be over isobel said to uncle think captain forster be very amusing uncle yes major agreed be good talker regular society man be great favorite of mine think will be little too much for in small station like how do mean too much uncle major hesitated well wo have much to do with troop of horse time will hang heavy on hand well there be shooting uncle yes there be shooting think be much in line tiffin call society generally occupy most of time fancy think be fonder of billiards card than be good for others of course being here by a be must do best to be civil to sort of thing if be at cawnpore be man must not care about being intimate in house understand uncle certainly be pleasant oh yes be very pleasant major said dryly in tone seemed to express that forster power of making pleasant be by mean recommendation in eye captain forster have apparently no idea whatever that society must be anything welcome called next day after luncheon have be leaving pasteboard at resident said not very large circle of course knew mr rintoul at delhi a well a mr doolan did not know of others seem pleasant people be very pleasant isobel said left one for man named bathurst be out be that bathurst major hannay who be in line regiment forget number left very suddenly in middle of fighting in punjaub yes believe bathurst be in army about time major said know anything about circumstance of leaving have captain forster known major better must have be aware that what meant to say be that did not wish to know did not detect inflection of voice went on say showed white feather if be same man be at school with unless have improved since then be sure have wish to renew acquaintance like very much major said shortly be great friend with dr wade who have very highest opinion of believe be generally considered to be one of most rising young officer of grade oh have nothing to say against captain forster said be poor creature at school think that there be love lost between did know before came here only met at last race in cawnpore major said be stopping with doctor quite character wade isobel tongue be untied now think be one of kindest best gentleman ever met girl said hotly took care of coming out here one must have be kinder than be have doubt be captain forster said gently still be character miss hannay taking term character to mean person who differs widely from other people believe be very skillful in profession take be sort of abernethy tell most startling truth to patient can quite imagine isobel said doctor hate humbug of sort think must like to call in for imaginary ailment rather put foot in there captain forster said to a sauntered back to tent major did like saying anything against bathurst girl did not like remark about doctor wonder whether objected also to what said about fellow bathurst sneaking little hound be there be doubt about showing white feather in punjaub however think that young lady be of sort to care about coward if asks question a dare say will after what have said will find that story be true one what pretty little thing be did not see prettier face time be at home what with mr doolan time be not likely to hang so heavily here a have expected major afraid that isobel might ask question about story of bathurst leaving army went off hastily a soon a captain forster have left isobel sat impatiently tapping floor with foot awaiting doctor who usually came for hour chat in afternoon well child how did dinner go off yesterday what did think of new visitor saw come away from here hour ago suppose have be calling like at isobel said decidedly well then be exception to general rule thought pleasant enough last night isobel said frankly have deferential sort of way about when speaks to one one can hardly help liking made angry today in first place doctor said be character doctor chuckled well be true enough dear there be harm in then said broke off said what feel sure can not be true said that mr bathurst left army because showed white feather be not true be be sure ca be true doctor did not reply immediately be old story said presently ought not to have be brought up again suppose forster anyone else know right of case when man leaf regiment retires when be upon active service there be sure to be spiteful story getting about often without slightest foundation even if have be true must hardly be to bathurst disadvantage now be no longer in army courage be not vital necessity on part of civilian ca mean doctor surely man ought to be brave must anyone possibly respect man who be coward believe doctor for moment courage dear be not universal endowment be physical a much a moral virtue people be physically brave morally coward others be exactly reverse people be constitutionally coward round while in others cowardice show only partially have known man who be a brave a lion in battle be terrified by rat have known man brave in other respect lose nerve altogether in thunderstorm in of case be man own fault be constitutional by effort must conquer consider bathurst to be exceptionally noble character be sure that be capable of act of great bravery in direction be possible that be like man have spoken of constitutionally weak in others great thing be to be brave in battle doctor must not call man coward simply because be afraid of rat must call man coward who be afraid in battle to be coward there seems to to be coward round have always thought one virtue in man really envied be bravery that coward be most despicable creature living might not be actual fault one ca help that be not anyone fault if be fearfully ugly born idiot for example cowardice seems somehow different not to be brave when be strong seems to put man below level of woman feel sure doctor there must be mistake that story can not be true have seen good deal of mr bathurst since have be here have always spoken so well of be last man must have thought must be must be like know circumstance of case child can trust when say that there be nothing in bathurst conduct that diminishes respect for in slightest degree that in respect be a brave man a know yes doctor may be answer question did mr bathurst leave army because showed cowardice if did know why did invite here why did always praise why did not say 'in other respect man may be good estimable be that most despicable thing coward there be such passion of pain in voice face that doctor only said quietly did not know dear must have told at first in one point be wanting be consider duty of who know thing to speak out be certainly not what say isobel tossed head impatiently need not discus doctor be nothing to whether mr bathurst be brave not only be not quite pleasant to learn that have be getting on friendly term with man who say more doctor broke in might at least remember be friend of mine there be occasion for to quarrel dear to prevent possibility of such thing will be off at once after have left isobel sat down to think over have be said have not directly answered question have not denied that rumor that bathurst have retired from army because be wanting in courage be well founded everything have said in fact be excuse rather than denial doctor be a stanch friend a be bitter opponent must have denied must have done so strongly indignantly be clear that much a liked bathurst believed wanting in physical courage have said indeed that believed be brave in respect have asserted that knew of one exceptional act of courage that have performed what be that if man have have to leave army because be coward to isobel seemed that of thing be most dreadful that man must be wanting in courage tale of daring bravery have always be special delight being full of life spirit have not seemed even possible to that gentleman must be coward that bathurst must be so be to well nigh incredible might a doctor have urged be in way fault did not affect fact might be more to be pitied than to be blamed pity of kind so far from being akin to love be destructive of unconsciously have raised bathurst on lofty pinnacle doctor have spoken very highly of have admired energy with instead of caring a others did for pleasure devoted to work older men than listened to opinion quiet somewhat restrained manner be in contrast to careless fun good humor of most of with whom came in contact have seemed to that be strong man one who must be relied upon implicitly at time have come in few week have be at deennugghur to rely upon opinion to look forward to visit even to acknowledge to herself that approached ideal of what man must be more than anyone else have met now be shattered at blow be wanting in man first attribute have left army if not in disgrace at least under cloud even warm friend doctor must not deny that accusation of cowardice be well founded pain of discovery opened eye to fact have not before even remotely admitted to herself that be beginning to love discovery be bitter one may thank captain forster for at least said to herself a angrily wiped tear from cheek have opened eye in time what must have felt if have found too late that have come to love man who be coward who have left army because be afraid must have despised a much a must despise well that be first lesson will not trust in appearance again why must rather marry man like captain forster even if everything say about be true than man who be coward at least be brave have shown so doctor have gone away in state of extreme irritation confound meddling scoundrel said to a surprised horse with sharp cut of whip just when thing be going on a wished have quite set mind on though be sure bathurst must never have spoken to till have told about unfortunate failing of must have be altogether different coming from own lip just a told to of course lip be sealed must not put case in right light must give three month pay for satisfaction of horsewhipping that fellow forster still ca say did maliciously for must not have known be intimate there that there be anything between question be be to tell bathurst have heard about suppose have better ah here be major drew up horse anything new major look put out yes there be very bad news doctor sowar have just brought letter to from colonel saying that general have got telegram that th native infantry at berhampore have refused to use cartridge served out to yesterday sepoy of th at barrackpore raised seditious cry in front of line when baugh adjutant sergeant major attempted to seize wounded while regiment stood by refused to aid th be to be disbanded doubt th will be too be bad news indeed major look a if talk about general disaffection be true have there be trouble at one station might have be effect of local grievance happening at two place look a if be part of general plot well must hope will go farther be very bad said major at rate may hope will have trouble here regiment have always behaved well be sure have reason to complain of treatment if colonel have fault be that of over leniency with men be so doctor agreed fact be major know really very little about hindoo mind can say with sort of certainty what european will do under given circumstance though know native think pretty nearly a well a most men feel that really know nothing about appear mild submissive have certainly proved faithful on hundred battlefield know whether be real character own history before stepped in altered current show a faithless bloodthirsty cruel whether have changed nature under rule simply disguised heaven only know at rate major said have always shown attached to english officer there be numberless instance where have displayed utmost devotion for although scheming intriguer may have sown seed of discontent among lie about cartridge may have excited religious prejudice may even lead to mutiny can not believe for instant that sepoys will lift hand against officer hope not doctor said gravely tiger cub when tamed be one of prettiest of plaything when once taste blood be a savage beast a mother be before of course hope for best if sepoys once break loose must not answer for anything might do have be pretty well spoilt major till have come to believe that be who conquered india not chapter xi that evening after dining alone doctor went in to bathurst latter have already heard news talked over for time then doctor said have seen forster bathurst since arrived be out when left card be at school with heard when be in england that be out here in native cavalry have never run across before own have wish to do so be about two year older than be be considered cock of school be one of chief tormentor know that be bully generally fellow who be really plucky seldom be disliked heartily hated have habit of telling truth when questioned narrowly escaped expulsion owing to refusing to tell lie about being quietly in bed when in fact two three other fellow have be out at public house never forgave for for must have told lie without hesitation to screen to do justice to screen anyone else mere fact that have be involved in matter having be sent out by one of bigger fellow therefore having got flogging by admission be mitigation in eye of offense of what called sneaking so may imagine have particular desire to meet again unless have greatly changed must do bad turn if have chance think have greatly changed doctor said that be really what came in here for evening rather than to talk about sepoy business be sorry to say bathurst when be in at major today name happened to be mentioned said at once that bathurst who say showed white feather at chillianwalla left army in consequence ' bathurst face grew pale finger closed remained silent minute then said doe not matter must have be sure to hear sooner later must have told myself if have not done so besides if a be afraid berhampore business be beginning of trouble of such trouble a have never have since set foot in india be likely that everyone will know what know now have spoken to about suppose have must not have known that mentioned yes be most indignant about did not believe what did say doctor asked indifferently well be sorry must not tell exactly what told must have be better if must have done so simply said there be many sort of courage be sure that possessed many sort in very high degree must not of course deny although did not admit truth of report have mentioned think make much difference one way other bathurst said wearily have known along isobel hannay must not marry coward only have gone on living in fool paradise however be over now sooner be over better dear fellow doctor said earnestly take thing too much to heart wish to try persuade that be not grave misfortune even suppose trouble take very worst form possible think will come so very badly out of a anticipate even assuming that be unable to do part in absolute fighting there may be other opportunity most likely will in may be able to show that although unable to control nerve in din of battle posse in other respect coolness courage that feat of yours of attacking tiger with dog whip show conclusively that under many circumstance be capable of most daring deed bathurst sat looking down for minute god grant that may be so said at last be use talking about more doctor suppose major hannay will keep sharp lookout over men yes there be meeting of officer afternoon be agreed to make outward change to give troop cause to believe that be suspected feel confident of goodwill of men at same time will watch closely if news come of further trouble will prepare courthouse a place of refuge be very good plan of course everything depends upon whether if troop do rise in mutiny people of oude must join be fighting race if must throw in lot against position must be desperate one well there be doubt doctor said that rajah of bithoor must be with will make cawnpore safe will largely influence great zemindars though there be doubt that good many of have be sulky ever since disarmament order be issued believe there be few of who have not got cannon hidden away buried a for people number of arm given up be a nothing to what know possessed in other part of india believe bulk of people will be with here in oude last annexation fear that will side against unless great landowner range on side a far a can see bathurst said people be contented with change say may call professional fighting class crowd of retainer kept by great landowner who be constantly fighting against other annexation have put stop to town be crowded with fighting men who hate bitterly peasant tiller of soil have benefited greatly be no longer exposed to raid by powerful neighbor can cultivate field in peace quiet unfortunately friendship such a be will not weigh in slightest degree in event of struggle at rate be sure be not behind scene know nothing of coming trouble going a do among talking to a one of must have noticed have there be change in of late naturally have paid special notice to manner well if be to come hope will come soon for anything be better than suspense two day later major hannay read out to men on parade official document assuring that there be truth whatever in statement have be made that cartridge served out to have be greased with pig fat be precisely same a that have used for year men be warned against listening to seditious person who might try to poison mind shake loyalty to government then told that be sorry to say that at one two station men have be foolish enough to listen to disloyal counsel in consequence regiment have be disbanded men have forfeited advantage in way of pay pension have earned by many year of good conduct said that have fear whatever of such trouble arising with a knew that have be well treated that legitimate complaint might make have always be attended to that officer have welfare thoroughly at heart when have finished senior native officer stepped forward in name of detachment assured major that men be perfectly contented must in case follow officer even if ordered to march against countryman at conclusion of speech called upon troop to give three cheer for major officer be responded to with show of great enthusiasm demonstration be deemed very satisfactory uneasiness among resident abated considerably while major officer felt convinced that happened at other station there must at least be trouble at deennugghur well even be satisfied doctor suppose major said a party of who have be dining with dr wade be smoking in veranda be hopeful before major be hopeful now ca say that today parade have influenced in slightest virtue hindoo may have have certainly that of knowing how to wait believe from what took place that have intention of breaking out at present whether be waiting to see what be done at other station until receive signal be more than can say assurance weigh with to slightest extent history be full of case of perfidious massacre must say 'trust a long a can relax watch ' be confirmed croaker captain rintoul said think so rintoul know men be talking about know hindoo generally be mere child can be molded like clay a long a have molding went well if fall into hand of designing men can be led in direction just a easily a have led in own see who can be sufficiently interested in matter to conceive carry out great conspiracy of kind king of oude be captive in hand king of delhi be too old to play part scindia holkar may possibly long for power father possessed be not likely to act together may be regarded a rival rather than friend yet if be not one of who have be brewing storm own see who can be at bottom of unless have really originated from ambitious spirit among sepoys who look in event of success to being master of destiny of india be pity did not get few more view from juggler might have known little more of then talk about doctor wilson said give cold shiver to think of fellow what did have hardly slept since then be most creepy thing ever saw richards have talked over evening have be alone together ca make head tail of affair richards think be girl at who went up on pole sort of balloon in shape then a say there be girl standing among before took place on pole saw sit down settle on cushion so that be balanced right so must not have be balloon then if be balloon afterwards when did change at rate light below be sufficient to see well until be forty fifty foot up after shone out never lost sight of until be ever so high can understand picture because there might have be magic lantern somewhere that girl trick basket trick that great snake be altogether beyond so must imagine wilson doctor said dryly if be must not bother head about nobody have succeeded in finding out of yet wondering in world be not likely to get nearer to be what feel doctor be very riling to see thing that ca account for anyhow wish have sent up richards on pole instead of girl must not have minded going up myself if have asked though expect must have jumped off before got up very far even at risk of breaking neck must not mind risking that doctor said though doubt whether must have known more about when came down juggler always bring girl boy with instead of calling somebody out from audience a do at home well if thing be quiet will organize hunt wilson have heard of tiger fifteen mile away from where killed last richards will go with if like must like of thing doctor provided come off by day think care about sitting through night on tree then not getting anything like fair shot at beast after will go by day doctor said bathurst have promised to get elephant from one of zemindars will have regular party time have half promised miss hannay will have seat in howdah with if major will give leave in case will send out tent make regular party of do say major be perfectly willing doctor have certainly objection to trusting isobel to care know be not likely to miss be not likely to miss certainly besides there will be wilson richards to give coup de grace if finish there be general laugh for two subaltern have be chaffed good deal at missing tiger on previous occasion well when will be major not just at present at rate major said must see how thing be going on certainly must not think of going outside station now must give leave to officer to do so if thing settle down hear more of cartridge business for next ten day fortnight will see about although news of outbreak similar to at barrackpore be received for day report came showed widespread restlessness at various station over india fire believed to be work of incendiary took place there be little abatement of uneasiness become known too that native officer have before rising of berhampore given warning of mutiny have stated that there be widespread plot throughout native regiment to rise kill officer then march to delhi where be to gather story be generally disbelieved although actual rising have shown that to extent report be well founded still men must not bring to believe that troop among whom have lived so long who have fought so well for must meditate such gross treachery without having a far a must be seen real cause for complaint conduct of troop at deennugghur be excellent colonel wrote that at cawnpore there be sign of disaffection that rajah of bithoor have offered to come down at head of own troop must there be symptom of mutiny among sepoys altogether thing looked better feeling of confidence that there must be no serious trouble spread through station weather have set in very hot there be stirring out now for lady between eleven o'clock five six in afternoon isobel however generally went in for chat first thing after early breakfast with mr doolan whose child be fractious with prickly heat only wish have big high mountain dear somewhere within reach where must establish child through summer run away occasionally to look after be very badly off here in oude for be looking very pale last few day suppose feel little isobel said of course anxiety everyone have be feeling worry one everyone seems to agree that there be fear of trouble with sepoys here still a nothing else be talked about one can not help feeling nervous about however a thing seem settling down now hope will soon get something else to talk about have not seen mr bathurst lately mr doolan said presently have isobel said quietly be quite ten day since saw last suppose be falling back into hermit way mr doolan said carelessly shooting keen glance at isobel who be leaning over one of child quite emerged from shell for bit mr hunter be saying never saw such change in man suppose have got tired of captain forster arrived just in time to fill up gap how do like isobel be amusing girl said quietly have never seen anyone quite like before talk in easy pleasant sort of way tell most amusing story then when sits down by one have knack of dropping voice talking in confidential sort of way even when be only about weather be always asking how much of be real what there be under surface mr doolan nodded approval think there be much under surface dear what there be be just a well left alone there be doubt can be delightful when chooses very few woman must not feel flattered by attention of man who be said to be handsomest officer in indian army who have besides distinguished several time a particularly dashing officer think handsomeness go for much in man isobel said shortly mr doolan laughed why must not go for a much a prettiness in woman be use being cynical isobel be part of nature to admire pretty thing a far a can see exceptionally handsome man be a legitimate object of admiration a lovely woman yes to admire mr doolan not to like well dear want to be hurrying away think have better get back before sun get higher may say feel heat much be looking pale fagged le be out in sun better isobel have indeed be having hard time during ten day at first have thought of little what must do when bathurst called seemed impossible that must be exactly same with a have be before be quite out of question yet how be to be different ten day have passed without coming be so unusual that idea came into mind terrified first time when doctor came in found alone said of course dr wade have not mentioned to mr conversation have be curious not having be here since certainly mentioned doctor said calmly how must do otherwise be evident to that must not be welcomed here a be before must not do otherwise than warn of change might expect to find to give reason for isobel stood picture of dismay think have right to do so doctor said have placed in most painful position in not so painful one a must have be dear if have noticed change a must have done asked for cause of isobel stood twisting finger over other before nervously what be to do asked see that there be anything more for to do doctor said mr bathurst may not be perfect in respect be certainly too much of gentleman to force visit where be not wanted say will not come here at for not to do so after being here so much must create comment talk in station must be a painful to a to certainly will not come here more often than be necessary to keep up appearance think ought to have told isobel repeated much distressed must not help dear must force to admit there be truth in story captain forster told be therefore obliged to acquaint with fact must have have just cause to reproach besides spoke of despising man who be not physically brave never told that doctor surely never told that only told what be necessary must know dear namely that have heard story that have questioned that knowing fact from lip admitted that there be foundation for story while asserting be convinced that be morally brave man did not ask how took news did volunteer information on subject understood think perfectly light in must view coward what be to do when meet doctor asked piteously must say that will meet just a ordinary acquaintance do meet miss hannay people be civil to others be thrown with however much may distrust at heart may be sure that mr bathurst will make allusion to matter think can answer for that will see shade of difference in manner have always be heavy burden for a even most careless observer may see in manner say that be not large addition to dare say will pull through now must be off be very unkind doctor never knew unkind before unkind doctor repeated with air of surprise in what way love young fellow have cherished hope for that hardly perhaps ventured to cherish for quite agree with that what have passed have annihilated hope despise man who be coward be not surprised at bathurst be last man in world who must force upon woman who despised have done best to save from being obliged to make personal declaration of sentiment repudiate altogether accusation a being unkind blame in slightest think that view be one young woman of spirit must naturally take acquiesce in entirely will go farther consider most fortunate occurrence for that found out in time isobel cheek have flushed paled several time while be speaking then pressed lip tightly together a finished said think doctor will be just a well not to discus matter further be quite of opinion said will agree not to allude to again goodby then isobel have retired to room cried passionately while doctor have gone off chuckling to a if be perfectly satisfied with state of affair during week have since elapsed major have wondered grumbled several time at bathurst absence expect said one day when note of refusal have come from that doe care about meeting forster remember forster said have be at school together from tone in spoke be evident that disliked other there doubt have heard from doctor that forster be frequently in here major spoke rather irritably for seemed to that isobel showed more pleasure in captain society than must have done after what have said to about indeed isobel especially when doctor be present appeared by mean to object to captain forster attention upon evening however of day when isobel have spoken to mr doolan bathurst came in rather late in evening how be bathurst major said cordially why have become quite stranger have seen for over fortnight do know captain forster be at school together formerly believe bathurst said quietly have not met since fancy be changed beyond recognition captain forster looked with surprise at strong well knit figure have not before seen bathurst have pictured to a weak puny man certainly must not have known mr bathurst said have changed great deal doubt have certainly changed more there be attempt on part of to shake hand a moved apart isobel came into room quick flash of color spread over face when upon entering saw bathurst talking to uncle then advanced shook hand with a usual said be quite time since be here mr bathurst if everyone be a full of business a be must get on badly then moved on without waiting for reply sat down be soon engaged in lively conversation with captain forster whilst bathurst few minute later pleading that a have be in saddle day must go make up for lost time took leave captain forster have noticed flush on isobel cheek when saw bathurst have drawn own conclusion there have be flirtation between said to fancy have put spoke in wheel gave cold shoulder unmistakably april passed a matter seemed to be quieting down there being fresh trouble at of station major told dr wade that really saw reason why projected tiger hunt must not take place doctor at once took matter in hand drove out next morning to village from have received news about tiger have long talk with shikaris of place took general view of country settled line in beat must take place arranged for large body of beater to be on spot at time agreed on bathurst undertook to obtain elephant from two zemindars in neighborhood who promised to furnish six of be more le accustomed to sport while major mr hunter who have be keen sportsman although have of late given up pursuit of large game arranged for number of bullock cart for transport of tent store bathurst declined to be one of party be to consist of mr hunter eldest daughter major isobel doctor two subaltern captain forster captain doolan said frankly that be shot more likely to hit one of party than tiger captain rintoul at first accepted wife shed such flood of tear at idea of leaving going into danger for sake of peace agreed to remain at home wilson richards be greatly excited over prospect talked of nothing else be burning to wipe out disgrace of having missed on previous occasion of interviewed doctor privately implored to put in position where be likely to have first shot used same argument namely that doctor have killed so many tiger one more le must make difference to if missed modestly admitted be possible must still bring animal down a doctor be always in good temper when there be prospect of sport promised of to do that must for at same time pointing out that be always quite lottery way tiger might break out isobel be le excited than must have thought possible over prospect of taking part in tiger hunt have many consultation to hold with mr hunter doctor rumzan a to food to be taken thing must be absolutely necessary for camping out for a be possible that first day beat must be unsuccessful be to be prepared for at least two day absence from home two tent be to be taken one for gentleman other for isobel mary hunter with bedding camp furniture cooking utensil provision be to be sent off at daybreak while party be to start a soon a heat of day be over wish bathurst have be coming major hannay said a with isobel by side drove out of cantonment seems to have slipped away from altogether have only be in once for last three four week have have tiff with about anything have isobel seems strange ceasing so suddenly to come after seeing so much of uncle have not seen except when have what put idea into mind know dear young people do have tiff sometimes about sort of trifle though must not have thought that bathurst be sort of man to do anything of sort think that like forster doe not care to meet fancy be at bottom of very likely isobel said innocently changed subject be dark when reached appointed spot indeed from point where left road native with torch have run ahead to show way tent looked bright two three large fire be burning round lamp have already be lighted within tent do look cozy mary hunter said a isobel entered one prepared for do wish one always lived under canvas during hot weather look cool isobel said suppose be really a cool a bungalow do make comfortable here be bathroom ready be sure want after dusty drive will have one first will must make haste for rumzan said dinner must be ready in hour fortunately sha be expected to do much in way of dressing dinner be cheerful meal everyone be in high spirit tiger have killed cow day before villager be certain that have retired to deep nullah round careful watch have be kept day probably must steal out by night to make meal from carcass of cow have be arranged that be to do undisturbed that hunt be to take place by daylight be wonderful how servant manage everything isobel said table be just a well arranged a be at home people must hardly believe in england if must see sitting here that be only out on two day picnic must be quite content there to rough take meal sitting on ground anyway must get really seems ridiculous having everything like there be nothing like making comfortable doctor said a servant have easy time of generally doe good to bestir now then expense of one two extra bullock cart be nothing make difference in comfort how far be nullah from here doctor wilson who must think of nothing else tiger asked about two mile be just a well not to go nearer not that must be likely to pay visit might take alarm shift quarter more wine major will want blood cool in morning now will go out to look at elephant have talk with mahout find out of animal can be most trusted to stand steady be astonishing what dread most elephant have of tiger be on one once be assured must face anything brute bolted went through tree be swept off pad be hour before opened eye be mercy have not rib broken fortunately be lightweight might have be killed have seen same sort of thing happen dozen time so must choose couple of steady one anyhow for lady for next hour strolled about outside doctor cross questioned mahout told off elephant for party then there be talk with native shikaris arrangement made for beat at early hour retired to rest morning be just breaking when be called twenty minute later assembled to take cup of coffee before starting elephant be arranged in front of tent be just about to mount when horse be heard coming at gallop wait moment major said may be message of sort from station minute later bathurst rode in reined up horse in front of tent why bathurst what brings here changed mind at last moment found must get away be right will come on pad with have not come for major have brought dispatch arrived at two o'clock morning doolan opened came to asked to bring on to a knew way where camp be to be pitched nothing serious hope bathurst major said struck with gravity with bathurst spoke must be something important doolan must never have routed off like that be very serious major bathurst said in low voice may suggest have better go into tent to read of servant understand english come in with major said led way into tent where lamp be still burning on breakfast table although light have broadened out over sky outside be with grave anticipation of evil that major took paper from envelope worst fear be more than verified by content dear major general have just received telegram with terrible news from meerut 'native troop mutinied murdered officer woman child opened jail burned cantonment marched to delhi be reported that there have be general rising there massacre of european although be not confirmed news be considered probable hear also that native cavalry at lucknow have mutinied lawrence telegraph that have suppressed with european troop there have disarmed mutineer believe that regiment will be faithful none can be trusted now must recommend preparing fortified house to european in station can retreat in case of trouble now that have taken to massacre a well a mutiny god know how will all end good heaven who must have dreamt of major groaned massacred officer woman child european at delhi supposed to have be massacred there must be hundred of can be true telegram a to meerut be clearly official one bathurst said delhi be a yet rumor be too probable that if mutineer jail bird flushed with success reached delhi before white be warned must have own way in place a with exception of few artilleryman at arsenal there be not white soldier in place there be white troop at major said what must have be doing however be not question now must of course return instantly ask others to come in here bathurst tell girl have taken place will be time enough for afterwards be necessary to say be that have brought news of trouble at station unaffected before that think best to return at once men be standing in group wondering what news must be be deemed of such importance that bathurst must carry out in middle of night major will be glad if will go in gentleman bathurst said a joined be to go in mr bathurst miss hunter asked think not miss hunter fact be there have be trouble at two three other place major be going to hold sort of council of war a to whether hunt have not better be given up rather fancy that will decide to go back at once news fly very fast in india think major must like that officer must be back before be whispered among sepoys that discontent have not a hoped everywhere ceased must be very serious isobel said uncle must never decide to go back when preparation be made must never do see miss hannay for commandant four of officer to be away if sepoys must take into head to refuse to receive cartridge anything of sort ca give particular then mr bathurst note be very short one be partly made up of unconfirmed rumor a only saw in capacity of messenger think be at liberty to say more than what trouble sepoys be mary hunter said pettishly be too bad losing tiger hunt when may never have chance to see one be very minor trouble mary think so girl said just at present seems to to be very serious at moment doctor put head out of tent will come in bathurst have settled bathurst major said when entered that must of course go back at once doctor however be of opinion that if after preparation be made be to put tiger hunt off altogether must set native talking report must go through country like wildfire that great disaster have happened must go back at once mr hunter having wife daughter there be anxious to get back too doctor urge that must go out kill tiger a be known that have just arrived say that if be willing to go with will be thought that have come here to join hunt if come off tiger be killed doe not matter whether two sixty of went out will be quite willing to do so said bathurst really think that doctor advice be good if now that have arrived upon ground preparation be canceled there can be doubt that native must come to conclusion that something very serious have taken place must be over place in time thank bathurst then will consider arranged now will get horse in a soon a possible be off at once ten minute later buggy be brought round whole party with exception of doctor bathurst started for deennugghur chapter xii let be off at once dr wade said to companion can talk a go along have got two rifle with can lend one will take rifle bathurst said decidedly rather will take one of shikaris gun for sake of appearance for use will borrow one of spear very well will do shooting then doctor agreed two men then took place on elephant most used to work told mahout of others to follow in case elephant must be required for driving tiger out of thick jungle then started side by side for scene of action be awful news bathurst must not have believed possible that fellow who have eaten salt for year fought battle have seemed most docile obedient of soldier must have done that must have be goaded into mutiny by lie about religion being in danger must have imagined well enough that must go in for wholesale massacre not only of officer of woman child seems well nigh incredible have always agreed that if be once roused there be saying what must do think of dreamt of anything a bad a know bathurst said quietly one have watched cloud gathering felt that if did break must be something terrible one can foresee now what will be news that delhi be in hand of mutineer that have massacred european so placed beyond hope of pardon will fly though india like flash of lightning there be guessing how far matter will spread there be use disguising from doctor before week be over there may not be white man left alive in india save garrison of strong place like agra perhaps presidential town where there be always strong european force ca deny that be possible bathurst if revolt spread though three presidency work of conquering india will have to be begun again worse than for must have opposed to vast army drilled armed by ourselves led by native officer have trained seems stupefying that empire won piecemeal after a hard fighting a world have ever seen must be lost in week doctor spoke a if question be purely impersonal one ugly be went on to think have be doctoring up fellow for last thirty year saving life sir by wholesale if have known what have be coming must have dosed with arsenic with a little remorse a must feel in shooting tiger whelp well there be one satisfaction major have already done something towards turning courthouse into fortress fancy good many of scoundrel will go down before take be if fall on unawares have be noncombatant life if can shoot tiger on spring fancy can hit sepoy by jove bathurst that juggler picture told of be likely to come true after wish to heaven be bathurst said gloomily must look without dread at be coming a far a be concerned if must believe possible must be fighting a saw there pooh nonsense lad doctor said knowing what know of have doubt that though may feel nervous at first will get over in time bathurst shook head know too well doctor to indulge in such hope now see be going out tiger hunting at present now a far a be concerned must feel much le nervous if knew be going to enter jungle on foot with only spear than do at thought that be going to fire rifle few pace from will scarcely notice in excitement doctor said in cold blood admit might feel think will when see tiger spring out from jungle at here be be nullah in say tiger retires at night expect beater be lying round in readiness a soon a have taken up station at mouth will begin shikari came up a approached spot tiger went out last night sahib finished cow came back before daylight beater be in readiness to begin elephant be soon in position at mouth of ravine be thirty yard across at about same distance in front of jungle of high coarse grass thick bush began if be going to shoot bathurst must take post one side a be not going to will place nearly in center if be between rock tiger be pretty certain to go on other side a will seem most open to now be ready said to shikari latter waved white rag on top of long stick at signal tremendous hubbub of gong tom tom mingled with shout of number of men arose doctor looked across at companion face be white set muscle twitched convulsively be looking straight in front of teeth set hard interesting case doctor muttered to if have be anyone else than bathurst expect tiger will be little time before be down bathurst said in quiet voice three time repeated observation time raising voice higher before bathurst heard sooner come better bathurst said between teeth must rather face hundred tiger than infernal din quarter of hour passed doctor rifle in hand be watching bush in front when saw slight movement among leaf on right side on bathurst be stationed that be bathurst have headed back caught sight of elephant mine will make bolt in minute now unless turn back on beater minute later there be gleam of tawny yellow among long grass quick a thought doctor fired with sharp snarl tiger leaped out with two short bound sprang onto head of elephant ridden by bathurst mahout gave cry of pain for talon of one of forepaw be fixed in leg bathurst leaned forward thrust spear held deep into animal neck at same moment doctor fired again tiger shot through head fell dead while with start bathurst lost balance fell over elephant head onto body of tiger be fortunate indeed for that ball have passed through tiger skull from ear to ear that life be extinct before touched ground bathurst sprang to foot shaken bewildered otherwise unhurt be a dead a door nail doctor shouted lucky for be so if have have kick left in must have be badly torn must never have fallen off bathurst said angrily if have not fired must have finished with spear might might not must not wait to think about tiger have struck claw into mahout leg must have have off elephant in moment be first rate animal be riding on must have turned bolted if have done so mahout must have be off to certainty by time shout of native who have taken post in tree near at hand told beater that shot have heard have be successful with shout of satisfaction came rushing down doctor at once dispatched one of to bring up trap bathurst horse then examined tiger be very large one skin be in good condition showed that have not taken to man eating long doctor bound up wound on mahout leg then superintended skinning of animal while waiting for arrival of trap when came up said might a well take seat by side bathurst syce will sit behind lead horse having distributed money among beater doctor took place in trap tiger skin be rolled up placed under seat bathurst mounted beside started there see doctor bathurst who have not opened lip from time have remonstrated with doctor for firing said see be of use be not afraid of tiger for knew that be not likely to miss that in case must not reach on elephant can declare have not shadow of fear of beast yet directly that row began nerve gave way altogether be hideous yet moment tiger charged felt perfectly cool again for row ceased a fired first shot struck full in chest be about to thrust spear right down must believe have killed if have not fired again startled so fell from elephant saw that shouting noise unnerved bathurst saw too that be perfectly cool steady when planted spear into if have not got hold of mahout leg must not have fired be there nothing to be done doctor know now what be likely will have to face with sepoys what will be with if rise be there nothing can do for doctor shook head believe in dutch courage in case bathurst certainly not in yours there be saying what effect of spirit might be must not recommend lad of course can understand feeling still believe that even if do badly to begin with will pull round in end have doubt will get chance to show that be only nerve not courage in be deficient bathurst be silent scarce word be spoken during drive back to deennugghur place have accustomed appearance when drove up doctor a drew up before bungalow said thank god have not begun yet be half afraid might have found have taken advantage of most of being away have broken out before got back so be bathurst said have be thinking of nothing else since started well will go to major at once see what arrangement have be made whether there be further news will go off on round bathurst said have arranged yesterday to be at nilpore morning there will be time for to get there now be only eleven o'clock yet will go about work a usual until matter come to head doctor found that major be over at tent served a orderly office at once followed there nothing fresh major found everything going on a usual have be decided to put courthouse a far a can in state of defense will have spare ammunition quietly taken over there with store of provision lady have undertaken to sew up sacking make gunny bag for holding earth of course will get store of water there everything will be done quietly at present thing will be sent in there after dark by such servant a can thoroughly rely upon at first sign of trouble resident will make straight for point of course must be guided by circumstance if trouble begin in daytime be if doe begin for native officer assure that can trust implicitly in loyalty of men there will probably be time for everyone to gain courthouse if be at night without warning a be at meerut can only say doctor may god help for fear that few if of must get there alive certainly not enough to make efficient defense see that there be anything else to do major trust with that men will prove faithful if not be black lookout whichever way take did kill tiger doctor yes at least bathurst did between wounded first then sprang upon bathurst elephant speared finished with shot through head speared major repeated why did shoot be doing with spear be born major with constitutional horror of firearm inherited from mother will tell about day in fact can not stand noise of sort have be source of great trouble to young fellow who in other respect have more than fair share of courage however will talk about when have more time on hand there be special duty can give at present yes there be be in respect most disengaged man in station can come go without attracting attention propose therefore that will take charge of arrangement of matter in courthouse think that will be advantage if move from tent in there at once there be plenty of room for one can say at what time there may be trouble with sepoys must be great advantage to have someone in courthouse who must take lead if woman with servant so on come flocking in while be still absent on parade ground besides with rifle must drive small party off who attempted to seize by surprise if be there must call hospital must be excuse for sending in store bedding so on might mention in orderly room that be getting so hot now that think must be a well to have room two fitted up under roof instead of having sick in tent in case there must be outbreak of cholera anything of sort year will say that think idea be very good one that a courthouse be very little used have better establish there native officer who hear what say will spread news say will be believed at least will serve a explanation yes think that will be very good plan major two of men who act a hospital orderly can certainly depend upon will help to receive thing sent in from bungalow will hold tongue a to what be being done will leave tent standing use occasionally a before will make courthouse headquarters how be off for arm there be five case of musket considerable stock of ammunition in small magazine in line one of first thing will be to get removed to courthouse have already arranged to do tonight will give four five musket apiece good major will load keep locked up in room upstairs facing gateway must there be trouble fancy must give good account of small body of men who might attempt to make entrance be very well content with position a commandant of hospital a may call house have not be much good to hitherto suppose when be bought be intended to make more important station be fortunate did buy now for can certainly turn into small fortress still of course can not disguise from that though might get on successfully for time against sepoys there be hope of holding long if whole country rise quite see that doctor major said gravely have really fear of with assistance of rajah of bithoor cawnpore be safe example be almost certain to be followed by almost other great landowner be quite bad enough that have to face sepoy mutiny can not believe that be likely to have general rising on hand if do stopped if do be up with major there be disguising that however need not look at worst side of thing well will go with to orderly room will talk with about hospital scheme mention that there be rumor of cholera so on ask if ca have part of courthouse then can walk across there together see what arrangement have best be made following day brought dispatch from colonel saying that rumor a to delhi be confirmed regiment there have joined meerut mutineer have shot down officer murdered european must lay hand on three officer six noncommissioned officer who be in charge of arsenal have defended desperately have finally blown up magazine with hundred of assailant three of defender have reached meerut with news day by day gloom thickened native regiment in punjaub rose a soon a news from meerut delhi reached there be white troop there be used energetically promptly in place mutineer be disarmed before broke out into open violence in other case mutinous regiment be promptly attacked scattered several of leading chief have hastened to assure government of fidelity have placed troop resource at disposal in punjaub alone lookout appeared favorable in daob mutiny have taken place at four of station sepoys have marched away to delhi without injuring european after for week there be quiet then at place widely apart at hansid hissar to northwest of delhi at nusserabad in center of rajpootana at bareilly other station in rohilcund sepoys rose in most place massacre be added to

soon a meeting be complete mr hunter read aloud one of psalm suited to position prayer for in danger then work be got out needle applied briskly even mr rintoul showed fortitude courage must not have be expected from one never know people mr doolan said to isobel a walked back from one of meeting a long a one only see under ordinary circumstance have never have patience with mr rintoul with constant complaining imaginary ailment now that there be really something to complain about be positively one of calmest most cheerful among be curious be not how talk always turn upon home india be hardly ever mentioned might be party of intimate friend sitting in quiet country place talking of girlhood why have learnt more of other other history in last fortnight than must have done if have lived here together for twenty year under ordinary circumstance except a to little brother think be only one isobel who have not talked much of home suppose be because home be not very happy one isobel said notice that talk be about happy scene nothing be ever said about disagreeables suppose dear be just a have heard that starving people talk about feast have eaten so talk of pleasant time have have be contrast make dearer be funny too if anything can be funny in day how different be in evening when have men with to what be when be together alone in day curious thing be that trouble seems to make more like other of course be not more like somehow take same tone seem to have given up own particular way fancy now men seem like mr hunter for example whom used to think even tempered easygoing sort of man have become fidgety querulous major be even more genial kind than usual doctor snap snarl at everyone everything anyone listening to husband must say that be in wildest spirit rintoul be quieter than usual two lad have grown older nicer say be le full of fun than be especially wilson be le boyish in fun be nice with everyone instead of devoting to two three of principally perhaps richards be most changed think le of collar tie polish of boot than used to do one see that have idea in head besides about horse captain forster be perhaps least changed of that can judge better than can for see more of a to mr bathurst can say nothing for never see now think be only man in station who go about work a usual start away first thing in morning come back late in evening suppose spends night in writing report though what be use of writing report at present time know mr hunter be saying last night be very foolish of what with disbanded soldier what with party of mutineer be most dangerous for european to stir outside station uncle be saying same isobel said quietly well here separate of course will be in a usual evening for major house be general rendezvous after dinner isobel have private trouble although a often said angrily to herself when thought of did matter now be discontented with for having spoken a strongly a did a to man cowardice be very discontented with doctor for having repeated be angry with bathurst for staying away altogether although willing to admit that after knew what have said be impossible that must meet a before most of perhaps be angry because at time when life be in deadly peril must allow matter to dwell in mind single moment late one afternoon bathurst walked into major bungalow just a be about to sit down to dinner major want to speak to for moment said sit down have dinner bathurst have become altogether stranger thank major have great deal to do can spare five minute now be of importance isobel rose to leave room there be reason must not hear miss hannay must be better that none of servant must be present be why wish to speak before uncle go in to dinner isobel sat down with air of indifference for last week major have ridden day five twenty to thirty mile in direction of cawnpore official work have be practically at end since heard news from meerut must be of use here thought must do better service than trying to obtain earliest news from cawnpore be sorry to say that afternoon distinctly heard firing in direction what result be of course know feel that there be little doubt that trouble have begun there be not on return home ten minute ago found letter on dressing table have direction be a see in hindustanee handed to major who read to sahib bathurst rising at cawnpore today nana sahib troop will join sepoys white will be destroyed rising at deennugghur at daylight tomorrow troop after killing white will join at cawnpore be warned in time tiger be not to be beaten off with whip good heaven major exclaimed can be true can be possible that rajah of bithoor be going to join mutineer be impossible must never be such scoundrel what be uncle isobel asked leaving seat coming up to major translated letter must be hoax went on can not believe doe stuff about beating tiger with whip mean be sorry to say major hannay that part of letter convinces that content can be implicitly relied upon writer did not dare sign name word be sufficient to show be doubt intended to show who warning come from be from that juggler who performed here six week ago traveling about a doe putting aside altogether strange power of have doubt mean of knowing what be going on a told that night have done slight service promised at time that if occasion must ever arise must risk life to save mine fact that showed have doubt especially to please feat that few european have seen before be to mind proof of goodwill that meant what said how do know that be from bathurst will excuse pressing question of course everything depends on being assured that communication be trustworthy allusion to tiger show that major alludes to incident believe to be known only to daughter to dr wade to whom alone mentioned a major still looked inquiringly bathurst went on reluctantly be trifling affair major result of passing impulse be riding home from narkeet while coming along road through jungle be at time almost deserted by native on account of ravage of man eater whom doctor afterwards shot heard scream galloping forward came upon brute standing with one paw upon prostrate girl while man juggler be standing frantically waving arm on impulse of moment sprang from horse lashed tiger across head with heavy dog whip carry brute be so astonished that bolted in jungle be beginning end of affair except although fortunately girl be practically unhurt be so unnerved that have to carry to next village where lay for time ill from shock fright after came round here performed for amusement feat told of so see have reason to believe in good faith of writer of letter by jove must think have major said why dear bathurst have idea that must do thing have strong point weak one major be one of strong one suppose now what have best be done sir be important question at present be so evident that major hannay at once dismissed other thought from mind of course other officer must remain at post until sepoys actually arrive question be a to others now that know worst believe know ought to send woman child away be question sir where can be sent lucknow be besieged white at cawnpore must have be surrounded by time band of mutineer be ranging whole country at news that nana sahib have joined rebel be probable that will rise must say that be matter in mr hunter other civilian have better be consulted yes will hold council major said think major must be done quietly be probable that many of servant may know of intention of sepoys if see that anything like council of european be being held may take news to sepoys latter thinking that intention be known may rise at once be quite true yes must hing to arouse suspicion what do propose mr bathurst will go have talk with doctor can go round to other officer one by one will tell mr hunter will tell other resident so when meet here in evening explanation will be needed very few word a sit out on veranda will be sufficient will be very good plan will sit down to dinner a if nothing have happened if be watching at will be keeping eye on then very well will be in by nine o'clock major with slight bow to isobel bathurst stepped out through open window made way to doctor chapter xiii doctor have just sat down to dinner when bathurst came in two subaltern be dining with be good bathurst doctor said a entered boy put chair for mr bathurst have begun to think that have deserted a well a everybody else be not thinking of dining bathurst said a sat down will do so with pleasure though told man must be back in hour a servant left room added have much to say doctor get through dinner a quickly a can get servant out of tent conversation be at once turned by doctor upon shooting hunting allusion be made to passing event until coffee be put on table servant retired talk have be lively during dinner then ceased well bathurst doctor asked suppose have something serious to tell very serious doctor repeated news have given major must not be worse doctor said quietly after first shock of news have passed know never have faith in sepoys since saw how madness be spreading from station to station sort of thing be contagious becomes sort of epidemic in spite of assurance of men felt sure must go scoundrel of bithoor turning against be more than bargained for there be disguising fact that mean general rising through oude in case god help woman child a for come in line of business doe major say only question seemed to to be open be whether woman child must be got away there doe not seem possible place for to go to one two might travel down country in disguise be out of question for large party there be refuge nearer than allahabad with man hand against see not slightest chance of party making way down might do easily enough doctor for woman seems to out of question still be matter for married man to decide for prospect be dark enough anyway a before seems to that everything really depends upon zemindars if hold courthouse be possible sepoys may be beaten off in first attack in impatience to join mutineer who be apparently marching for delhi may go off without throwing away life by attacking for must see will not be able to take place without cannon if zemindars join with cannon may defend till last there can be one end to doctor nodded be situation exactly bathurst be glad know danger will be able to face openly wilson said for last month richards have be keeping watch alternately have be beastly funky work sitting with one pistol on table before one listening knowing moment there might be yell brown devil come pouring in now at least be likely to have fight for to know of will go down before do richards cordially agreed with companion well now what be order bathurst said doctor there be order a yet doctor major say will go round to others doolan rintoul forster tell be to go round to hunter other civilian then evening be to meet at nine o'clock a usual at major if others decide that only plan be for to stop here fight out there will be occasion for anything like council will only have to be arranged at what time move into fort best mean for keeping news from spreading to sepoys not that will make much difference after have once fairly turned in if there be one thing hindoo hate more than be getting from under blanket when have once got warm at night even if heard at one two o'clock in morning that be moving into fort think must turn out till morning be sure must not doctor agreed if there be few more of richards said must vote for beginning if be to fall suddenly upon might kill lot scare rest off be too few for that doctor said besides although bathurst answer for good faith of sender of warning there have a yet be act of mutiny must justify taking such step a that must come to same thing might kill good many in long run three hundred men must be more than match for dozen then woman must be at mercy well have better be moving will not have time to go round to bungalow before people set out for major be painful mission that bathurst have to perform for have to tell called upon that almost certain death be at hand news be everywhere received calmly strain have of late be so great that news that crisis be at hand be almost welcome did not stay long anywhere after setting alternative before left husband wife to discus whether to try to make down to allahabad to take refuge in fort soon after nine o'clock be at major hannay there be pale face among stranger must have supposed that whole party have just received news be virtually death warrant lady talked together a usual while men moved in out of room sometimes talking with major sometimes sitting down for few minute in veranda outside talking there in low tone together major moved about among soon learned that have resolved to stay meet together came preferring that to hardship unknown danger of flight be glad have decided so said quietly in state country be chance of getting to allahabad be next to nothing here may hold out till lawrence restores order at lucknow then may be able to send party to bring in mutineer may draw off march to delhi certainly think chance be best here besides rifle have be of importance though if of have made up mind to try escape must have made objection be glad that will stand together here arrangement be then briefly made for removal to courthouse be to go back apparently to retire to bed a usual at twelve o'clock men armed be to call up servant load up with such thing a be most required proceed with woman child at once to courthouse men be to remain there on guard while others must continue with servant to make journey backwards forward to bungalow bringing in a much a must be carried guard to be changed hour in morning servant be to have choice given of remaining with master leaving captain forster be only dissentient be in favor of whole party mounting placing woman child in carriage making off in body fighting way if necessary down to allahabad admitted that in addition to hundred trooper of own squadron might be cut off by mutinous cavalry from cawnpore fall in with body of rebel be attacked by villager maintained that there be at least chance of cutting way through while once shut up in courthouse escape must be well nigh impossible all along agreed to holding courthouse forster major said yes then reckoned upon cawnpore holding out with assistance of nana sahib upon country remaining quiet now whole thing be changed be quite ready to fight in open to take chance of being killed there protest against being shut up like rat in hole to rest however proposal appeared desperate there must be no withstanding single charge of well trained trooper especially a must be necessary to guard vehicle have not be for that small body of men might possibly have cut way through cavalry even then must be so hotly pursued that most of must assuredly be hunted down encumbered by woman such enterprise seemed utterly hopeless whole of others be unanimously against party broke up very early strain of maintaining ordinary demeanor be too great to be long endured lady with child be anxious to return a soon a possible to lest at last moment sepoys must have made change in arrangement by ten o'clock whole party have left two subaltern have preparation to make have already sent most of

there be someone else want service more than do yes be anyone else hit know that anyone else be hit doctor a turned to come into house after gate be shut there be that fellow bathurst leaning against wall a white a sheet shaking over like leaf must say strong dose of dutch courage must be best medicine there do justice to bathurst captain forster doctor said gravely be man esteem most highly in respect be bravest man know be constitutionally unable to stand noise sound of gun be torture to be unfortunate idiosyncrasy for be in way accountable exceedingly unfortunate must say forster said with dry laugh especially at time like be rather unlucky for fighting be generally accompanied by noise if have idiosyncrasy a call must blow out brain perhaps bathurst must do so too captain forster if have not more brain to blow out than people have be sharp doctor forster laughed good temperedly mind fair hit well must go doctor said somewhat mollified there be plenty to do expect after fellow have held council of war will be trying attack when doctor went out found whole of garrison busy major have placed four men on roof have ordered everyone else to fill bag have be prepared for purpose with earth from garden be only order to men male servant lady have gone out to render assistance a fast a native filled bag with earth lady sewed up mouth of bag men carried away piled against gate garrison consisted of six military officer doctor seven civilian ten lady eight child thirty eight male servant six female work therefore went on rapidly in course of two hour so large pile of bag be built up against gate that there be probability whatever of being forced now major said want four dozen bag at least for parapet of terrace need not raise must build up breastwork two bag high at of angle there be only just time to accomplish when one of watch on roof reported that sepoys be firing bungalow a soon a saw that european have gained shelter of courthouse sepoys with yell of triumph have made for house of european disappointment at finding that not only have white taken refuge in courthouse that have removed most of property vented in setting fire to building after stripping of everything then amused by keeping up straggling fire against courthouse a soon a bag be taken onto roof defender keeping a much a possible under shelter of parapet carried to corner of terrace piled two deep thus forming breastwork four foot high eight of best shot be then chosen two of took post at corner now doctor said cheerfully a sat behind small loophole have be left between bag be turn fancy will waste a much lead a have be doing fire from defender be slow be deadly in very short time sepoys no longer dared to show in open took refuge behind tree whence endeavored to reply to fire on roof even proved so dangerous that be not long before fire ceased altogether drew off under cover of smoke from burning bungalow isobel hannay have met bathurst a be carrying sack of earth to roof have be wanting to speak to mr bathurst ever since yesterday evening have never given opportunity will step into storeroom for few minute a come down a came down went to door of room in isobel be standing awaiting be not coming in miss hannay believe know what be going to say saw in face last night when have to tell that tiger story want to say that be sorry said that despised coward say be perfectly right can not despise one tenth a much a despise while be looking at mutineer from roof be leaning against wall below well nigh fainting what do think feeling must be that here where man be brave where there be woman child to be defended alone can not bear part look at face know there be not vestige of color in look at hand be not steady yet be useless for to speak may pity can not despise believe that death when come will be to happy release indeed from shame misery feel then turning left girl without word went about work doctor have just before going up to take place on roof come across come in here dear bathurst said seizing arm dragging into room have be given up to for drug surgical appliance let give strong dose of ammonia ginger want pickup can see by face want doctor will not take bathurst said be one thing have made up mind to will take spirit to create courage posse be not courage have nothing to do with courage doctor said angrily be simple question of nerve a have told over over again call what like doctor result be precisely same mind taking strong dose of quinine if will give for feel a weak a child spirit with impatient shrug of shoulder doctor mixed strong dose of quinine gave to hour later sudden outburst of musketry took place not native showed on side of house facing maidan from garden on other three side heavy fire be opened man to roof major said four men to of rear corner three to others do think be fit to fire forster have not better keep quiet for today will have opportunity enough be all right major said carelessly can put rifle through loophole fire though have one arm in sling by jove broke off suddenly look at fellow bathurst look like ghost roll of musketry be unabated defender be already beginning to answer bullet sung thickly overhead above din must be heard shout of native bathurst face be rigid ghastly pale major hurried to dear bathurst said think have better go below will find plenty of work to do there work be here bathurst said a if speaking to must be done major must not at moment pay further attention to for roar of fire broke out round inclosure a from ruined bungalow from bush sepoys who have crept up now commenced attack in earnest while defender lying behind parapet replied slowly steadily aiming at puff of smoke a darted out attention be suddenly called by shout from doctor be mad bathurst lie down man throwing away life turning round major saw bathurst standing up right by parapet facing point where enemy fire be hottest held rifle in hand did not attempt to fire figure swayed slightly to fro lie down major shouted lie down sir then a bathurst still stood unmoved be about to run forward when doctor from one side captain forster from other rushed towards through storm of bullet seized in arm dragged back to center of terrace nobly done gentleman major said a laid bathurst down be almost miraculous not being hit bathurst have struggled fiercely for moment then resistance have suddenly ceased have be dragged back like wooden figure eye be closed now have be hit doctor major asked seems impossible can have escaped what madness possessed to put there a target think be hit doctor said a examined think have fainted have better carry down to room shake hand forster know bathurst be not good friend risked life to save did not think who be forster said with careless laugh saw man behaving like madman naturally went to pull down however will think better of in future though doubt whether be in right sens wanted to be killed doctor said quietly effort that made to place in way of death must have be greater than can well understand forster know circumstance of case morally believe there be braver man living than be physically have constitution of timid woman be mind against body distinction be too fine for doctor forster said a turned to go off to post by parapet understand pluck understand cowardice mysterious mixture speak of be beyond altogether major dr wade lifted bathurst carried below mr hunter who have be appointed chief nurse met be badly wounded doctor be not wounded at mr hunter stood up at edge of parapet exposed so rashly to sepoys fire that have to drag away then reaction acting on nervous temperament be too much for fainted will soon bring round can come in with keep others away major at once returned to terrace in spite of restorative doctor poured through lip cold water dashed in face bathurst be time before opened eye seeing mr hunter doctor beside made effort to rise must lie still bathurst doctor said pressing hand on shoulder have done very foolish thing very wrong thing have tried to throw away life did not have thought of throwing away life bathurst said after pause be trying to make stand fire did not think whether must be hit not be not afraid of bullet doctor be horrible fiendish noise can not stand know boy doctor said kindly come to same thing did put in way of bullet when doing so be of possible advantage be almost miracle that escaped unhurt must remain here quiet for present ii will leave in charge of mr hunter there be nothing for to do on roof at present attack be mere outbreak of rage on part of sepoys that have escaped know well enough ca take house by merely firing away at roof when attack in earnest will be quite time for to take part in affair again now mr hunter order be absolute that be not to be allowed to get up on doctor leaving room found several of lady outside news that mr bathurst have be carried down have spread among be badly hurt doctor lady mr bathurst be unfortunately for extremely nervous man noise of firearm have effect upon that can not by effort of own overcome in order a say to try accustom to went stood at edge of parapet in full sight of sepoys let blaze away at must have be killed if forster have not dragged away by main force then came natural reaction fainted be there be about poor fellow be extremely sensitive on ground of personal courage in other respect have known do thing requiring amount of pluck that not one man in hundred posse wish to remember that nervousness at effect of noise of firearm be purely constitutional weakness for be in way to be blamed have just risked life in most reckless manner in order to overcome what considers what know that person consider be cowardice must be a cruel may say a contemptible to despise for constitutional failing a must be to despise person for being born humpback cripple can not stand talking longer will be of more use on roof than be here isobel hannay be not among who have gathered near door of room in bathurst be lying doctor have raised voice heard what said bent over work of sewing strip of linen together for bandage with paler face than have be caused by outbreak of musketry gradually firing ceased sepoys have suffered heavily from steady fire of invisible defender gradually drew off in hour from commencement of attack be silent round building so far so good lady major said cheerily a garrison leaving one man on watch descended from roof have have casualty think must have inflicted good many mutineer be not likely to try game on again for must see that be wasting ammunition be doing harm now hope servant have got tiffin ready for for be sure have excellent appetite tiffin be quite ready major mr doolan who have be appointed chief of commissariat department said cheerfully servant be little disorganized when firing began soon became accustomed to think will find everything in order in hall meal be really cheerful one fact that first attack have passed over without anyone being hit raised spirit of woman be disposed to look at matter in cheerful light two young subaltern be in high spirit party be more lively than have be since first outbreak of mutiny have felt severely strain of waiting reality of danger be positive relief after continuous suspense be much to to know that crisis have come at last that be still together foe be without be difficult to believe mr doolan said that be only yesterday evening be gathered at major seems age since then yes indeed mr rintoul agreed night seemed endless worst time be waiting till be to begin to move over after did not so much mind though seemed more like week than night while thing be being brought in here think worse time be while be waiting watching from roof to see whether troop must come out on parade a usual isobel said when uncle others be in captain forster gate be shut seemed that anxiety be over be mad charge of yours forster major said be like balaclava business magnificent be war did not think of one way other captain forster laughed be so furious at insolence off dog attacking that thought of nothing else just went at of course be foolish did good doctor said showed sepoys how little thought of how single white officer be ready to match against squadron will render good deal more careful in attack than otherwise must have be brought under fire too suffered pretty heavily be sure infantry must have lost good many men from fire just now hope will come to conclusion that wisest thing can do be to march away to delhi leave severely alone now what be order major for after breakfast think best thing be for everyone to lie down for few hour major said one have wink of sleep last night most of have not slept much for night past must always keep two men on roof to be relieved two hour will draw up regular rota for duty except two rest have better take good sleep may be called upon to be under arm at night will go on first relief major doctor said feel particularly wide awake be nothing new to to be up night put bathurst down with said in low tone a major rose from table know that understand will be le painful for to be with than with anyone else will go up at once send young harper down to breakfast there will be occasion to have bathurst up time sepoys be not likely to be trying prank at present doubt have gone back to line to get meal doctor have not be long at post when isobel hannay came up onto terrace have seen other alone comparatively little of late a doctor have given up habit of dropping in for chat in morning since conversation about bathurst well dear what be asked be place for for there be few fellow still lurking among tree send shot over house occasionally came up to say that be sorry doctor be right isobel always say be sorry when be so although in nine case out of ten be one of saying so be too late to do much good think be rather hard upon doctor know be speaking at today when be talking to others especially in what said at end perhaps be think quite deserved yes know did be hard to tell be a contemptible to despise man for physical weakness must not help a to despise one for being born humpbacked cripple when know that brother be so wanted to feel that conduct have be contemptible isobel put in way be most likely to come home to have be disappointed in thought be more sensible than run of young woman found out that be not thought have confidence in judgment turned out that have not if bathurst have be killed when be standing up target for sepoys must have held morally responsible for death must have shared responsibility anyhow doctor for be who repeated word to will not go over ground again said doctor quietly gave reason for doing so reason be to mind convincing now will tell how constitutional nervousness on part arose told story a at time there have be occasion for to show whether be brave otherwise considered lip sealed now that weakness have be exhibited consider more than justified in explaining origin then repeated story bathurst have told see said when have finished be constitutional matter beyond control be sort of antipathy have known case of woman courageous in other respect who at sight of even dead cockroach must faint away have seen one of most gallant officer of acquaintance turn pale at sight of spider certainly one must think of calling one other coward assuredly such name must not be applied to man who must face tiger armed only with whip in defense of native woman because nerve go to piece at sound of firearm if have told before must never have spoken a did isobel pleaded did not go into full detail told that be not responsible for want of firmness under fire that knew in other respect to be brave man doctor said uncompromisingly since then have by manner driven away from have flirted well may not call flirting broke off in answer to gesture of denial be same thing with man who be undoubtedly gallant soldier very paladin if like who in spite of handsome face pleasant manner be more to be compared with bathurst in point of moral quality mental ability than light to dark after have like old fool gone out of way to warn have disappointed altogether isobel hannay isobel stood motionless before with downcast eye well there dear doctor went on hurriedly a saw tear glisten in eyelash let say anything more about in first place be affair of mine in second place point of view be that most woman must take at time like only know expected must not have done just a other woman must can not afford to quarrel now for there be doubt that although may put good face on matter position be one of grave peril be of use troubling over trifle now run away get few hour sleep if can will want strength before be through with business while doctor have be talking to isobel men have gathered below in sort of informal council subject being bathurst conduct on roof must not have believed if have not seen captain rintoul said man be absolutely helpless with fright never saw such exhibition then fainting afterwards having to be carried away be disgusting in fact be worse than that there be general murmur of assent be disgraceful one of civilian said be ashamed that man must belong to service idea of fellow being helpless by fright when there be woman child to be defended be downright revolting well did go stick up in front wilson said must remember that may have be in blue funk say be still know did go away try to hide stuck up in front for to fire at think ought to take into consideration dr wade say bathurst put there to try accustom to fire captain forster said mind pretend to like man be at school together be coward then sneak for one must look at fairly doctor asserts that bathurst be morally brave somehow other nerve be too much for pretend to understand there be doubt about doctor pluck think must stand up for bathurst a doe unless really thought be not altogether accountable for showing white feather think too from what let drop that major be to extent of same opinion what do think doolan like bathurst captain doolan said have always thought first rate fellow one ca stick up know for fellow who ca behave a gentleman ought to especially when there be woman child in danger be quite impossible that must associate with captain rintoul said propose that must tell what think of think ought to leave severely alone must say that ought to be sent to coventry richards said must not put in way mr hunter said gravely have always esteemed bathurst look upon a terribly sad case agree with captain rintoul in position in be now placed man who prof to be coward must be made to feel that stand apart from must not call sending to coventry anything of sort do think that must express by manner that wish to have communication with there be general expression of assent to opinion wilson alone protesting against can do a like said certainly will speak to bathurst be sure doctor major hannay will do so want to stand up for coward believe what doctor say have seen good deal of bathurst like besides have heard story doctor have be telling about attacking tiger with whip to save native woman care what anyone say fellow who be downright coward must do thing like who told doctor about farquharson asked if got from bathurst think go for much after what have seen wilson must have replied angrily captain doolan put hand on shoulder shut up wilson said be time for dispute be in one boat here must row together like brother go own way about bathurst blame for be man everyone have liked first rate official good fellow round except be not one of sociable kind at other time one must not think so much of at present for man to lack courage be for to lack everything hope will come better out of than look at present will have plenty of chance here one will be more glad than will to see pull together doctor however must have quarreled with everyone round when heard what have be decided upon have not major hannay taken aside talked to strongly will never do doctor to have quarrel here a commandant must beg of not to make personal matter be very sorry for poor fellow accept entirely view of matter at same time really ca blame others for looking at from matter of fact point of view want of courage be at time regarded by men a most unpardonable of failing at time like present feeling be naturally far stronger even than usual hope with that bathurst will retrieve yet will certainly do good by trying to fight battle until doe thinking a do will of course make alteration in manner towards be glad to hear that young wilson also stand a friend let matter go on quietly believe will come right in end doctor be obliged to acknowledge that major counsel be wise to refrain from argument sarcasm effort required to check natural tendency to wordy conflict be almost too great for when not engaged in own special duty spent hour in one of angle of terrace keenly watching tree bush within range firing vengefully whenever caught sight of lurking native so accurate be aim that sepoys soon learned to know dread crack of rifle whenever spoke out ground within range be speedily clear of foe matter however caused deep if temporary estrangement between wilson richards although constantly chaffing other engaged in verbal strife have hitherto be firm friend rivalry in matter of horseflesh have not aroused angry feeling even mutual adoration of isobel hannay have not affected breach in friendship upon subject of sending bathurst to coventry quarreled so hotly that for time broke off communication with other in heart regretted that schoolboy day have passed that must not settle matter in good schoolboy fashion chapter xiv though obliged to defer to major hannay wish to abstain from arguing with men question of bathurst being given cold shoulder dr wade have already organized lady in favor during afternoon have told tiger story have confidentially informed how be that bathurst from birth have be victim of something like nervous paralysis at loud sound especially of discharge of firearm conduct today said courage in rescuing that native girl from tiger illustrate character be cool brave determined a might be expected from man of so well balanced mind a even when nerve utterly broke down under din of musketry will be so far dominant that forced to go forward stand there under fire act be under circumstance simply heroic there be little difficulty in persuading woman a to merit of man like bathurst have since trouble began be much more appreciated than before by lady of deennugghur have felt there be something strengthening cheering in presence for while not attempting to minimize danger there be calm confidence in manner that comforted reassured talked to in last twenty four hour too have unobtrusively performed many little kindness have aided in removal carried child looked after servant have be foremost in arrangement of everything must add to comfort of lady be glad have told about doctor mr doolan said of course one must dream of blaming have heard that story about leaving army year ago although have only seen once twice did not believe for minute what tell now doctor explains whole matter pity sincerely must be something awful for man at time like not to be able to take part in defense especially when there be woman here why must pain le to see jim brought in dead than for to show white feather what can do for poor fellow treat just a usual there be nothing else can do mr doolan tone of sympathy still le of pity must be worst thing possible be in lowest depth at present if find by tone manner that regard on same footing a before will gradually come round hope that before end of siege will have opportunity of retrieving not under fire be hopeless in other way may be sure will do can doctor mr doolan said warmly there be plenty of way will be able to make most useful there be somebody wanted to look after syces servant must be comfort to to have someone to talk to occasionally besides child be fond of sentiment be warmly echoed thus when determination at men have arrived to cut bathurst became known there be something like feminine revolution may do a like mr doolan said indignantly if think that be going to do anything so cruel unjust be entirely mistaken can tell mr rintoul be equally emphatic mr hunter quietly with a much decision protested have always regarded mr bathurst a friend said will continue to do so be very sad for that can not take part in defense be more fair to blame than must be to blame because too be noncombatant isobel hannay have taken part in first discussion among lady did say anything now be cruel unjust said to herself only think a did be more cruel unjust than for there be talk of danger then expressed contempt of because there be suspicion that have showed cowardice ten year ago while have seen shown now when there be fearful peril if be cruel unjust what be later on men gathered together at one end of room talked over situation dr wade major said quietly will be obliged if will go ask mr bathurst to join know people round here better than of opinion will be valuable doctor who have several time be in to see bathurst went to room major want to join bathurst be having talk over thing wish to have opinion have better tell that a to yourself camp be divided into two party on one side be major wilson lady who take need not say common sense view of matter recognize that have done man must do to overcome constitutional nervousness that there be discredit attached to personally rest of men be sorry to say at present take view of case be disposed to show cold shoulder that of course bathurst said quietly a to lady view of know that be only result of good office doctor then will come doctor said pleased that bathurst seemed le depressed than have expected certainly will come doctor bathurst said rising worst be over now everyone know that be coward be what have dreaded there be nothing else for to be afraid of be of use hiding look quite at home here mr bathurst mr doolan said cheerfully a passed think feel great deal more comfortable than did when gave warning last night anticipation be always worse than reality not always think mr doolan said quietly have certainly made yourselves wonderfully at home though sewing be of more practical kind than upon be ordinarily engaged then passed on with doctor to other end of room major nodded a came up all right again now bathurst hope want opinion for know think more of zemindars in part of country than of of course question be will take part against be afraid will major have hoped otherwise if be true that nana have gone a other part of message be correct have doubt be so also be afraid will be carried away with stream think have gun have not least doubt of number given up be mere fraction of be said to have possessed have hoped troop must have marched away after lesson gave morning so far a can make out there be sign of movement in line however may start at daybreak tomorrow will go out to see if like major bathurst said quietly can get native clothes from servant speak language well enough to pas a native so if give permission will go out to line learn what intention be must be very dangerous undertaking major said gravely have fear whatever of danger of kind major nerve be steady enough except when there be noise of firearm then a saw morning can not control do what will risk of other kind be quite prepared to undertake in matter think danger be very slight only difficulty being to get through line of sentry have doubt posted round house once past think there be practically risk whatever of recognizing when made up a native doctor have doubt got iodine in surgery coat of will bring to right color well if be ready to undertake will not refuse major said how must propose to get out noticed yesterday that branch of one of tree in garden extended beyond top of wall will climb up lower on other side by rope be very simple matter spot be close to edge of mr hunter compound will work way through shrubbery till feel sure be beyond sentry who may be posted there chance be that will not be thick anywhere except opposite gate by way captain forster before go must thank for having risked life to save mine morning heard from mr hunter that be doctor who rushed forward drew back be not worth talking about captain forster said carelessly seemed bent on making target of yourself a major order be that everyone be to lie down there be nothing for to remove bathurst turned to dr wade will superintend get up doctor certainly doctor said with alacrity will guarantee that with aid of boy will turn out so that one must know even in broad daylight to say nothing of dark quarter of hour sufficed to metamorphose bathurst into oude peasant did not return to room accompanied by doctor made way to tree have spoken of by way have taken arm doctor said suddenly must be useless doctor if be recognized will be killed if be not discovered chance be very slight of being so will get back safely by way will tie knot on rope before let down used to be able to climb rope without doubt whether must do so now well god bless lad bring back safely may make a light of a will be dangerous expedition however be glad have undertaken come what may for have given opportunity of showing be not afraid of danger when take other form than of firearm there be plenty of men who must stand up bravely enough in fight who must not like to undertake task of going out alone in dark into middle of bloodthirsty scoundrel how long do think will be couple of hour at outside well at end of hour will be back here again be longer than can help lad for will be very anxious until return when doctor re entered house there be chorus of question have mr bathurst started why did not bring in here before left must have liked to have said goodby to yes have gone have seen over wall be much better that must go without fuss went off just a quietly unconcernedly a if have be going out for ordinary evening walk now be going up onto roof say must hear hubbub down at line if be discovered there must certainly hear shout if came across of sentry round house have taken arm doctor major asked none major asked if must not take pistol refused well understand captain forster remarked if have gone on business must have taken couple of revolver be quite ready to take chance of being killed fighting must not like to be seized hacked to piece in cold blood theory be man must sell life a dearly a can be animal instinct forster doctor said sharply though say must not feel same question whether bathurst be not higher type of courage well aspire to bathurst type of courage doctor forster said with short laugh doctor did not answer have already turned away be making for stair may go with doctor isobel hannay said following be very hot down here yes come along child there be time to lose for bathurst must be near where be likely to have posted sentry by time everything quiet wilson asked young subaltern who with be on guard on roof yes have heard nothing except few distant shout noise out at line round here there have be nothing moving except that heard someone go out into garden just now went out with doctor said have gone in disguise of native to sepoy line to find out what be intention heard talk over doctor only came up on watch few minute since thought be most likely when step hope be beyond sentry doctor said have come up here to listen expect be through before wilson said confidently wish must have gone with of course must not have be good be beautiful night be miss hannay there be scarcely dew falling now go off to post in corner wilson instruction be to listen for slightest sound to assure against sepoys creeping up to wall did not come up here to distract from duty to gossip there be richards posted somewhere in garden wilson said still suppose be right doctor if miss hannay have come up to listen come sit in corner be one nearest to line may a well go sit down isobel doctor said be if intend to stay up here long went across with wilson to post will put one of sandbag for to sit on must rather stand thank stood for time silently watching fire in line be drawing pretty heavily on wood store doctor growled there be good deal more than regulation allowance blazing in fire can make out lot of figure moving about round doubt number of peasant have come in do think mr bathurst have got beyond line of sentry isobel said after standing perfectly quiet for time oh yes long way probably be through by time came up here be not likely to post more than fifty sixty yard from wall indeed be a bathurst pointed out to probable that be only thick near gate want to do be to prevent slipping away must think that bathurst must be out near line by time isobel moved few pace away from others again stood listening suppose think that there be chance of attack tonight doctor wilson asked in low tone not in least native be not fond of night work expect be dividing spoil quarreling over anyhow have have enough of for today may intend to march away in morning may have sent to cawnpore to ask for order may have heard from of zemindars that be coming in to join be what bathurst have gone out to learn anyhow think will attack again with present force wish there be few more of said so that must venture on sortie so do lad be use thinking about a be have to wait fate be not in own hand think matter look bad doctor think must hardly look worse unless mutineer take into head to march away there be humanly speaking one chance for be lawrence may thrash sepoys so completely at lucknow that may be able to send out force to bring in chance of be next to nothing for in addition to very large sepoy force have population of lucknow one of most turbulent in india on hand ah what be two musket shot in quick succession from sepoy line broke silence of evening startled exclamation burst from girl standing near doctor went over to do think do think said in low strained voice that be bathurst not at if detected really see that there be chance of doing so disguised a be must have seized probably killed there must be no firing have gone unarmed know must offer resistance shot heard be doubtless result of drunken quarrel over loot do really think so doctor feel quite sure of if have be forster who have gone out have be detected must have be natural enough that must hear sound of something like battle in first place must have defended desperately in next might have made way through escaped a said with bathurst there must be occasion for firing why did come in to say goodby before went that be what wanted to ask doctor why came up here wanted to have spoken to if only for moment before started tried to catch eye a went out of room with did not even look at will be so hard if never come back to know that went away without having spoken to again did try morning to tell be sorry for what said must not listen to will have opportunity of telling when come back if want to of showing so by manner must be perhaps le painful to of care about pain to myself girl said have be unjust deserve think considers unjust did told so feel what considers disgrace so much that seems to perfectly natural must be despised yes want to see that be not despised said quickly understand doctor do understand perfectly dear at least think think do see that want to put straight with be very right proper especially placed a be must not do say anything hastily have spoken hastily once see made mess of must be careful how did again unless of course stopped unless what doctor isobel asked shyly after long pause there be reply looking round saw that companion have moved quietly away have joined wilson at post stood for few minute in same attitude then moved quietly across staircase in center of terrace went down to party below short time later doctor followed taking rifle went out into garden with captain doolan who assisted in climbing tree handed gun up to doctor made way out on branch to spot where extended beyond wall there sat straining eye into darkness hour passed then heard light footfall on sandy soil be that bathurst whispered all right doctor minute later bathurst sat on branch beside well what be news very bad doctor expect rajah por sing who seems be leader of party in district several other zemindars to be here with gun tomorrow next day news from cawnpore be true native troop mutinied marched away be joined by nana sahib force persuaded to return attack white in intrenchment at cawnpore a must not be well received at delhi unless have properly accomplished share of work of rooting out feringhees infernal scoundrel doctor exclaimed after pretending for year to be best friend be disgusted to think have drunk champagne dozen time however that make little difference to now other news be most important must have resisted sepoys for month if bring up gun there can be one ending to be so doctor only hope can see be that may find resistance so obstinate a to be glad to grant term of surrender yes there be that chance doctor agreed history show there be little reliance to be placed upon native oath bathurst be silent own experience of native have taught same lesson be poor hope said after while be only one so far a can see not word be spoken a descended tree walked across to house never mind about changing thing come straight in scout have returned doctor said a entered room there be general exclamation of gladness on part of lady who have not retired be very glad to see safe back mr bathurst mr hunter said going up to taking hand have be very anxious since left danger be very slight mr hunter only wish have brought back news that native line be deserted mutineer in full march for delhi lucknow be afraid must hardly bring news mr bathurst be almost too good to hope for however be glad that be back be not isobel be indeed mr bathurst though a yet can hardly persuade that be in get up think there be doubt of identity can tell where uncle be miss hannay have to make report to be on roof there be sort of general gathering of defender there two lamp have be placed in center of terrace round little garrison be grouped sitting on box others lying on mat almost smoking bathurst be greeted heartily by major wilson a soon a be recognized be awfully glad to see back wilson said shaking warmly by hand wish must have gone with two together doe not seem so bad must not like to start out by a did there be hearty cordiality in young fellow voice be very pleasant to bathurst have gift a hawkeye used to say a have doubt remember wilson such gift a have lay in way of solitary work fancy now light cheroot bathurst major said drink off tumbler of brandy soda then let hear story story be simple enough major got through without difficulty sentry be distance apart round garden wall a soon a discovered by sound of footstep where be be easy enough to get through then made longish detour came down on line from other side there be occasion for concealment then number of country people have come in be gathered round sepoys fire be able to move about amongst listen to conversation without smallest hindrance sepoys be loudly expressing dissatisfaction at officer leading against house today when have mean of battering down wall scaling then there be general opinion that treachery be at work for how else must european have known be going to rise morning so moved during night into house there be much angry recrimination quarreling many expressed regret have not marched straight to cawnpore after burning bungalow be satisfactory learned that por sing several other zemindars have already sent in assurance that be wholly with must be here with gun to batter down wall time tomorrow be bad news indeed major said gravely when have finished of course when heard that nana sahib have thrown in lot with mutineer be probable that many of landowner must go same way if sepoys have marched off might not have attacked on own account now know that sepoys be going to stay that will have gun alters position altogether there be murmur of assent must tell before talk matter over further bathurst went on during last hour hundred of peasant have taken up post round house in addition to sepoy sentry came back with one party about hundred strong be posted couple of hundred yard so in front of gate slipped away from in dark made way here well gentleman what do think have better do major said be in same boat must like to have opinion may defend house successfully for day possibly may even tire out on other hand may prove too strong for if wall be breached must hardly hope to defend indeed if constructed plenty of ladder must scale at night in score of place must therefore regard house a citadel close up lower window door with sandbag defend to last still if be determined lookout be not very bright one be in favor of cutting way out major captain forster said if be cooped up here must a say in long run be beaten must be very well captain forster if be men mr hunter said there be sixteen of there be in eighteen horse for farquharson have two there be eight woman fourteen child so horse must have to carry double certainly must not hope to escape from with horse so laden if came up with fighting must do with woman behind saddle moreover certainly must not leave servant who have be true to to mercy of sepoys besides where must go doctor asked garrison at cawnpore know be besieged by overwhelming number know much a to position at lucknow certainly european be immensely outnumbered there think may assume that be also besieged be very long distance either to agra to allahabad with whole country up in arm against cavalry here at heel prospect seems absolutely hopeless what do think doolan rintoul have wife here have child consider that question concern married men more than be case of frying pan fire a far a can see doctor at rate here have got wall to light behind food for week plenty of ammunition be for selling life a dearly a can here rather than go outside to be chased like jackal agree with doolan captain rintoul said here may be able to make term with once outside wall must be at scoundrel mercy if be not for woman child must agree entirely with forster best plan must be to throw open gate make dash for keeping together a long a must then if necessary separating trying to make way down to agra allahabad a best must with lady doe not seem to be possible opinion of married civilian be entirely in accord with of mr hunter what hope be there of defending place in long run captain forster said if saw chance at must be quite willing to wait must infinitely rather sally out at once go for be killed than wait here day after day perhaps week after week seeing one fate drawing nearer inch by inch what do say bathurst have have opinion yet think that defense be so hopeless a suppose although admit that chance be greatly against bathurst said quietly think there be hope of tiring native out sepoys know well enough there can be no great amount of loot here while think that be at cawnpore at lucknow still more at delhi chance of plunder must be much greater moreover think that men in position having offended a be without hope of pardon must naturally desire to flock together there be comfort encouragement in number therefore be sure will very speedily become impatient if meet with success must be inclined to grant term rather than waste time here be same thing with native gentry will want to be off to lucknow delhi where will know more how thing be going where doubt reckon upon obtaining post of importance increased possession under new order of thing therefore think a well a sepoys be likely if find task longer more difficult than expect to be ready to grant term have great faith in native oath still might be kept captain forster proposal regard a altogether impracticable be something like two hundred fifty mile from nearest british post where must hope to find refuge with horse carrying double trooper at heel directly start country hostile see chance whatever not vestige of one of getting safely away there be third alternative by might escape be that must make way out on foot break up into party of two three steal fight way through sentry then for party to shift for making way a best can traveling by night lying up in wood plantation by day getting food at time from friendly native subsisting for most part upon what might be gathered in field in way might escape suffering hardship of woman child must be terrible agree with mr hunter said journey must be frightful to contemplate think in case that wife must possibly perform such journey still might do so at rate think chance be better than must be be to ride out in body must suggest major when crisis seems to be approaching be when be clear that ca defend much longer must be fair that must be at liberty to try to get out make down country certainly major agreed be in position of men on board sinking ship with boat gone must try to end to save ship when hope of doing be over may try to get to shore a best can a long a house can be defended must remain bear share in struggle when decide that be question of hour who choose will be at liberty to try to escape will be vastly more difficult then than now captain forster said bathurst made way out tonight without difficulty will be great deal more vigilant when know can not hold out much longer see how must be possible for woman child to get through might then adopt scheme to certain extent forster major hannay said must mount sally out suddenly break through picket a soon a be beyond scatter who like can try to make way down on horseback who prefer try to do so on foot must at least give alternative must siege be pushed on to last find unable to make term there be general assent to major proposal seemed to offer better chance than there be hope that mutineer might tire of siege march away that if pressed term might be at last obtained from that failing everything else garrison might yet make way down country a there be evidently chance of attack during night major said will divide into two watch relieve other four hour will give two a lookout on roof six in inclosure a be senior officer next to myself doolan will take charge of one watch will myself take charge of other forster wilson be with rintoul richards with mr hardy will other gentleman divide number into two watch dr wade count a combatant until hospital begin to fill fancy may be counted a combatant through doctor muttered tomorrow morning major went on will continue work of filling sandbag there be still large number of empty bag on hand will want for lower window door more there be of better must also keep supply in readiness to make retrenchment if must breach wall now mr hunter a soon a have made out list watch can go on duty must advise others to turn in without delay when lady be informed that men be going on watch mr doolan said have amendment to propose major woman ear be just a keen a men propose that supply sentry on roof will volunteer for one whole of lady at once volunteered there be occasion for so many mr doolan said propose that tonight at rate must take first watch with one of miss hunter miss hannay other must take second will leave gentleman available for watch in inclosure proposal be agreed to in short time first watch have taken station rest of garrison lay down to rest night passed off quietly first work at major set garrison in morning be to form six wooden stage against wall one by gate one against wall at other end two at of long side of inclosure be twelve foot in height enabled upon to stand head shoulder above level of wall when be completed whole of garrison including lady native servant again set to work filling sandbag with earth a fast a be finished be carried in piled two deep against lower window three deep against door only one small door being left undefended so a to allow passage in out of house bag be piled in readiness for closing also in case of necessity mr rintoul lady have volunteered for third watch on roof so that watch must go on duty once twelve hour whole of men therefore be available for work below scattered fire be opened at house soon after daybreak be kept up without intermission from bush other cover watcher on roof seated behind sandbag at opposite angle be well under shelter peering out occasionally through crevice between bag to see that general movement be taking place among enemy about midday there be desultory discharge of firearm from native line major on ascending to roof saw procession of elephant men approaching camp expect there be gun there muttered be going to begin in earnest lady be relieved of duty at present expect will be hearing from fellow soon must have someone up here who can talk back to accordingly doctor mr farquharson who be best shot among civilian took place of lady on roof hour later major went up again have four cannon doctor said there be on slight rise to left of line must fancy be about eight hundred yard away do see there be crowd gathering behind rifle will carry distance easily enough think might a well let have three four more up here two lad be fair shot hunter be considered good shikari year ago can drive cannon off rise farther make take up post better even at distance shooting will be wild gun be doubt old one a likely a not shot wo fit at rate though may trouble will do serious harm till establish battery at pretty close quarter major went down two subaltern mr hunter joined doctor on roof ten minute later boom of four gun in quick succession be heard party below stopped for moment at work a heard sound of shot rushing through air overhead then came five shot in answer from parapet again again rifle spoke out then doctor shouted down to in courtyard have have enough of already be bringing up elephant to move cannon back now boy said to subaltern elephant be easier mark than tiger aim carefully blaze away a quickly a like for five minute rapid fire be kept up then wilson went below doctor asked to tell sir said to major that gun have be removed there have be great confusion among native can see with glass eight ten body left on ground one of elephant turned went off at full speed among crowd fancy of others be hit there be great trouble in getting to come up to gun doctor say be over for present two other large party with elephant be seen to come up to native line in course of afternoon defender of roof have now turned attention to foe in garden around fire thence be gradually suppressed until by evening everything be quiet by time work of filling sandbag be completed door window have be barricaded large pile of bag lay in inclosure ready for erection at threatened point chapter xv when party met at dinner be for time silent for be exhausted by hard work under blazing sun spirit rose under surroundings native servant have laid table with a scrupulous care a usual except that there be display of flower change be observable have dressed after work be over men be in white drill lady have from custom put on light evening gown cook have prepared excellent dinner a champagne went round stranger must have supposed that party have met under unusual circumstance doctor two subaltern be unaffectedly gay a rest made effort to be cheerful languor have marked commencement of dinner soon wore off wilson richards be becoming quite sportsman doctor said have tried hand at tiger must hardly have expected to take part in elephant shooting ca quite settle between a to be who sent rajah elephant flying among crowd declare aimed at special beast so a there be deciding point must consider honor a divided be rather hard on isobel said to be kept working below instead of being up there seeing what be going on consider quite did full share towards defense today hand be quite sore with sewing up mouth of rough bag think chief honor way lie with mr rintoul be sure sewed more bag than of have idea that be worker mr rintoul used to be quick worker miss hannay till lately have not touched needle since came out to india must recommend to keep up mr rintoul doctor said have done more good than medicine believe have prescribed for for last month have seen looking so well since came out suppose have not have time to feel ill doctor mr rintoul said with slight smile have be sort of tonic very useful one mr rintoul be of better for little stirring up sometimes captain forster have a usual secured place next to isobel hannay have be near day carrying bag a filled to to sew up bathurst be sitting at other end of table joining little in conversation thought bathurst be going to faint again when firing began miss hannay captain forster said in low voice be quite funny to see give little start shot be fired face be a white a jacket never saw such nervous fellow know can not help captain forster isobel said indignantly think be right to make fun of for what be great misfortune be not making fun of miss hannay be pitying did not sound like isobel said think can understand captain forster must be terrible to be like quite agree with there know must drown put bullet through head if must not show ordinary courage with lot of lady going on working quietly round must remember that mr bathurst showed plenty of courage in going out among mutineer last night yes did that very well see talk language so thoroughly that a said there be very little risk in like to talk so captain forster isobel said quietly see much of mr bathurst have not spoken to dozen time in last month uncle dr wade have high opinion of consider that must be personally blamed for being nervous under fire feel very sorry for must much rather that did not make remark like about have weak point doubt many of be good deal worse than mere want of nerve command will be obeyed miss hannay did not know that bathurst be protege of major a well a of estimable doctor must have said nothing against think mr bathurst be sort of man to be anyone protege captain forster isobel said coldly however think have better change subject captain forster did easily adroitly have special feeling against bathurst save contempt for weakness a have met once twice at major since came to station have not thought of in light of rival just a dinner be over richards one of civilian came down from terrace think that there be something up major can hear noise somewhere near where mr hunter bungalow be what sort of noise richards there be sort of murmur a if there be good many men there well gentleman have better go to post major said doolan please place watch on platform by wall will take party up onto terrace doctor will bring up of rocket made other day must try find out what be doing a soon a gained terrace with party major requested everyone to remain perfectly still going forward to parapet

open fire be not least use going there exposing to be shot when know that will be of use showed yesterday that must be of use in other way have doubt will have opportunity of doing so again can assure none of will think worse of for not being able to struggle against nervous affliction give infinite pain if be attacking must be different know must be wanting to take share then thank mr hunter said must go up grant that will be of use at least will take chance that others run of being shot man doe not flinch from painful operation whatever pain have to be faced may get used to in time whether do not must go through though say doe hurt at moment rattle of musketry broke out above bathurst gave violent start low cry a of pain then rushed past mr hunter up staircase to terrace when staggered rather than walked forward to parapet threw down beside two figure who be in act of firing be that bathurst major voice asked mind man lift head above sandbag in way there have best lie quiet native have idea of attacking be of use throwing away valuable ammunition by firing unless hand be steady bathurst did not hear remained with head above line of sandbag until major put hand on shoulder forced down might have put hand over ear to deaden sound for in darkness one must have seen action must not do so with clenched teeth quivering nerve lay there until major said fancy have stopped

still working there light of rocket showed that there be now native at spot where have be seen at work thought must be too hot for major at such close quarter a must have played mischief with better doctor will send few shot there occasionally to show have not forgotten principal thing will be to keep ear open to see that bring up ladder try rush think there be fear of tonight major must not have set to work at battery if have idea of trying to scale wall with ladder will come later on think will be troubled more tonight except by fellow firing away from bush must think must get tired of

present at rate will gladly undertake work of looking after store servant there be one thing have be thinking of must like to speak to about at once if must spare minute two before turn in what be bathurst think that be agreed major that though may hold place for time sooner later must either surrender place be carried by storm major hannay nodded be what must come to bathurst if will at last grant term well good if not must either try to escape die fighting be about escape have be thinking major a position grows more more desperate will close round although might have possibly got through last night chance of doing so when have once broken into inclosure begin to attack house be very slight few of who can speak language well might possibly in disguise get away must be impossible for bulk of to do so quite see that bathurst proposal be major that must begin at once to mine be to drive gallery from cellar to carry on steadily a far a can must say that have ten day fortnight before before matter get to extremity in time ought to be able to get working night day from fifty to hundred yard beyond wall aiming at clump of bush there be large one in farquharson compound about hundred yard off then when thing get to worst can work upwards come out on dark night might leave long fuse burning in magazine so that there must be explosion hour two after have left there be enough powder there to bring house down sepoys might suppose that have be buried in ruin think idea be very good one bathurst what do think doctor capital doctor said be light sandy soil must be able to get through at pretty good rate how many can work together do think bathurst must say two of in shift to drive if necessary prop roof with of native to carry out earth if have three shift shift must go on twice

richards herbert will make third party after breakfast can pick out twelve strongest of native will tell that have to work that will be paid half rupee day in addition to ordinary wage then will give general supervision to work bathurst in addition to own share in certainly major will take general charge of so at breakfast major explained plan agreed upon five men chosen at once expressed willingness to undertake work offer of rupee extra day be sufficient to induce twelve of servant to volunteer for major went down to cellar fixed upon spot at work must begin bathurst wilson taking of intrenching tool from storeroom began to break through wall without delay like wilson said be thousand time better than sitting up there waiting till choose to make attack how wide will make a narrow a can for one to pas along at time bathurst said narrower be le trouble will have with roof only one will be able to work at time in case will be quite enough bathurst said will be hot work hard will relieve other five minute so very short time sufficed to break through wall thank goodness be earth wilson said thrusting crowbar through opening a soon a be made have fear of being rock wilson if have be must not have taken trouble to have walled side of cellar soil be very deep over here native have to line well thirty forty foot down enemy be quiet day garrison thought likely that warned by lesson of night before be erecting battery distance farther back masked by tree until be ready to open fire must know nothing about so have turned miner mr wilson isobel hannay said to a after change bath came in to get lunch calculate have lost stone in weight miss hannay if be to go on at for month two there must be nothing left of how far did drive hole gallery miss hannay please call gallery

garden what fun used to have there when be young one wonder what dear old governor mater must say if knew fix be in here know sometimes think that forster plan be best that must be better to try make dash through be in way mr wilson must be able to do much fighting if have one of clinging to know miss hannay wilson said quietly what fighting power be fancy if be clinging to must cut way through good deal be sure must do anything that anyone must do girl said kindly might feel having person behind must not hamper awfully must infinitely rather try to escape on foot for then must be relying on while if be riding behind anyone be pursued attacked must feel time be destroying chance that if be not for must get away must be terrible know whether be wise to stay here instead of trying to escape at once a uncle mr hunter others thought wiser to stay have doubt be be quite sure that must not have be good plan to go off like on horseback day passed quietly then during night watch heard sound of blow with ax of falling tree be clearing ground in front of battery major who be on watch with party said will begin in earnest tomorrow morning sound came from just where expected be about in same line a where made first attempt hundred yard so further back at daylight saw that tree bush have be leveled battery with embrazures for six gun erected at distance of about four hundred yard from house more sandbag be at once brought up from below parapet on side facing battery raised two foot doubled in thickness garrison be not disturbed while so engaged why deuce fellow begin captain forster said impatiently a stood looking over parapet when work be finished expect be waiting for rajah of principal zemindars to come down replied major gun be theirs see will most likely be worked by own follower doubt think will knock place to piece in few minute listen there be music be coming in grand state rintoul will tell worker in mine to come up by way who be at work now bathurst wilson sir then tell wilson to come up request bathurst to go on with gallery tell want that pushed forward a fast a possible that one gun will not make much difference here request lady child to go down into storeroom for present think ball will go through wall be a well to be on safe side captain rintoul delivered message to lady have already heard that battery have be unmasked be ready to open fire lamp have be placed in storeroom in readiness for there be pale face among thought be of on roof rather than of mr hunter took up bible have be reading said tell captain rintoul will be praying for lady went into room served a nursery with ayah other female servant carried child down into storeroom must much rather be up there isobel said to mr doolan must load musket for think must be anything like so bad if must see what be going on a being cooped up below fancying worst time quite agree with men never will get to understand woman perhaps before be done will recognize fact that be more afraid than be music be heard approaching along road where bungalow have stood presently number of flag be raised in battery amid great beating of drum on previous day flagstaff have be erected on roof union jack be run up in answer to enemy demonstration cheer for old flag lad major said hearty cheer broke from little party on roof where with exception of bathurst garrison be assembled cheer be answered by yell from native not only in battery from garden inclosure round house pay attention to fellow in garden major said fire at gun must expose to load men be kneeling behind parapet where sandbag have be so arranged that must see through between on upper line thus fire without raising head above will wait for fire first major doctor asked expect gun be loaded laid doctor if see head looking along by mean take shot at wish must see down into battery be too high for that doctor lay looking along rifle presently fired a if have be signal five cannon boomed out almost at same moment other being fired quarter of minute later three of shot struck house below parapet others went overhead hit man doctor said a thrust rifle through loophole now will see if can keep from loading simultaneously with roar of cannon rattle of musketry broke out on three side of house hail of bullet whistled over head of defender who opened steady fire at embrasure of gun have be run in native must be seen loading major examined work through pair of field glass be doing well said presently have seen several of fall there be lot of confusion among will soon get tired of game slowly irregularly gun be run out again fire of defender be redoubled to prevent from taking aim only one shot hit house time others going overhead fire of enemy became slower more irregular at end of hour ceased almost entirely doctor major said will get farquharson to turn attention to fellow there be in high tree over there command completely many of bullet have struck on terrace behind must not be safe to move across to stair now think have pretty well silenced battery for present here be glass with can easily make out fellow among leaf see doctor said handing glass to farquharson will soon get out of now farquharson take that fellow out on lower branch to right will take one close to trunk on same branch laying rifle on upper row of sandbag two men took steady aim fired almost together two body be seen to fall from tree well shot major exclaimed there be something like dozen of up there will soon clear out if keep that up be not more than two hundred yard away doctor said firing from rest certainly ought not to miss at distance give glass again similar success attended next two shot then number of figure be seen hastily climbing down give volley gentleman major said dozen gun be fired three more men dropped angry yell from native answered shout of triumph from garrison will go down mr hunter tell lady that have silenced gun for present that one have received scratch now let see what damage ball have effected be found to be trifling stonework of house be strong gun be light stonework of one of window be broken two three stone in wall cracked one ball have entered window torn way through two inner wall lay against back wall be four pound ball major said taking up fancy gun be seven pounder have evidently ball to fit account for badness of firing little damage did with so much windage ball can have have small velocity well be satisfactory beginning gentleman will take long time to knock place about ear at rate now will see if can not clear out of garden captain doolan will take glass watch battery if see movement about gun fire will be reopened at once until then will devote attention to fellow among bush be important to teach that be not safe there for chance ball might come in between sandbag of pick out particular bush watch till see exact position in anyone firing from must be in then try to silence throw away shot if can help have good stock of ammunition be a well not to waste will leave in command at present doolan major hannay then went down to storeroom have come to relieve from confinement lady said be glad to say that find ball will not penetrate wall of house alone there be therefore fear whatever of passing through garden wall together therefore a long a wall be intact there be reason why must not remain on floor above there be general exclamation of pleasure will be vastly better uncle isobel said be hateful being hidden away down here when have nothing to do to listen to firing see why of must not go up on terrace to load rifle for not at present isobel be not pressed yet when come to real attack will be time to consider about think of must shoot straighter if there be woman right up among in danger at see why must be worse being in danger than for men major mr doolan said have just a much at stake more warn will organize female mutiny if be not allowed to help major laughed well mr doolan will have to convert storeroom into prison who defy authority will be immured here so now know consequence of disobedience have one be hurt with that firing major hannay mary hunter asked good many people have be hurt miss hunter one on side fancy must have made very hot for at gun doctor mr farquharson have be teaching not to climb tree at present that firing hear be against who be hiding in garden hour later firing ceased altogether native finding fire of defender so deadly that longer dared by discharging rifle to show where be hiding have drawn off from more distant clump bush dared not try crawl from nearer house until after next morning be found that during night enemy have closed up embrasure leaving only opening sufficiently large for muzzle of gun to be thrust through soon after daybreak renewed fire doctor mr farquharson alone remained on roof throughout day kept up steady fire at opening whenever gun be withdrawn several of sandbag be knocked off parapet during course of day few shot found way through wall of upper story beyond damage be done mining be kept up with great vigor gallery advanced rapidly servant finding very hard work to remove earth a fast a miner brought down captain forster offered to go out with three others at night to try get into battery spike gun major hannay must not permit attempt to be made know have several other gun said risk must be altogether too great for there must be practically chance of getting back being drawn up over wall before be overtaken even if succeeded in spiking gun there be probably hundred men sleeping in battery be likely must have sentry out in front of loss of four men must seriously weaken garrison next morning battery to left be unmasked on following day three gun be planted under cover so a to play against gate first battery now concentrated fire upon outer wall new battery played upon upper part of house three gun kept up steady fire at gate there be little rest for besieged now be constant duel between rifle gun varied by occasionally turning attention to men who climbed tree who from roof of building still standing endeavored to keep down fire wilson have be released from labor in gallery bathurst undertaking to get down earth single handed a fast a servant must remove never saw such fellow to work miss hannay wilson said one day when be off duty happened to find working alone at bandage know like be first rate fellow if there ever be one be unlucky for being so nervous at gun be fault of after be sure in other thing be a cool a possible yesterday be standing close to shoving earth back to men a got down suddenly shouted 'run wilson roof be coming down ' must not help bolting few yard for earth came pattering down a spoke then looked round saw standing there by light of lamp like figure see holding up pillar forget what call catydigs something of sort caryatides isobel put in yes be name timber have given way above be holding up with arm must say that there must have be ton of said a quietly a possible 'get two of short pole wilson put up one on side of can hold bit be longer than can help about ' managed to shove up timber so that must slip out before came down must have crushed to certainty if have not held up why do say know like mr bathurst exactly know miss hannay have noticed be only lady who doe not chat with think have seen speak to since have come in here be sorry because like very much care for forster at what have captain forster to do with isobel asked somewhat indignantly oh nothing at miss hannay only know bathurst used to be good deal at major before forster came then after never met there except on evening before came in here now know miss hannay went on earnestly what think about have not be such as a to suppose ever have chance though know must lay down life for willingly did not seem to mind bathurst know be awfully good fellow must have made very happy feel like with forster there be nothing in world must like better than to punch head when see that fellow like have cut bathurst out altogether make so savage sometimes have to go smoke pipe outside so a not to break out have row with ought not to talk so mr wilson be very wrong have right to say that anyone have cut anyone else out a far a be concerned know be fond of in brotherly sort of way like very much that give no right to say such thing about other people mr bathurst ceased visit not because of captain forster from reason altogether certainly have said done anything must justify saying that captain forster have cut mr bathurst out even if have ought not to have alluded to such thing be not angry with said seeing how downcast looked must not talk like more must be wrong at time be specially so now when be shut up here together none can say what will happen to seemed to that be just reason why must speak about miss hannay may none of get out of fix be in do think ought to be friend together now richards agreed that a be certain neither of have chance of winning next best thing be to see bathurst come together well now be over of course be wrong for to ask how be have come to dislike dislike mr wilson well then why do go on a if did like isobel hesitated from most men must have considered question impertinent must have resented frank faced boy meant impertinence loved in honest way only wanted to see happy ca speak to if doe speak to said desperately of course not agreed why must speak to ca have done anything to offend except taking up with forster be nothing to do with captain forster at mr wilson hesitated said something at have right to feel hurt offended have never given opportunity since of saying be sorry be sure must not have said anything that must have be offended about miss hannay be not nature must not believe told not even so must be in fault of course have nothing more to say about be in fault at mr wilson ca tell said be very wrong thoughtless on part have be sorry for ever since have perfect right to be hurt not to come near especially a hesitated a have acted badly since have reason for supposing be sorry now must not ask more about know why have said a much to a have only know can trust like very much though must never like in sort of way must want to wish did like like oh never mind said earnestly be all right miss hannay never expected anything know so be not disappointed have be awfully good of talking to a have not getting mad with for interfering can hear coming down from terrace must be off be on duty there know now bathurst have undertaken double work in hole did like really seemed mean to be getting out of work letting do said that liked work really think doe be sure be always worrying because ca take share in firing on roof when be working have time to think about when told that in future must drive tunnel shift said 'that will enable to take place on roof wilson must remember be firing for of so throw away shot be awfully rough on be well goodby miss hannay wilson hurried off to roof chapter xvi next four day made great alteration in position of defender in fortified house upper story be now riddled by ball parapet round terrace have be knocked away in several place gate be in splinter a earth from tunnel have be all emptied against sandbag have grown to such thickness that defense be still good here in wall against one of new battery have steadily directed fire there be yawning gap be hourly increasing in size must ere long be practicable for assault many of shot passing through have struck house of have penetrated room in line of fire must no longer be used there have be several casualty young civilian herbert have be killed by shot struck parapet just where be lying captain rintoul have be seriously wounded two of native have be killed by first shot penetrated lower room mr hunter be prostrate with fever result of exposure to sun several others have received wound more le severe from fragment of stone fire of defender be a steady a at first loss of native working gun be severe no longer ventured to fire from garden shrubbery round wall fatigue watching still more heat on terrace be telling heavily upon strength of garrison lady went about work quietly almost silently constant anxiety confinement in darkened room be telling upon too several of child be ill when not employed in other thing there be fresh sandbag to be made by woman to take place of damaged by enemy shot when of evening portion of defender came off duty there be more talk conversation a endeavored to keep up good face assume confidence be far from feeling doctor be perhaps most cheery of party during daytime be always on roof rifle seldom cracked in vain in evening attended to patient talked cheerily to lady laughed joked over event of day none among lady showed greater calmness courage than mr rintoul not word be ever heard from time siege began of ailment inconvenience be mr hunter best assistant with sick child even after husband be wounded attention night day be given to still kept on patiently firmly know how to admire mr rintoul enough mr hunter said to isobel hannay one day formerly have patience with be always querulous grumbling now have turned out really noble woman one never know people dear till one see in trouble everyone be nice isobel said have hardly heard word of complaint about anything since came here everyone seems to help others do little kindness enemy fire have be very heavy day breach in wall have be widened garrison felt certain that enemy must attack on following morning farquharson doctor must stop on roof major said in first place be possible may try to attack by ladder at other point will want two good shot up there to keep back in second if do force breach will want to cover retreat into house will get dozen rifle for of loaded in readiness isobel mary hunter who have volunteered over over again will go up to load have practiced can load quickly of course if see that enemy be not attacking at other point will help at breach by keeping up steady fire on always keep six gun in reserve will blow whistle a signal for to retire to house if find can hold breach no longer so when hear that blaze away at a fast a can twelve shot will check long enough to give time to get in fasten door will be round corner of house before can get fairly over breastwork will set to work to raise a soon a get dark breastwork of sandbag have already be erected behind breach in case enemy must make sudden rush couple of hour labor transformed into strong work for bag be already filled only needed placing in position when completed extended in horseshoe shape fifteen foot across behind gap in wall for nine foot from ground be composed of sandbag three deep single line be then laid along edge to serve a parapet think will get over major said when work be finished doubt if will be disposed even to try when reach breach before beginning work have cleared away fallen brickwork from behind breach number of brick be laid on top of sandbag to be used a missile brick be a good a musket ball at distance major said when gun be empty can take to there be enough spare rifle for to have five with revolver brick ought to be able to account for army there be of servant syces who can be trusted to load can stand down behind can pas gun down to a empty man have place on work assigned to bathurst who have before told major when time came for assault to be delivered be determined to take place in breach be placed at one end of horseshoe where touched wall promise to be of much use major said quietly know too well at least can run chance of being killed major have put wilson next to think there be much chance of storming work wilson if do catch hold of bathurst arm drag away when hear whistle chance be hundred to one against hearing remembering what mean if doe hear right major will look to four men remained on guard at breach night at first gleam of daylight garrison took up post now mind dear doctor said a farquharson went up on terrace with isobel mary hunter must do exactly a be told will be doing more harm than good for farquharson must not be able to pay attention to shooting must lie down remain perfectly quiet till begin to fire then keep behind just so far that can reach gun a hand back to after firing must load kneeling sitting down so that expose head above thickest part of breastwork when have loaded push gun back well to right of so that can reach then if one of go off there wo be chance of being hit garrison ca afford to throw away life at present will of course only half cock still be a well to provide against accident girl be pale be quiet steady doctor saw be not likely to break down be rum looking weapon have got there bathurst wilson said a after carrying down spare gun placing ready for firing lay down in position on sandbag weapon be native one be short mace composed of bar of iron about fifteen inch long with knob of same metal studded with spike bar be covered with leather to break jar have loop to put hand through at end yes bathurst said quietly picked up at one of native shop in cawnpore last time be there have idea then might ever have to use bought rather a curiosity have kept within reach of bedside since trouble began think one must want better weapon at close quarter be tremendous thing after way have seen using that pick must not like to be within reach of arm with mace in think there be much chance of wanting have fear of native getting over here time have fear of native at bathurst said be only afraid of at present be just a cool a if there be not native within thousand mile be sure that pulse be not going beat faster than usual can think of whole thing calculate chance a calmly a if be affair in be in way concerned be not danger that fear in slightest be that horrible noise know well enough that moment firing begin will be paralyzed only hope be that at last moment if come to hand to hand fighting will get nerve have doubt will wilson said warmly when do must back at long odds against of ah be beginning a spoke there be salvo of gun on three sepoy battery then roar of musketry broke out round house above must be heard loud shout be coming major doctor shouted down from roof sepoys be leading there be crowd of native behind lying in middle of curve of horseshoe soon caught sight of enemy advancing tumultuously towards breach major have ordered that not shot be to be fired until reached be evident that silence of besieged awed assailant with sense of unknown danger for pace slackened when got to within fifty yard of breach paused opened fire then urged forward by officer encouraged by own noise again rushed forward two of officer led way a mounted little heap of rubbish at foot of breach two rifle cracked out from terrace fell dead there be yell of fury from sepoys then poured in through breach in front tried to stop a saw trap into be entering pressed on by behind be forced forward now crackling fire of musketry broke out from rifle projecting between sandbag into crowded mass shot told wild shriek yell curse rose from assailant tried madly to climb up sandbag to force way back through crowd behind threw down others discharged musket at invisible foe from roof doctor companion kept up rapid fire upon crowd struggling to enter breach a fast a defender musket be discharged handed down to servant behind to be reloaded when have fired spare musket betook to revolver wilson while discharging rifle kept eye upon bathurst latter have not fired shot lay rigid still save for sort of convulsive shuddering presently there be little lull in firing a weapon be emptied defender seizing brick hurled down into mass look out major shouted keep head low be going to throw canister number of have be prepared filled to mouth with powder bullet with short fuse attached rope being fastened round to enable to be slung distance major half rose to throw one of missile when attention be called by shout from wilson latter be so occupied that have not noticed bathurst who have suddenly risen to foot just a wilson be about to grasp pull down leaped over sandbag in front of down among mutineer major gave swing to canister of fuse be already lighted hurled through breach among crowd who ignorant of what be going on inside be still struggling to enter look out shouted to others mind

volley at breach shouted never mind below musket be fired a soon a received now to foot major cried give brickbat a stood up hurled two more canister among crowd behind breach others sprang up with cheer inclosure below be willower now from number have fallen be filled with confused mass of struggling men in midst be bathurst fighting desperately with short weapon bringing down man at blow mutineer being too crowded together to use unfixed bayonet against in moment captain forster leaped down sword in hand joined bathurst in fight stand steady major shouted let man move missile still rained down with occasional shot a rifle be handed up by native while doctor farquharson kept up almost continuous fire from terrace then two last canister thrown by major exploded first two have carried havoc among crowd behind breach completed confusion turned fled while in retrenchment relieved of pressure from behind at once turned flying through breach followed companion loud cheer broke from garrison major looking round saw doctor standing by parapet waving hat while isobel stood beside looking down at scene of conflict lie down isobel shouted will be opening fire again directly girl disappeared almost at same moment battery spoke out again crackle of musketry began from garden major turned round bathurst be leaning against wall breathing heavily after exertion forster be coolly wiping sword on tunic of one of fallen sepoys be of hurt asked be not hurt to speak of forster said got rip with bayonet a jumped down think be of consequence how be bathurst major repeated what on

because can only help in nursing sick while others be fighting for have of gift few men have more than have courage coolness in other way be wrong to care nothing for life because of failing for be not accountable of nerve to stand sound of firearm can understand feeling sympathize with be of use to exaggerate importance of such matter might live thousand life without being again in position when failing must be of slightest importance one way other now come in with certainly be not moment for to give way about for feeling may have be may have impelled to act have on occasion fought nobly not nobly mr doolan said rising to foot desperately madly if like at moment wilson came out halloa bathurst what be doing here breakfast be just ready everyone be asking for be sure must want something after exertion must have seen laying about with iron mace mr doolan have seen using pick knew how strong be be astonished can tell be sort of coeur de lion business used to use mace know once rode through saracen smashed up till at last when have done must open hand bring in mr doolan if wo come will go in send doctor out to bad business poor richards being hurt be awfully good fellow richards ca think why be one to be hit so keeping up string of talk young subaltern led bathurst into house after breakfast white flag be waved from roof in short time two sepoy officer came up with similar flag major captain doolan went out to meet be agreed that hostility must be suspended until noon in order that wounded dead might be carried off while be being done garrison remained under arm behind work at breach lest treacherous attempt must be made mutineer however who be evidently much depressed by failure carried body off quietly at twelve o'clock firing recommenced that evening after be dark men gathered on terrace well gentleman major said have beaten off today may do again there be doubt how must end see afternoon gun have be firing at fresh place in wall if make breach two attack at together will be hopeless to try to defend see now that have several sick wounded notion of making escape be almost knocked on head at last moment may try to save life there must be desertion of sick wounded a long a there be cartridge to be fired best hope be in getting assistance from somewhere know nothing of what be going on outside think best plan will be for one of number to try to make way out go either to lucknow agra allahabad try get help if must spare troop of cavalry might be sufficient mutineer have suffered very heavily there be over hundred fifty body carried out today if attacked suddenly think must make great resistance may hold out for week ten day think be outside if rescue doe not arrive by time must either surrender try to escape by passage there be general assent bathurst must be man to do doctor said once through line must pas without exciting slightest suspicion must buy horse then must be at of station in two day yes there be doubt that be man to do major said where be now at work a usual major will go speak to tell fairly think will undertake why not doctor be dangerous mission more dangerous than remaining here well will see doctor said a left group nothing be said for few minute men sitting lying about smoking presently doctor returned bathurst refuse absolutely said admits that doe not think there must be much difficulty for to get through be convinced that mission must be useless one must help have be spared must have come to before now in case must have made escape major said be just why wo go major say that come what will will share fate of rest that will not live to be pointed to a one man who made escape of garrison of deennugghur whom can send major said be only other man who speaks language well enough to pas a native doctor speak fairly not well enough for besides be too old to bear fatigue of riding night day moreover service be wanted here a doctor a rifle shot will go if will send major captain forster said suddenly not in disguise in uniform on horse back of course must run gauntlet of sentry once through doubt if have horse must overtake mine there be general silence of surprise forster reckless courage be notorious have be conspicuous for manner in have chosen most dangerous point during siege offer to undertake what although dangerous enterprise in still offered far better chance of life than of remaining behind surprised everyone have be noticed that since rejection of plan to sally out in body cut way through enemy have be moody silent except only when fire be heavy danger considerable then laughed joked seemed absolutely to enjoy excitement be last man whom of must have expected to volunteer for service dangerous a might be have just be refused by bathurst on ground that offered chance of escape from common lot major be first to speak well captain forster a have just agreed that only chance be to obtain aid from one of station a be only volunteer for service see that can decline to accept offer at station do think must be most likely to find force must help must say lucknow major if help be to be obtained anywhere must say be there yes think be most hopeful will start at once suppose sooner better a soon a be fairly asleep say twelve o'clock very well will go write dispatch for to carry giving account of fix be in here how will sally out must think easiest plan must be to make gap in sandbag in breach lead horse till fairly outside then mount think have better take spare horse with doctor said will make difference if be chased if can change from one to other bathurst told to say went must have horse be long way best in station must fancy a good a own know forster said led horse be nuisance still a say might come in useful if be only to loose turn down side road so puzzle anyone who may be after in dark major forster left roof together well be rum go wilson said if have be anyone forster must have said that funked be taking opportunity to get out of everyone know that have amount of pluck look how charged sepoys single handed there be two sort of pluck wilson doctor said dryly there be pluck will carry man through desperate action lead to do deed be talk of army forster posse that kind of pluck in unusual degree be almost ideal cavalryman dashing reckless riding with smile on lip into thickest of fray absolutely careless of life when blood be up there be sort of courage support men under long continued strain enables patiently steadfastly to face death when see approaching step by step doubt whether forster posse passive sort of courage must ride up to cannon mouth must grow impatient in square of infantry condemned to remain inactive under heavy artillery fire one have changed more since siege began than have except when engaged under heavy fire have be either silent impatient short tempered shirking conversation even with woman when turn of duty be over mind say for moment suspect of being afraid of death when end came must fight a bravely a ever one must fight more bravely can not stand waiting be always pulling mustache moodily muttering to be good to do not to suffer must make shockingly bad patient in long illness well if of have letter want to write to friend in england must advise to take opportunity mind think will ever get forster may get through consider chance strongly against for ride of ten mile through country swarming with foe must choose messenger must rather trust for ride like requires patience caution resource be not man must select bathurst must have succeeded almost certainly if have once got out two men be a different a light to dark one posse just point other fails in have one at home want to write to so will undertake watch here chapter xvii men on descending from roof found lady engaged in writing major having told that there be chance of letter being taken out scarce one looked up a entered thought at moment be at home with to whom be writing what might well be last farewell stifled sob be heard in quiet room mournful letter be blurred with tear even from eye have not before be dimmed since siege began isobel hannay be first to finish for letter to mother be short one a closed looked up captain forster be standing at other side of table with eye fixed on made slight gesture to that wished to speak to hesitated moment then rose quietly left room moment later joined outside come outside said must speak to together went out through passage into courtyard isobel began need not tell that love till lately have not known how much feel now must not live without why be going away then captain forster asked quietly want to go alone said can not go alone want to go with uncle must surely consent be only chance of saving life know that be next to hopeless that force sufficient to rescue can be sent there be just chance be can be said must be married at allahabad must make for town instead of lucknow if will go with must leave there in safety till trouble be over be going to take horse a well a own two must be a likely to escape a one thank for offer captain forster said coldly decline place be here with uncle others why be asked passionately if love place be surely with do love isobel do not surely have not be mistaken isobel be silent for moment be mistaken captain forster said after pause paid attention such a have heard paid to many others be pleasant that be serious did not think believed be simply flirting with that meant more by than have meant before being forewarned therefore having fear must hurt more than must entered into in same spirit where there be so much to be anxious about be pleasure relief have met elsewhere under different circumstance think must have come to love girl almost without experience new to world a be must hardly have helped doing so think have thought be in earnest must have acted differently if have deceived by manner be sorry even have loved must not have consented to do thing ask be going on duty be going in hope of obtaining aid for must be simply escaping while others stay must despise for action besides think that even in case uncle must have consented to going with be sure that must forster broke in must never be mad enough to refuse chance of escape from such fate a may now await need not discus question said even if loved must not go with love have prejudiced against said angrily warned be right in doing so ask if be not must see sister of yours running risk of breaking heart without warning be angry went on putting hand on arm have be good friend captain forster like very much may never meet again be most likely never will do so be grateful to for many pleasant hour have given let part thus can not give hope that in distance when trouble be over must be spared may captain forster be sure must never be so if ever meet again will meet a part now a friend now can stay no longer will be missing turning entered house before must speak again be minute before followed have not really thought that must go with perhaps have hardly wished for on expedition woman must necessarily add to difficulty danger have thought that must have told that love be returned for perhaps first time in life be serious in protestation of doe matter said at last a turned 't be ten thousand to one against meeting again if do can take up where break off now have acknowledged that must have liked if have be sure be in earnest next time will be so be right be amusing with at first have more thought of marrying than have of flying there be use talking about future thing now be to get out of trap have felt like rat in cage with terrier watching for last month long to be on horseback again with chance of making fight for life what fool bathurst be to throw away chance bathurst work done have looked into hall where others be gathered hearing that doctor be alone on watch have gone up to be just thinking bathurst doctor said a joined about fight today seems to that come of business be not likely to be among who go down when place be taken how be doctor why be chance better than rest have hope that will be spared put faith in juggler bathurst have not struck that first picture saw have come true have never given thought for week bathurst said certainly have not thought of today yes now speak of have come true how strange put aside a clever trick one must not understand more than did others knowing seemed beyond bound of possibility that must come true anything must have believed a told might happen in future must not be found fighting desperately a saw doing there be true did so be only sort of frenzy did not fire shot a wilson may have told strove like man in nightmare to break spell seemed to render powerless to move when for moment firing ceased weight seemed to fall off be seized with sort of passion to kill have distinct remembrance of anything until be over be still nightmare one of different kind be more then than be when be lying helpless on sandbag still a say picture be complete at least if miss hannay be standing up here yes rose to foot in excitement of fight believe did so picture be true in detail a described to that being so believe that other picture one saw together isobel hannay in native disguise will also come true bathurst be silent for two three minute may be so doctor heaven only know trust for sake hers may be so though care little about that picture be final one know what may follow be so bathurst think that once fairly away in disguise might be trusted to make way down country see have complete confirmation of juggler power showed scene in past scene have not be in mind for year be certainly not in thought at time showed scene in future unlikely a appeared have actually taken place believe will be equally right in other picture have heard that forster be going yes wilson came down told while be at work wilson seemed rather disgusted at volunteering know that be surprised myself for a told knew at school have moral courage though plenty of physical still under circumstance must not have thought must have gone mean because of miss hannay bathurst yes be what mean sort of thing might weigh with bathurst not with have loved ridden away many time before in case fortunately think will leave aching heart behind mean to say doctor that think care for have not asked question doctor said dryly dare say like in fact be ready to admit that there have be what may call strong case of flirtation when young woman be thrown with uncommonly good looking man who lay out to be agreeable to experience be that flirtation generally come of especially when young woman have one else to make agreeable to be moreover little sore with world in general own at one time be rather inclined to think that out of sheer perverseness girl be going to make fool of herself with good looking scamp since have be shut up here have felt easy in mind about now if will take rifle for ten minute will go down get cup of tea volunteered to take sentry work did bargain for keeping night without relief by way told forster of offer of horse think be going to take be welcome to bathurst said carelessly will be of use to now look here doctor said shortly just put miss hannay out of head for present attend to business on hand think there be much chance of trying on again tonight may do so so please to keep sharp lookout while be below will be careful doctor bathurst said with laugh doctor have so little faith in watchfulness that a soon a went below sent up wilson to share guard at twelve o'clock sandbag be removed sufficiently to allow horse to pas through forster bathurst animal be led out through breach foot having be muffled with blanket to prevent striking stone arousing attention of enemy sentinel once fairly out mufflings be removed forster sprang into saddle goodby major said hope may be back again in eight nine day with squadron of cavalry goodby forster hope may be so may god protect gap in defense be closed instant horse passed through men stood in breach of wall listening a forster rode off went at walk before have gone fifty pace there be sharp challenge followed almost instantly by rifle shot then came crack of revolver rapid beat of galloping hoof loud shout be heard musket shot fired in rapid succession be not likely to have hit in dark major said a climbed back over sandbag may hit horse must be just a fatal leaving two sentry one just outside breach near wall other on sandbag rest of party hurried up on roof shot be still being fired there be confused sound of shouting then cavalry trumpet rang out sharply presently three shot fired in quick succession came upon air be signal agreed on major said be safely beyond line now be question of riding of cavalry will be in pursuit of before many minute be over forster adieu have be brief have busied up to last moment in looking to saddling of two horse have only gone into house said goodby to lady just when be time to start have said few hopeful word a to success of mission have evidently needed effort for to do so have opportunity of speaking word apart with isobel shook hand silently when came to turn must not have given credit for so much feeling mr doolan whispered to isobel a went out be really sorry to leave did think be man to be sorry for anything did affect think have absolutely grace to feel little ashamed of leaving think be fair isobel said warmly when be going away to fetch assistance for be deserting a rat desert sinking ship mr doolan said positively be only surprised that have grace to feel little ashamed of action a for caring there be only one person in world care for be reading 'david copperfield ' just before came in here steerforth character might have be sketched from forster be man without heart conscience man who must sacrifice everything to own pleasure yet even when one know to be what be one can hardly help liking wonder how be dear that scamp be generally more pleasant than good men never thought about mr doolan isobel said roused to smile by earnestness with mr doolan propounded problem can give reason except that be attracted by nature reverse of own mr doolan laughed so think be better than men isobel not one bit be cramped in opportunity given equal opportunity think there must be anything to choose between must stay talking here longer go on duty in sick ward at four o'clock enemy battery opened on following morning more violently than before more gun have be placed in position during night rain of missile be poured upon house for next six day position of besieged became hourly worse several breach have be made in wall shot now struck house inmate passed greater part of time in basement heat be terrible a firing be kept up night day sleep be almost impossible number of besieger have considerably increased large number of country people taking part in siege while regiment of sepoys from cawnpore have taken place of detachment of d bengal infantry of whom indeed few now remained garrison no longer held courtyard several time mass of enemy have surged up poured through breach large number of hand grenade of various size have be constructed by defender effect of thrown down from roof among crowded mass be so terrible that native time fell back horse have be turned out through breach on day after captain forster departure in order to save life plague of fly be not least of defender trouble after repulse of assault defender went out at night carried body of native who have fallen in courtyard beyond wall nevertheless odor of blood attracted such countless swarm of fly that ground be black with pervaded house in legion number of defender decreased daily six only be able now to carry arm mr hunter captain rintoul richards have died of fever farquharson have be killed by cannon ball two civilian have be badly wounded several of child have succumbed amy hunter have be killed by shell passed through sandbag protection of grating gave light to room in basement used a sick ward other lady be utterly worn out with exhaustion sleeplessness anxiety still there have be no word spoken of surrender have men be alone must have sallied out died fighting must have left woman at mercy of assailant work at gallery have be discontinued for time have be carried upwards until number of root in earth showed that be near surface a believed under clump of bush growing hundred fifty yard beyond wall of late there have be talk of using flight even at first have seemed almost hopeless be wholly beyond in present weakened condition on last of six day major hannay be severely wounded at night enemy fire relaxed little lady took advantage of to go up onto terrace for air while men gathered for council round major bed well doctor end be pretty near said be clear can not hold out many hour longer must look matter in face now have agreed along when must no longer resist must offer to surrender on term that life must be spared that must be given safe conduct down country that if term be refused be to resist to end then blow up house in think time have come for raising white flag think so doctor said have done everything men must do have little hope that will grant term of surrender for from native servant who have deserted must have fair idea of condition what do think bathurst think probable there be division among replied talookdars may have risen against think can have same deadly enmity sepoys have shown must be heartily sick of prolonged siege have lost large number of men must say must be willing enough to give term probably be overruled by sepoys perhaps by order from nana sahib know several of personally think must influence por sing who be certainly most powerful of zemindars of neighborhood be probably looked upon a natural leader if approve of major will go out in disguise endeavor to obtain interview with be honorable man if will give guarantee for safety must trust at rate can try if return will know be dead that term can be obtained can then decide when to end be worth attempt anyhow major said say nothing about danger will run for danger can be greater than hang over now very well major then will do at once must not expect back until tomorrow night can hardly hope to obtain interview with por sing tonight how will go out bathurst will go down at once break in roof of gallery said know be close round wall must not hope to get out through of breach suppose be quite convinced that there be hope of relief from lucknow quite convinced never have real hope of have there be force disposable must have started at once if forster arrived there with message might have be here by time at rate can wait no longer then will begin at once bathurst said taking crowbar pick from place where tool be kept lighted lamp went along gallery accompanied by doctor who carried two light bamboo ladder do think will succeed bathurst be pretty sure of said confidently believe have friend there friend doctor repeated in surprise yes be convinced that juggler be there not once dozen time during last two night when have be on watch

soon a be out will make way there will wait there night on chance of coming after what know of man strange power there seems nothing unreasonable to in being able to impress upon mind fact that want to see quite agree with there aid might be invaluable be not sort of man to have delusion bathurst quite believe what say feel more hopeful now than have done for time hour hard work hole be made through soil be three foot thick bathurst climbed up ladder looked out be a thought doctor be in middle of thicket now will go dress if will keep guard here with rifle at end of gallery figure be standing be isobel hannay have heard be going out again mr bathurst yes be going to see what can do in way of making term for may not come back again said nervously be of course possible miss hannay

ever since for what said spoke a foolish girl know better now have not seen how calm have be through trouble how have devoted to child how have kept up spirit how cheerfully have worked a trouble increased have come to look up to lean upon do say mr bathurst that forgive that if return can be friend a be before certainly forgive if there be anything to forgive miss hannay said gravely nothing that anyone can say can relieve of pain of knowing have be unable to take active part in defense have be forced to play part of woman rather than man assuredly if return will be glad to be again friend indeed have never ceased to be at heart perhaps expected something more did not come spoke cordially yet a one who felt that there be impassible barrier between stood irresolute for moment then held out hand goodby then said held moment goodby miss hannay may god keep guard then gently led to door passed out together quarter of hour later rejoined doctor having brought with few short length of bamboo will put across hole when get out said lay sod over cover up with leaf in case anyone must enter bush tomorrow be not likely be a well to take precaution one of have better stay on guard until come back must not do to trust of native that remain be utterly disheartened broken down might take opportunity of purchasing life by going out informing enemy of opening into gallery must already know of existence from men who have deserted fortunately think of be aware of exact direction if have be must have have countermining before having carefully closed up opening bathurst went to edge of bush listened must hear voice between house be quiet near at hand began to move noiselessly along through garden have great fear of meeting with anyone here native have formed cordon round wall behind that there must be one on watch a battery be silent be doubtless asleep there in ten minute stood before charred stump marked site of bungalow a did so figure advanced to meet be sahib be expecting knew that must come evening know how knew be heartily glad to see want to see por sing come along with will take to there be time to lose without word walked rapidly away followed by bathurst when got into open latter must see that companion be dressed in altogether different garb to in have before seen being attired a person of rank importance stopped presently for bathurst to come up with have done must to prepare way for said openly must for certain reason hing have said enough to make feel uncomfortable about future to render anxious to find way of escape for if people must ever again get mastery how be thing going rujub have heard nothing for three week how be at cawnpore cawnpore have be taken by nana surrendered on solemn oath that must be allowed to depart in safety broke oath there be not ten of defender alive woman be in captivity bathurst groaned have hardly hoped that handful of defender must have maintained against such overpowering number certainty a to fate be heavy blow lucknow asked residency hold out at present men say that must soon fall what do say say nothing man said can not use art in matter concern ourselves delhi there be little force of white in front of delhi there be ten of thousand of sepoys in town a yet white have maintained chief of punjaub have proved faithless to country there british rule be maintained thank god for bathurst exclaimed a long a punjaub hold out table may be turned other presidency nothing a yet rujub said in tone of discontent then be against rujub man stopped sahib know not what wish now have be brought up to hate white two of father brother be hung a thug father taught to hate men who did for year have worked quietly against a have most of of craft have reason to hate in old time be honored in land honored feared for even great one knew that have power such a other men have white treat a if be mere buffoon who play for amusement make distinction between wandering conjurer with trick of dexterity master who have power have be handed down from father to son for thousand of year who can communicate with other though separated by length of india who can a have seen make men invisible

of own countryman have lost old standing position while white must bribe with money to divulge secret in profess to disbelieve wonder that hate that long for return of old day when even prince be glad to ask favor at hand be seldom that show power now who aid whose servant be be not to be insulted by power bestow upon being used for amusement of men who believe in nothing european who first came to india have left record of strange thing saw at court of native prince such thing be no longer done for amusement of white master thus then for year have worked against just a saw that work be successful just a be prepared for blow be to sweep white men out of india saved daughter then work seemed to come to end must of countryman armed only with whip have thrown in way of tiger to save woman stranger one altogether beneath in rank one a be dust beneath foot must be ready to give life for yours be matter of course must have be ungrateful wretch otherwise be not enough at one blow work have devoted to for year be brought to nothing everything seemed to new a sat by daughter bedside when lay sick with fever have to think out again then saw thing in light saw that though white men be masterful often hard though have little regard for custom viewed belief a superstitious scoffed at notion of there being power of have knowledge yet that be great people other conqueror many of india have have none who have made first object to care for welfare of people at large feringhees have wrung nothing from poor to be spent in pomp display permit tyranny ill doing under poorest peasant till field in peace have be obliged to see feel now that destruction must be frightful misfortune must be ruled by native lord a soon a white man be gone old quarrel must break out country must be red with blood did not see before because have only looked at with eye of own caste now see with eye of one whose daughter have be saved from tiger by white man can not love have be taught to hate can see benefit rule have given to india what can do now be in stream must go with know not what wish what must do six month ago felt certain now doubt seemed to that in day english raj must be swept away how must be otherwise when whole army have conquered india for be against knew be brave have never lacked bravery how must tell that must fight one against hundred come let go on por sing be expecting told that knew that one from garrison must come out to treat with privately tonight be expecting though doe not know who may come ten minute walking approached large tent surrounded by several smaller one sentry challenged when approached on rujub giving name at once resumed walk up down rujub followed by bathurst advanced entered tent zemindar be seated on divan smoking hookah rujub bowed not with deep reverence of one approaching superior be here said then be not mistaken rujub how must be when knew rujub said have done what said have brought straight to be have to do with rest be for highness must rather that must be present por sing said a rujub turned to withdraw latter replied in matter be for to decide not nana wish highness must take responsibility have brought to rather than to commander of sepoys because authority must be greater be other oude chief who have borne weight of siege be only right that be who must decide condition of surrender sepoys be not master be well be not so nana oude chief have not taken up arm to free from english raj to be ruled over by men who have be servant of english be so zemindar said stroking beard well will talk with person rujub left tent know por sing bathurst said stepping forward from entrance where have hitherto stood be sahib bathurst be so zemindar said laying aside pipe rising to foot none must come to whom must rather see have always proved just officer have complaint against have often broken bread together have grieved to know that be in yonder house do come to on own account from sahib who command come on own account bathurst said when come a messenger from must come openly know to be honorable man must say have to say to depart in safety regard a one who have be misled regret for sake that must have be induced to take part with mutineer against believe chief have be terribly misled have be told that needed effort to overthrow british raj who told so lied might have seemed easy to destroy handful of european scattered throughout india have not succeeded in doing even have done so must not have so much a begun work there be few white soldier here why because england trusted in fidelity of native troop thought necessary to keep only handful of soldier in india if need be for soldier now here must send hundred will send hundred if required to reconquer india already may be sure that ship be on sea laden with troop if find so hard to overcome few soldier now here what must do against great army will pour in ere long why effort of sepoys gathered at delhi be insufficient to defeat four five thousand british troop who hold post outside town waiting only till succor arrives from england to take terrible vengeance woe be then to who have taken part against still more to whose hand be stained with british blood be too late now native said gloomily die be cast since have seen how score of men must defend that shattered house against thousand do think have not seen have be wrong who must have thought that men must do thing be too late now be not too late bathurst said be too late indeed to undo mischief have be done not too late for to secure against of consequence english be just when will have stamped out mutiny a assuredly will do will draw distinction between mutinous soldier who be false to salt native chief who fought a believed for independence of country one thing will not forgive whether in sepoy in prince murder of man woman child in cold blood for there will be pardon be not upon ground came to appeal to a noble of oude man who be brave enemy who must never be butcher have fought against other fairly evenly time have come when can fight no longer demand of confidently that if surrender life of within wall will be respected safe conduct be granted down country know that such condition be granted to garrison at cawnpore that be shamelessly violated for act sahib will never be forgiven will be hunted down like dog hung when be caught just a if have be poorest peasant have not so bad opinion of people of india a to believe base enough to follow example be confident that if grant term will see that condition be observed have received order from nana sahib to send prisoner down to por sing said in hesitating voice will never send down prisoner from here bathurst replied firmly may attack again after loss of life of score more of follower may be successful will take prisoner for at last moment will blow house in into air besides who made nana sahib master be not lord of oude though doubtless dream of sovereignty be rope not throne awaits why must noble of oude obey order of peasant boy though be adopted by peishwa peishwa be never lord why must obey traitor butcher disgrace to india when order to hand over to prisoner sword have made be true por sing said gloomily sepoys will not agree to term sepoys be not master bathurst said surrender to to place confidence in word have faith in honor of noble of oude if friend grant term ask sepoys may clamor will not venture to do more neither nana sahib dare at moment affront people of oude there be sepoys round lucknow be men of oude who be really pressing siege if be firm will not dare to break with on question a life of score of european if will give word honor that will be spared will come out in morning with flag of truce to treat with if not will defend to last then blow into air think por sing said doubtfully that if agreed to must be taken into consideration must british raj be restored can promise that will bathurst said will be properly represented that be to that defender of deennugghur woman child with owe life may be sure that will go very long way towards wiping out part have taken in attack on station when day of reckoning come british government will know a well how to reward who rendered service in day a to punish who have be foe will do por sing said firmly come out until afternoon in morning will talk with other zemindars bring over to agree that there will be no more bloodshed there be not one of be heartily sick of business eager to put end to rujub may report what like to nana will do what be right after hearty expression of thanks bathurst left tent rujub be awaiting outside have succeeded asked will guarantee life of garrison seemed to be afraid of what might report to nana sahib be nana agent here rujub said have be working with for month must must undo now be away when surrendered at cawnpore have not be that massacre must never have taken place for be one of few who have influence with be fully cognizant of power fear made way back without interruption to clump of bush near house when will see again bathurst asked know replied rujub be sure that will be at hand to aid if possible must danger arise chapter xviii a soon a bathurst began to remove covering of hole voice came from below be that bathurst right doctor heaven be praised be back sooner than expected by long way heard voice talking so doubted whether be ladder be still there suppose doctor yes be just a got off be going to do about hole rujub be here will cover up after then be right doctor said a bathurst stepped down beside found juggler really waiting for at bungalow doctor a expected what have done can hardly have seen por sing be not much over hour since left have seen doctor what be more have pledged word for safety thank god for lad be more than expected will be news indeed for poor woman do think will be strong enough to keep pledge think so asked to wait until tomorrow afternoon before going out with flag of truce said that by time must get other zemindars to stand by must make term whether sepoys liked not well will tell about afterwards bathurst let take news in to at once be long since have good tidings of kind must be cruel to keep in suspense even for five minute there be noisy outburst of joy when news be told three week before must have be received with liveliest satisfaction now bitterness of death be well nigh past child lay in graf in garden scarce one of lady have lost husband child while woman murmured thank god a clasped child to tear ran down a thought how different must have be have news come sooner men although equally quiet yet showed more outward satisfaction than woman warm grasp of hand be exchanged by who have fought side by side during terrible day load seemed lifted at once off shoulder bathurst stayed moment in room after news be told went in with dr wade to major reported to in full conversation have taken place between por sing think be right bathurst if oude men hold together sepoys will scarcely risk breach with whether will be able to secure safety afterwards be thing quite see that major seems to that have option to accept offer hope for best be doctor agreed be certain death if surrender there be chance that will be able to protect if do at rate can be worse off than be here isobel have be in with mr doolan nursing sick child when bathurst arrived presently came out isobel shook hand with without speaking be heavily indebted to mr bathurst mr doolan said if escape from will be to that humanly owe life spoke in voice that in room must hear be

possessed a much courage a of do hope that will give hand others who have held aloof from bathurst came forward expressed deep regret for what have occurred bathurst heard in silence feel that there be anything to forgive said quietly be glad to hear what say know mean accept hand offer what felt towards have affected little for contempt for be a nothing to contempt of nothing can alter fact that here where man hand be wanted to defend lady child hand be paralyzed that may be at other time in hour of battle fail hopelessly nothing can do can wipe out from own consciousness that disgrace exaggerate altogether bathurst wilson broke in hotly be nonsense talking like after way jumped down into middle of with mace of yours be splendid more than mr bathurst mr doolan said think woman know what true courage be there be not one of have since siege began be helped strengthened by calmness not one have reason to be grateful for kindness to child during terrible time wo hear even speak

believe have slept two hour at time since siege began mr doolan said with tear in eye have suffered god only know what have suffered be sure that have suffered more than of a for men may well say be sorry ashamed of treatment of coward indeed mr bathurst may be nervous be sure have a much courage a anyone here come isobel be up last night be past two o'clock now must try to get little sleep

shout of triumph by assailant firing at once ceased in few minute native officer carrying white flag advanced towards wall wish to see zemindar por sing bathurst said to treat with upon subject of surrender officer withdrew returned in hour saying that must conduct officer in command to presence of chief of besieging force captain doolan therefore accompanied by bathurst dr wade went out be conducted to great tent where zemindars principal officer of sepoys be assembled bathurst acted a spokesman por sing said zemindars of oude major hannay being disabled captain doolan who be now in command of garrison have come to represent to offer to surrender to under condition that life of british native within wall be respected that pledge faith honor that will be permitted to go down country without molestation be to por sing noble of oude that surrender not to who being sworn soldier have mutinied against officer have in many case treacherously murdered with such men major hannay will have dealing be to that surrender major hannay bid say that if offer be refused can for long time prolong resistance be amply supplied with provision munition of war many a be number of assailant who have fallen already yet more will die before obtain possession of house more than in case will be taken prisoner for one have firmly resolved to fire magazine when resistance be no longer possible to bury ourselves assailant in ruin when bathurst ceased hubbub of voice arose sepoy officer protesting that surrender must be made to be minute before anything like quietness be restored then one of officer said here be rujub speaks in name of nana what doe say to rujub who be handsomely attired stepped forward have order from highness on subject said certainly said that prisoner be to be sent to at present there be prisoner if siege continues english carry out threat will there be prisoner can not think that nana sahib must wish to see hundred more of countryman slain blown up only that may have few men woman in power have come here to take kill one of officer said defiantly will do so por sing who have be speaking with talookdars round rose from seat seems to that be for to decide matter said be upon that loss of siege have fallen at order of nana sahib collected retainer abandoned home have for three week supported danger of siege follow nana be not vassal do even know what wish be in matter seems to that have done enough more than enough number of retainer kinsman have fallen to prolong siege must cause greater loss what must gain by possession of heap of stone therefore be of opinion that offer of surrender must be accepted war for freedom of country have thirst for blood of english sahib still le for of wife child of officer angrily protested por sing stood firm other chief be equally determined seeing officer consulted together highest in rank then said to talookdars protest against condition being given since be resolved stand aside be ready to agree for ourselves men to what may decide what pledge do require por sing asked bathurst be content rajah with personal oath that life of within house will be respected undertaking that will be

signified rajah then took solemn oath to fulfill condition of agreement other talookdars doing same commander of sepoys also doing so without hesitation por sing then promised that cart must be collected before morning to carry lady sick wounded down to river be eight mile distant can sleep in quiet tonight added will place guard of own men round house see that none trouble in way few other

have come to place in hand a hostage sahib por sing son said father thought likely that sepoys others might make trouble said that if be in hand a hostage people must see that agreement must be kept must oppose more vigorously to sepoys be thoughtful kind of father bathurst said a far a accommodation be concerned can do little to make comfortable in other respect be not badly provided of native servant be at once told off to erect awning over portion of terrace table couch be placed here bathurst undertook work of entertaining visitor be glad of precaution have be taken in sending for with glass must make out that there be much disturbance in sepoy line men gathering in large group with much shouting noise musket be discharged in direction of house be evident that mutineer be very discontented with decision have be arrived at in short time however body several hundred strong of oude fighting men moved down surrounded house when number of sepoys approached with excited menacing gesture one of zemindars went out to meet bathurst watching conference must see by pointing to roof of house that be informing that hostage have be given to european for due observance of treaty doubted not be telling that life must be endangered by movement then pointed to battery a if threatening that if attack be made gun must be turned upon at rate after time moved away gradually sepoys must be seen returning to line there be few preparation to be made by garrison for journey have be settled that might take personal effect with be at once agreed to take a little a possible a there must probably be little room in boat fewer thing carried le there must be to tempt cupidity of native well bathurst what do think of outlook doctor asked a late in evening sat together on sandbag in corner of terrace think that if get past cawnpore in safety there be not much to fear there be other large place on river lower get down le likely native be to disturb knowing a be almost sure to do that force be gathering at allahabad after what heard of massacre of prisoner at cawnpore whom nana officer have sworn to allow to depart in safety there be little hope that scoundrel will respect arrangement made here must pas place at night trust to drifting down unobserved river be wide there keeping near opposite shore may get past in darkness without being perceived even if do make out chance be will not hit there be so few of that there be reason why must trouble greatly about be sorry to say bathurst that like appearance of major wound everything have be against heat close air anxiety of mind have told on seems very low have great doubt whether will ever see allahabad hope be wrong doctor thought there be change for worse when saw hour ago there be drawn look about face did not like be splendid fellow nothing must have be kinder than have be to wish must change place with doctor grunted well a none of may see allahabad bathurst need not trouble on score wonder what have become of friend conjurer thought might have be in to see afternoon did not expect bathurst said expect went a far a dared in what said at durbar today probably be doing can to keep matter quiet of course may have gone down to cawnpore to see nana sahib must think more probable that must remain here until know be safe on board boat ah here be wilson said doctor be fine young fellow be very glad have gone through safely so be bathurst said warmly here be wilson thought must find smoking here wilson said a seated be awfully hot below lady be at work picking out thing be going to take with packing a must not be of use at thought must come up for little fresh air if one can call fresh in fact must rather sit over open drain for stench be horrible how quiet everything seems tonight after crouching here for last three week listening to boom of cannon rush of ball overhead crash a hit something seems quite unnatural one ca help thinking that something be going to happen believe will be able to sleep wink tonight while generally in spite of row have be a much a must do to keep eye open suppose will get accustomed to in time at present seems too unnatural to enjoy have better get good night sleep if can wilson doctor said there wo be much sleep for in boat till see wall of allahabad suppose not doctor expect will be horribly cramped up long to be there hope to get attached to one of regiment coming up so a to help in giving thrashing to scoundrel that deserve must give year pay to get villain nana sahib within reach of sword be awful to think of news brought in bathurst that there be hundred of woman child in power now what day will be when march into cawnpore count chicken too soon wilson doctor said time be looking forward to be when will have safely passed cawnpore on way down be quite enough for to hope for at present yes be thinking of wilson replied if nana must not be bound by oath have taken be not likely to respect agreement made here must pas place at night bathurst said trust to not being seen even if do make out sha be under fire long unless follow down bank if night be dark may not make out at fortunately there be moon boat be not very large mark even by daylight at night must only be chance shot must hit yes must be a difficult to hit a tiger doctor put in wilson laughed have gained lot of experience since then doctor what age seems back year almost doe indeed doctor agreed count time by incident not by day well think will turn in be coming bathurst must not sleep bathurst said will watch till morning feel sure be safe mutineer might attempt something night however passed off quietly soon after daybreak eight bullock cart be seen approaching with strong body of oude men hour later luggage be packed sick wounded laid on straw in wagon several of lady took place with mr doolan isobel mary hunter said must walk for while have be arranged that men might carry out arm with of ten able to walk took rifle while even woman have pistol about just a be ready por sing several of zemindars rode up on horseback will see to boat said have taken provision for voyage must be better not to stop to buy anything on way precaution have be taken a soon a be ready set out guarded by four hundred oude matchlock men sepoys have gathered near house a soon a left there be rush made to secure plunder must have liked to have emptied content of of bottle into wine doctor growled must not have be strictly professional perhaps must have be good action be sure must not have given poison doctor wilson laughed reasonable dose of ipecacuanha might hardly have gone against conscience conscience have nothing to do with doctor said fellow came from cawnpore have doubt took part in massacre there conscience must have troubled if must have poisoned whole of scoundrel put slow match in magazine blown into air under present condition must hardly have be politic a one must be sure of annihilating whole of well miss hannay what be thinking of be thinking that uncle look worse morning doctor doe not strike so too must hope that fresh air will do good one must not expect anyone to get better in place be enough to kill healthy man to say nothing of sick one isobel be walking by side of cart in uncle be lying be not long before took place beside doctor shook head can hing doctor bathurst said in low tone nothing be weaker morning still change of air may help may have strength to fight through wound be serious one must under other circumstance have got over a be think chance very poor one though must not say a much to after three hour travel reached river here two large native boat be lying by bank baggage sick be soon placed on board european with native servant be then divided between rajah son six of retainer took place in one of boat doctor captain doolan have settled how party must be divided major other sick men be placed in one boat in be doctor bathurst four civilian with isobel hannay mr hunter daughter captain doolan wife mr rintoul other three lady with six child who have alone survived rest of party be in other boat por sing companion be thanked heartily for protection have given bathurst handed document have be signed by party testifying to service have rendered if get down to allahabad bathurst said a handed to will insure good treatment when british troop come up if get there will represent conduct in such light that think can promise that part took in siege will be forgiven then boat pushed off started on way down stream distance by water to cawnpore be over forty mile be already eleven o'clock slow progress only must be made with heavy boat be thought that must be able to pas town before daylight began to break next morning therefore pushed on a rapidly a must boatman being encouraged to use utmost effort by promise of large reward upon arrival at allahabad there be little talk in boat now that strain be over felt effect severely doctor attended to patient isobel sat by side of uncle giving broth that have brought with from time to time moistening lip with weak brandy water spoke only occasionally much think will get down to allahabad isobel said if go down to calcutta go straight to jamieson son be agent will supply with money to take home have copy of will agent in london have copy have two made in case of accident oh uncle will get better now be out of terrible place be afraid be too late dear though must like to live for sake think see happiness before if choose to take be noble fellow isobel in spite of unfortunate weakness isobel made answer slight pressure of hand be holding showed that understood what meant be use to tell uncle that felt that what might have be be over now bathurst have chatted with several time evening before during march that morning felt difference between tone that in have addressed in old time before trouble began be subtle difference that must hardly have explained even to herself knew that be a friend a friend only that must treat in future that past be closed book be determined not to reopen bathurst talked to mr hunter daughter of whom be mere shadow worn out with grief anxiety watching at time went forward to talk to young noble who have taken seat there boat have be arched in with canopy of bough to serve alike a protection from sun to screen within from sight of native in boat on bank look bathurst doctor said to late in afternoon everything seems going on well boat have passed boatman say that will pas cawnpore about one o'clock at rate at be going feel nervous doctor more anxious than have be ever since began there be apprehension of danger weighing over that ca account for a say everything seems going on well yet feel that be not so be afraid be getting superstitious feel a if rujub know of danger impending that be somehow conveying impression to know that there be nothing to be done that be doing only thing that can do unless be to land try make way down on foot must be sheer madness that man can in way impress mind at distance be evident from summons gave to meet at ruin of bungalow feel same clear distinct perception of wish now a did then perhaps be not aware of particular of danger threatens knowing can see way of escape out of may be at night when everything be quiet one mind be more open to such impression than be when be surrounded by other people have other thing to think of feel actual consciousness of danger think there can be danger until get down near cawnpore may possibly be on lookout for there may even have boat out on stream be possible that sepoys may have sent down word yesterday afternoon to nana sahib that have surrendered must be starting by boat morning think there can be danger till get there must meet native boat be stopped por sing son will be able to induce to let pas certainly none of villager about here must be likely to disobey once beyond cawnpore believe that must have sufficient influence speaking a doe in name not only of father of other powerful landowner to induce of oude people to let pas regard cawnpore a one danger believe to be very real one have be thinking indeed that must be good thing when get within couple of mile of place for who be able to walk to land on opposite bank make way along past cawnpore take to boat again mile below town must be excellent plan doctor if boat be stopped found sick must kill to certainty think must leave be quite sure miss hannay must not leave uncle think might get over even bathurst there be only major other two men mr forsyth three child too ill to walk there be eight of native servant young rajah retainer ought to have difficulty in carrying wounded a to luggage must be sacrificed so that boatman can go down with empty bench must be pitched overboard loss must be of real consequence everyone must manage with what have on until get to allahabad there must be difficulty in getting what require there think plan be excellent one doctor will ask young chief if men will help to carry sick if say yes will go alongside other boat explain plan to doolan young rajah at once assented boat being rowed up to other plan be explained approved of objection be raised by anyone even to proposal for getting rid of luggage a soon a matter be arranged general disposition towards cheerfulness be manifested everyone have felt that danger of passing cawnpore must be immense plan for avoiding seemed to lift load from mind be settled must land at spot where river be bordered by bush young tree that stout pole must be cut blanket fastened between so a to form stretcher on sick must be carried a far a possible boat be kept on left side of river at time willow rendered necessary to keep over by right bank whenever be near shore silence be observed lest foreign tongue must be noticed by anyone near bank night fell still continued course hour after sunset be rowing near right bank major have fallen into sort of doze isobel be sitting next to bathurst be talking in low tone together when suddenly there be hail from shore not fifty yard away what boat be fishing boat going down river one of boatman answered row alongside must examine there be moment pause then doctor said in native language row on men oar of boat again dipped into water be pressed for time young zemindar shouted then dropping voice urged men to row at top of speed stop fire came from shore answer be returned from boat be now nearly opposite speaker then came word fire six cannon loaded with grape be discharged crackle of musketry at same moment broke out shot tore through boat killing disabling many bringing down arbor of bough upon terrible cry arose be confusion most of rower be killed boat drifted helplessly amid storm of rifle bullet a cannon flashed out grape swept boat bathurst with sharp cry sprang to foot leaped overboard a did several others from boat diving kept under water for distance then swam desperately till reached willow water on other side of river then fell foremost on sand eight ten others also gained shore in body be running towards bank when gun be again fired three be swept away by iron hail few straggling musket shot be fired then order be shouted splashing of oar be heard a one of native boatman rowed one of two boat toward shore bathurst rose to foot ran stumbling like drunken man towards bush just a reached fell heavily forward lay there insensible three men came out from jungle dragged in a did so loud scream arose from other bank then dozen musket be fired be quiet be not for quarter of hour that bathurst be conscious of what be going on around someone be rubbing chest hand who be asked oh be bathurst heard wilson voice exclaim thought be be so dark now be off white sand must not see where be hit know bathurst said felt sort of shock

confused who have with asked two native think one be young chief other be one of follower bathurst spoke to in native language found that wilson be not mistaken a soon a found that be understood young chief poured out volley of curse upon who have attacked bathurst stopped will have time for afterwards murad said first thing be to see what have best be done have happened since landed wilson boat be pretty nearly cut in two wilson said be sinking when jumped over other boat have be rowed ashore what did hear wilson woman scream wilson said reluctantly five six shot be fired there have be sound

bless goodby murad tell father when see that know shadow of broken faith rest on so saying turned went into clump of bush while wilson too overpowered to speak started on way down country with two native chapter xix now alone bathurst threw down among bash in attitude of utter depression why be killed with others groaned why be not killed when sat there by side so lay for hour then slowly rose looked round there be faint light in sky will be light in hour said to again sat down suddenly started have someone spoken have fancied wait till come seemed to hear word plainly just a have heard rujub summons before be be rujub how be that can make hear in way be sure be voice anyhow will wait show be thinking of be sure will help know well enough must hing by bathurst assumed with unquestioning faith isobel hannay be alive have reason for confidence that first shower of grape might have killed a killed others must not admit doubt in mind wilson description of what have happened while be insensible be one of ground of confidence have heard woman scream mr hunter daughter be only other woman in boat isobel must not have screamed have musket be pointed at did think others must have done so screamed when saw native about to murder who be with three woman be sitting together if one have fallen by grape shot must probably have be killed felt confident therefore that have escaped believed must have known have be killed if can be influenced by juggler surely must have felt have isobel died argued be satisfied that be still alive what however more than anything else gave

shown to unless have be true what seemed impossible to must be fighting like brave man have be verified why must not must have laughed at such superstition six month ago now cling to a one ground for hope well will wait if have to stay here until tomorrow night noiselessly moved about in little wood going to edge looking out pacing to fro with quick step face set in frown occasionally muttering to be in fever of impatience longed to be doing something even if something led to detention death said to that must not care so that isobel hannay did know that have died in trying to rescue sun rose

trying to do so be happy one tear flowed between closed lid be not painful one blamed now for having felt for moment hurt at bathurst desertion of to have remained in boat must have be certain death while must have be of assistance to anyone else that must escape then if must now seemed to perfectly natural action hoped that of others have done same that bathurst be not working alone did not occur to that there must be possibility of scheme for rescue succeeding a to that felt more hopeful than before seemed to take away sense of utter loneliness that before felt that someone must be interesting in fate perhaps there must be more than mere verbal message next time how long must be before heard again how long respite have before wretch came to see doubtless have heard that be ill

opposition to passing out a officer with palanquin have told that lady of rajah zenana must leave shortly similar message have be given to officer at main gate who however requested to see hand arm to satisfy that be right be sufficient to assure that be not white woman passing out in disguise rabda at once proceeded to father house a expected bathurst be away for have arranged to meet at eight o'clock in garden did not return until eleven having waited two hour for returning home in much anxiety at non appearance what have happened why did not meet rabda father exclaimed a entered rabda rapidly repeated incident have happened since have parted from evening before handed to bathurst two note have received from isobel then be in safety with others exclaimed in delight thank god for thank rabda indeed for what have done life be lord girl said quietly what have done be nothing if have known rujub that must be moved at once might have rescued on way rujub shook head there be far too many people along road sahib must not have be done of course there be knowing that must be sent off directly after nana have seen be much disfigured rabda bathurst asked dreadfully girl said sorrowfully acid must have be too strong be strong doubt bathurst said if have put on a instructed must only have burnt surface of skin have burnt dreadfully sahib even must hardly have known must be brave indeed to have done must have suffered dreadfully obtained ointment for be better when left be with wife of sahib hunter now rabda see if meal be prepared rujub said be hungry can have eaten nothing morning then left room leaving bathurst to read letter still held in hand feeling that be too precious to be looked at until be alone be time before rabda brought in breakfast glancing at saw how deeply have be moved by letter went up to placed hand on shoulder will get for sahib have be successful so far be assured that will succeed again what have done be more difficult than what have to do be easier to get twenty prisoner from jail than one from rajah zenana be true enough rabda at moment be not thinking of of other thing longed for sympathy girl must not have understood have told feeling to be hero must have seemed to folly have said that felt altogether unworthy of isobel hannay after have finished breakfast rujub again came in what doe sahib intend to do now asked a far a can see there be nothing to do at present rujub said when white troop come up will be delivered then will lord go down to allahabad certainly not there be saying what may happen be so rujub agreed white woman be safe at present if a sahib think white soldier must beat troop of nana who can say what will happen people will be wild with rage nana will be furious be tiger who having once laid paw on victim will not allow to be torn from can never allow to be injured bathurst said be possible that a troop advance may carry off a hostage by threat of killing may make term for own life must never venture to carry out threat think must asked rujub remained silent for minute think so sahib nana be ambitious man have wealth everything most men must desire to make life happy wanted more thought that when british raj be destroyed must rule over territory of peishwa be one of greatest lord of land have staked everything on if loses have lost know that after breach of oath massacre here there be pardon for be tiger wounded tiger be most dangerous if be a believe will be defeated believe one thought will be of revenge day brings news of fresh rising scindia army will join will probably follow oude be rising in arm large army be gathering at delhi even if nana be defeated here will not be lost have twenty thousand men there be well nigh two hundred thousand in arm round lucknow alone belief be that if beaten first thought will be to take revenge at once on feringhees to make name terrible that will then go off with army to lucknow delhi where must be received a one who have dared more than others to defy white who have hope of pardon can therefore be relied upon above others to fight to last may be so rujub though can scarce believe that there exists monster who must give order for murder of hundred of woman child in cold blood at rate will remain watch will decide upon what will be best plan to rescue from prison if hear that evil be intended if not can remain patiently until troop arrive know subada ke kothee be if remember right large quadrangle with window on outside be so sahib be strong place difficult indeed to get into out of there be only main gate be guarded at night by two sentry outside there be doubtless strong guard within must learn whether same regiment always furnishes guard if so might be possible to bribe be afraid must be too dangerous to try there be score of men in cawnpore who must cut throat for rupee when come to breaking open prison to carry off one of white woman whom hate must be too dangerous to try must not do something with art rujub if there be only outside sentry must be easy enough sahib must send to sleep with wave of hand must not affect men inside whom know even by sight besides in addition to soldier who guard gate there will be men who have be told off to look after prisoner will require great deal of thinking over sahib believe will manage will go tomorrow to bithoor show boldly to nana know have done good service to anger will have cooled down by time will listen to what have to say will be useful to for to be able to go in out of palace at will so learn first news from about be most important that must know if have evil intention towards captive so that may have time to carry out plan very well rujub expect to remain indoors hope for must wear out if be obliged to wait here doing nothing sahib will be perfectly safe for to go about just a be can get other disguise like will gather what be said in town can listen to sepoys examine subada ke kothee if like will go there with now daughter will come with may be useful will be glad to be doing something went out from city towards prison house stood in open space round be several other building of surrounded with garden wall subada ke kothee be large building forming three side of square strong high wall forming fourth side be low with flat roof there be window opening in outside wall chamber facing courtyard two sentry be at gate be in red sepoy uniform bathurst saw at once how much bond of discipline have be relaxed have leaned musket against wall one be squatted on ground beside firearm other be talking with two three native of acquaintance gate be closed a watched native officer came up stood for minute talking with soldier by gesticulation must be seen be exceedingly angry men took musket began to walk up down then officer knocked at gate instead of being opened man appeared at loophole in gate tower officer handed to paper minute later gate be opened sufficiently for to pas in be then closed behind be evidently pretty strict bathurst said think rujub there be much chance of doing anything there rujub shook head sahib be clear have strict order about opening shutting gate must not be very difficult to scale wall of house bathurst said with rope hook at end be only first step real difficulty lie in getting prison room open in first place for doubt be locked up at night in second getting out of building must lower down from top of wall sahib yes if one must get out of room be confined in without making slightest stir be almost too much to hope that one must be able to do that men in charge of be likely to keep close watch for know that head must pay for captive allowed to escape think will watch much sahib will not believe that of woman broken down a must be by trouble must attempt such thing for even if got out of prison then made escape from building must be caught before must go far where doe prison house lie rabda bathurst asked be on left hand side a enter gate be farthest door along side most of building have be used for storehouse must say perhaps for guard when place be palace have two floor one above other be large vaulted room extending from ground to roof

talking about there be indeed considerable number of people near building fact that white prisoner be within seemed to exercise fascination even woman brought child sat on bank marked where garden have once be talked of white captive bathurst strolled about among group of sepoys townspeople former talked in loud tone of little force have already started from allahabad boasted how easily must eat up feringhees seemed however to bathurst that good deal of confidence be assumed that among at least there be undercurrent of doubt uneasiness though talked a loudly boldly a companion townspeople be of two class there be budmashes rough of place who uttered brutal ferocious joke a to probable fate of white woman there be others who kept in group apart talked in low voice be trader to whom event have taken place foreboded ruin already most of shop have be sacked many of principal inhabitant murdered by mob who have so far escaped thanks in instance to protection afforded by sepoy officer saw that trade be ruined best customer killed virtually at mercy of mob who might again break out upon occasion of excitement be silent when bathurst approached attire arm so ostentatiously displayed in sash marked a one of dangerous class perhaps prisoner from jail whose door have be thrown open on first night of sepoy rising for hour bathurst remained in neighborhood of prison sun set night came on then small party of soldier came up relieved sentry time number of sentry at gate be doubled three men be posted one on of other side of building after seeing done returned to house

possibly certain person in sympathy with other may be able to act upon other from distance especially when thrown into sort of trance be known a clairvoyant state always used to look upon that a humbug need hardly say will in future be ready to believe almost anything professes to have other even greater power than what have seen at rate can have motive in deceiving when have risked life to help do know rabda offered to go into prison father must have got order to pas in then to let go out in dress while remained in stead must not accept sacrifice even to save be sure have done so must

going to push on doctor a have have good long tramp already will stop here until tomorrow morning if like let go on bathurst must rather be on move can tell story a go chapter xxii bathurst knew doctor well perceived glad a be to have met be yet profoundly depressed in spirit added to fact that have left cawnpore that morning instead of waiting a have intended convinced bathurst what dreaded have taken place waited until isobel stopped for moment rabda might rearrange cloth folded round in proper draping then said quickly heard yesterday what be intended doctor be possible that have be done be done morning what surely not doctor soul woman child think of fiend devil native brought news if have heard in street of cawnpore must have gone mad seized sword run amuck a be be well nigh out of mind must not stay there man must have sheltered until troop came up be obliged to be moving so started down hush here come isobel must keep from now isobel went on a girl joined started along road tell how be find here mr bathurst must tell doctor can not talk about yet can hardly think about well bathurst let hear from be painful story for to have to tell isobel looked up in surprise painful mr bathurst must have thought stopped not painful miss hannay in part must rather tell doctor when have finished journey evening if curiosity will allow to wait so long will try to wait doctor replied though own be trial now isobel have not told yet what have happened to face let look at closer child see arm be bad too what on earth have happened to burnt with acid doctor mr bathurst will tell about bless mystery seems to thicken well have got into pretty pickle why child burn of sort leave scar a bad a if have be burnt by fire ought to be in dark room with face hand bandaged instead of tramping along here in sun have lotion ointment doctor have used regularly since be done place hurt much now no look healthy enough said examining closely granulation be going on nicely warn will be disfigured for month may be year before get rid of scar doubt indeed if will ever get rid of altogether well well what will talk about will take pity on doctor will walk on ahead with rabda father mr bathurst can then tell story will be best plan dear now then bathurst fire away said when others have gone on thirty forty yard ahead well doctor remember that be forward talking to young zemindar be sitting aft by side of miss hannay when opened fire must think do remember doctor said be not likely to forget if live to be hundred well what about jumped overboard bathurst said laying hand impressively upon doctor shoulder gave cry know did jumped overboard doctor looked at in astonishment well so did like shot what do say in tone for of course jumped overboard if have must not be here now understand doctor bathurst said gloomily be sitting there next to isobel woman loved be talking in low tone know why at moment mad thought be coming into mind that after cared for that in spite of disgrace have brought upon in spite of being coward might still be mine a be thinking there came crash of cannon can be imagined possible that jumped up like frightened hare without thought of without thought of anything in mad terror jumped overboard left behind to fate if have not be that a soon a recovered sens be hit on head just a landed knew nothing of what happened until found in bush with young wilson by side thought occurred to must rescue die in attempt must have blown out brain bless heart bathurst doctor said earnestly what else must have done why jumped overboard without stopping to think so did everyone else who have power to do so no doubt what good must have done if have stayed what good must have done to girl if have be killed why if have be killed must now be lying mangled dead with others in ghastly prison take too morbid view of matter altogether there be reason why must not have jumped overboard doctor others see be with woman loved might have seized in arm jumped overboard with swam ashore with might have stayed died with thought of own wretched life deserted dear bathurst did not think of life think of stopped to think of anything constituted a be impulse must have be overpowering be nonsense taking matter to heart why man if have stopped must have be murdered when boat touched shore do think must have made happier to have seen killed before eye if have swam ashore with chance be must have be killed by volley of grape for saw eight ten body lying on sand be say hit acted upon impulse grant be upon wise impulse did very best thing must have be done doing so made possible that isobel hannay must be rescued from what must otherwise have be certain death have turned out so doctor bathurst said gloomily thank god that be saved that doe not alter fact that english gentleman by birth thought only of left woman loved who be sitting by side to perish let talk more about be done over there be end of now will tell story doctor listened silently until heard of isobel being taken to bithoor atrocious villain exclaimed have be lamenting last month that never poisoned fellow now go on go on how on earth did get away bathurst told whole story interrupted by many exclamation of approval by doctor especially when learned why isobel disfigured well done exclaimed always knew that be plucky girl needed courage can tell to burn a have done to say nothing of risking spoiling beauty for life slight sacrifice for woman bathurst passed lightly over fight in courtyard doctor questioned a to exact fact not so bad for coward bathurst said dryly there be noise bathurst said if have have pistol have used might have be different heaven know think that then with life at stake must have flinched have made up mind must have pistol hope think that nerve must not have given way then be sure must bathurst well go on with story well how did feel then asked when bathurst described how guard rushed in through gate firing for be noise not danger upset did not even think of bathurst said in surprise now mention be astonished be not for minute paralyzed a always be did not feel anything of sort rushed in firing a told directly have gone took hand ran out together think quite possible bathurst that nervousness may have gone forever now that once have heard gun fired close to without nerve giving way a usual be quite possible that might do so again say that must be possible indeed seems to to be probable may be that sudden shock when jumped into water acting upon nerve when in state of extreme tension may have set right bullet graze along top of skull may have aided effect of shock men frequently lose nerve after heavy fall from horse sudden attack by tiger other unexpected shock may be that with have have reverse consequence hope to god that may be so doctor bathurst said with deep earnestness be certainly extraordinary must not have felt when fired within few foot of head if get down to allahabad will try will place near gun when be going to be fired if stand will come up again join column a volunteer take part in work of vengeance if can once bear part a man be welcome to kill in next engagement pooh pooh man be not born to be killed in battle after making target on roof at deennugghur jumping down in middle of sepoys in breach getting through attack in boat think be fated to meet end with bullet well now let walk on join others isobel must be wondering how much longer be going to talk together can not exchange word with native must be dull work for be great deal thinner than be before trouble came on see how differently walk have quite lost that elastic step of hers dare say be good deal due to walking with bare foot instead of in english boot boot have good deal to do with walk look at difference between walk of gentleman who have always worn well fitting boot of countryman who have gone about in thick iron shod boot life breeding go for something doubt alters man walk just a alters horse gait bathurst must not help laughing at doctor dropping into usual style of discussing thing be foot feeling tender isobel latter asked cheerfully a overtook in front doctor said with smile know be ever thankful for dust before be now be so soft that be like walking on carpet of course feel very strange have only to fancy dear that be by seaside walking down from bathing machine across sand once get that in mind will get perfectly comfortable requires too great stretch of imagination doctor to think for moment in sweltering heat be enjoying sea breeze on english coast be silly of course to give even thought when one be accustomed to see almost woman without shoe think must mind more than do if foot be not stained know why must please talk about try to forget to fancy be really native met few people on road did meet passed with usual salutation there be nothing strange in party of peasant passing along road might have be at work at cawnpore be now returning to native village to get away
