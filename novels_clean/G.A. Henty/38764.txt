only just joined ship if ask others will tell have have at least dozen fight over name be understood thing here that if anyone want row with have only got to call nathaniel there be occasion for more word after that speaker be pleasant faced lad between fifteen sixteen word be half in jest half in earnest be general favourite among mess mate on board h m frigate orpheus be full of life fun exceptionally good tempered able to stand amount of chaff joking be understood by comrade that there be one point that be unsafe to touch on that sore point be name have be choice of godmother maiden aunt who have in earlier day have disappointment nat have once closely questioned father a to how came by name latter have replied testily well boy aunt eliza who be know very good woman one can doubt have weakness never got at right of matter anyhow name be nathaniel think there be ever formal engagement between own idea be that loved that parent forbade to think of for be at time before aunt lydia left money to anyhow went abroad think ever heard of again be inclined to think be entire mistake on part that young fellow have never have slightest fancy for however be one romance of life have clung to like limpet to rock at rate when asked to be godmother said must be so if must give name of nathaniel own be not name like when raised objection said that name be very dear to that if took must certainly make heir more than hinted that if have other name must leave money to charitable purpose well see a be worth thirty thousand pound if be worth penny mother thought must be folly to allow money to go out of family for sake of name after be not such bad name think beastly father in first place because be long well boy if like can shorten to nathan oh must be hundred time worse nathan indeed nat be not so bad if have be christened nat must not have particularly minded why did not propose that to aunt father shook head must never have done to be always nathaniel possibly if have be married might day have become nat see never got to well of course father boy said with sigh a thing be done can not be helped say aunt be good sort first rate in thing for have always tipped

always getting into row why first two three year went to school must say that have fight over once month of course have not have one lately for since licked smith major fellow be more careful expect will be just a bad in navy so when first joined nat have found now that be nearly sixteen very strong active with experience of many past combat name nathaniel have be dropped be six month since obnoxious christian name have be used a be now by young fellow of seventeen who have be transferred to orpheus when frigate to belonged be ordered home be tall lanky very particular about dress spoke in drawling supercilious way have knack of saying unpleasant thing with air of innocence supposing that glover name must be nathaniel have thought smart so to address although guessed that might irritate be unprepared for explosion on part of lad who be proverbially good tempered dear said in assumed surprise have idea that objected so much to be called by proper name however will of course in future use abbreviation have better call glover nat replied sharply friend can call nat to other people be glover if call out of name there will be squall so warn curtis thought be well not to pursue subject further be coward have sense to see that a nat be favourite with others while be new comer fight even if be victor must not conduce to popularity among mess mate president of mess master mate good tempered fellow who hated quarrel broke what must have be awkward silence by saying seem to be out of luck altogether trip have be out three week not fired shot be especially hard for caught sight of brigantine have be in search of must have have if have run into channel where there be not water enough for to follow yes be rough upon one hate to go back to port royal without prize after having taken so many that have come to be considered luckiest ship on station said still cruise be not over yet suppose by way be laying course marston be going into cape francois mate nodded yes want fresh meat fruit water be about pleasantest place among island have doubt too that captain hope to get news may help to find out where piratical craft be doing so much mischief have rendezvous be so fast that unless in strong breeze frigate have chance whatever of overhauling there be doubt that be of spanish build in light breeze sail like witch believe only chance of catching be in finding at head quarter wherever may be by coming upon in calm in bay in case must be boat affair pretty sharp one must think for carry very strong crew be heavily armed a scoundrel know that fight with rope round neck must be awkward customer to tackle yes if happened to find together think captain must risk sending in boat one at time must manage with three of mounting about fifty gun between carrying must say from two hundred to two hundred fifty men odds must be very great loss even if captured so heavy that hardly think captain must be justified in attempting must say that must be more likely to get out boat tow frigate into easy range must give good account of whole of yes there be doubt about even then must only succeed if bay be very narrow one for otherwise boat must certainly tow faster than must take frigate along be glover who spoke last think that will ever catch in frigate seems to that only chance will be to get hold of old merchantman put strong crew on board dozen of gun cruise about until one of get sight of come skimming along to capture yes must be good plan have be tried several time with success fancy pirate must not fall into trap besides there be very little doubt that have friend at port get early information of movement of ship must hear of what be doing long before disguised ship came near can hardly be chance that matter not way cruise fellow begin work in direction altogether now that be here in great bay be probably cruising off west of cuba down by porto rico windward island be advantage three four craft working together have be able to keep spy in port that ship of war be likely to go into while single vessel can not afford such expense think that expense low must be heavy negro must do for next to nothing so must mulatto simply because hate white mean best of mulatto because many of be gentleman good fellow lower class be worse than negro be up to devilment will do anything can to injure white man poor beggar one can hardly blame be one thing other old french planter be a aristocratic a noblesse at home indeed many of belong to noble family even meanest white be pretty mean of look down upon mulatto although latter may have be educated in france own great plantation negro like because of strain of white blood be treated a if be pariah child may not go to school with white may not sit down in theatre kneel at church next to may not use same restaurant hotel wonder be discontented be hard on glover said one ca be surprised that white do fight shy of great number of be brute mistake ready for crime up to wickedness there be lot of good in nigger be merry fellow must say for old french planter use slave great deal better than be a rule treated by planter in jamaica of course there be bad master everywhere if be slave must certainly rather be under french master than english one from what have heard than american very well glover will make note of if ever misbehave have to sell

anxious to rejoin ship brought back news that vessel in port must sail for port royal in two day have engaged cabin for said for although will be sorry indeed to lose know that want to be off be not want to be off sir for be never happier in life feel ought to go be likely enough that ship may be short of middy one two may be away in prize will be strange if one fall sick while be lying in port

heartily captain be on shore nat be confused abashed at warmth of greeting be perfectly ridiculous said almost angrily a rejoined midshipman a if there be anything extraordinary in fellow fighting dog depends upon size of dog size of fellow needham senior midshipman said also how got into fight fact be needham if have killed dog with first stroke of dirk nobody must have thought anything about matter be just because must not do so therefore got badly mauled before managed that fuss be made must have be much more to point if have grumbled when came on board at being nursed coddled while have to do duty between just because be such duffer be couple of minute in killing dog instead of managing at once well might have done so if have thought of see did not look at in light nat needham laughed there be certainly good deal in what say however will in future look upon dirk a being of more use than have hitherto thought have always considered most absurd weapon be ever put into anyone hand to use in action not of course that one doe use for one always get hold of cutlas when there be fighting to be done how anyone can ever have have idea of making midshipman carry about thing little better than pocket knife how have kept on doing so for year year be most astonishing for lord of admiralty must have be midshipman at one time must have hated beastly thing just a much a do if think full sized sword too heavy for certainly be for senior might give rapier be weight to speak of must be really useful weapon if be taught to use properly well wo say anything more about affair nat if like sha' think le because be proud of whatever may say be very plucky action know must rather stand up against biggest frenchman than face one of savage hound how be arm going on see still have arm of jacket snipped open tied up with ribbon keep in sling doctor made point of be obliged to promise to wear until bemish give permission to lay aside took out of sling moved about see have

broken asking nat if hurt replied without hesitation a long a doctor be feeling forearm when came to upper arm shoulder be obliged to acknowledge that pressure gave bit of twinge yes must hardly be otherwise doctor said however there be doubt made pretty good job of stretch arm out in front of bring finger together yes be just what expected be two half inch shorter than other one will be likely to notice think doctor can go to sea now captain said that must have to decide think month up in hill must be very desirable thing glover bone have knit very well must not take much to break again have have quite enough of plantation for present doctor do think that sea air must do more good than anything be sure feel better already for run from cape francois here doctor smiled well see if did remain on board must be out of everything certainly must not be fit for boat service must see that ca say that do sir one fight with one right arm not with one left be so lad might get hit on left arm a well a right besides even on board might get hurt while skylarking must indeed be most careful doctor well will see about talk over with captain that evening be in state of alarm whenever anyone came with message to of mess mate when be almost hour for light out turned into hammock with great satisfaction feeling sure that if have be decided that must go ashore next morning message to effect must have be sent to sound of boatswain whistle followed by call hand to make sail settled question have already dressed with needham assistance have remained below lest if captain eye fell on might be sent ashore a soon however a heard order felt sure that be right went up on deck here took up usual station passing order forward watching men at work until vessel be under sail want of success on last cruise made hand even keener than usual to pick up something worth capturing suppose there be clue a to whereabouts of three pirate said to needham a latter after vessel be fairly under weigh joined twice have information from captain of small craft that have seen suspicious sail in distance there be doubt that nigger have be either bribed frightened into telling story for in case though remained fortnight cruising about have never caught sight of suspicious sail when returned here found to disgust that must have be at work hundred of mile away a several ship be missing one came in have be hotly chased by being fast sailer escaped by skin of teeth be worst of negro one can never believe think best way must be when anyone came told yarn to go cruise exactly in opposite direction to in tell have seen pirate be pity can not punish of fellow who give false news nat said yes difficulty be proving that be false in first place one of native craft be so much like one must not recognize again besides may be sure that rascal must give port royal wide berth for time on last cruise did take with negro who brought news that made case better pretended of course to be a anxious a anyone that pirate must be caught a stuck to story that have seen rakish schooner where said did there be proof that be lying pretended to be terribly cut up at not getting reward promised if came across have doubt that be lying there be way of proving see idea of getting hold of trader fitting up with few gun men be well enough when have only got to deal with single schooner brigantine must be catching tartar if three scoundrel be to come upon at once of course be heavily armed carry number of men nothing short of frigate must be match for one thing be certain ca disguise to look like merchantman do what must veriest landlubber must make out to be what be may be sure pirate must know to be ship of war a soon a got sight of topsail have not heard suppose where cruising ground be going to be time nat asked suppose will know for few hour may be sure that course take now will not be real course for bet odds that after dark fast little craft will sneak out of harbour to take pirate news a to course be following to tell that have not taken negro time who must lead dance in wrong direction must not be surprised if be going to search island round cuba for change be among bay islet up north on last cruise captain may be determined to try fresh ground needham guess turned out to be correct for after darkness fell ship course be changed head laid towards cuba after cruising for nearly three week without success be passing along coast of mainland when nat who have now given up sling went aloft with telescope eye on deck be turned towards island continued failure have lessened eagerness with scanned shore a there be sign of break in outline be more from habit than from hope of seeing anything that looked at rugged cliff rose forty fifty foot perpendicularly above water edge at forest stretching up hillside behind have seen nothing suppose tom asked sailor stationed in main top not thing mr glover nat continued way up took seat on yard of topsail leaning back against mast brought telescope to bear upon land for hour scanned rock tree at last something caught eye come up here tom called to sailor below look there see that black streak on face of cliff see yer honour well look above first line of tree exactly over be that pole with truck on top of be right sir be right sailor said a got glass to bear upon object nat have indicated that be upper spar of vessel of sort sure enough on deck there nat shouted what be mr glover first lieutenant answered can make out upper spar of craft in among tree over there sir be sure that be not mistaken quite sure sir with glass can make out truck quite distinctly be certainly either upper spar of craft of kind flag staff of course can not say first lieutenant ran up ratline joined nat breeze be very light orpheus be scarcely moving through water nat handed telescope to mr hill there sir be about yard to west of black streak on rock see lieutenant exclaimed after long gaze at shore be right must be a say spar of ship flag staff though how ship must get in there be more than can say there have gone now tree be rather lower at point where saw higher tree have shut in descended to deck followed by nat well what do make of mr hill enquired captain who have come out of cabin on hearing nat hail there be doubt that mr glover be right sir that be upper spar of craft of kind unless be flag staff on shore be hardly sort of place in must expect to find flag staff be marvel mr glover made out for even with glass have great difficulty in finding though gave exact bearing thank mr glover captain said at last there seems chance of picking up prize cruise question be how did get there be pretty sure that have passed opening sir have be aloft for past half hour have made out break in rock be quite possible captain said yet may be there be good three quarter of mile off shore of inlet be so narrow rock so much same colour that unless one know entrance be there one must never suspect at rate will hold on a be for bit hail have set everyone on deck on qui vive dozen telescope be turned upon shore unlikely a seems hill captain said after have gone on mile without discovering break in line of rock be afraid that must have be flag staff that saw there may be plantation there owner may have have one put up in front of house however will be worth while to lower boat row back along foot of cliff for mile so then mile ahead of if there be opening will be sure to find tell mr playford to take gig mr glover can go with a be discoverer boat be lowered at once a soon a officer have taken place six men who composed crew bent back to oar coxswain making for point on shore about mile astern of frigate be lying almost becalmed men have taken musket cutlass with for be probable enough that watch might have be set on cliff must there be inlet boat might be lying there ready to pounce out upon a soon a reached eye be fixed upon boat a turned rowed along within fifty yard of foot of rock thought must not have be so blind a to pas entrance without seeing one of sailor who have be on watch aloft said in tone of satisfaction now mind how soon boat find gap when boat have paddled on for mile without pause look of doubt dissatisfaction showed on face be quite sure mr hill captain asked that be staff of kind that saw not perhaps top of dead tree whose bark have peeled off be quite certain sir be too straight even for rough wood made out truck distinctly be certainly strange that entrance must be discovered be afraid that 't be flag staff after can hardly imagine that captain said have often seen flag staff in front of plantation house never one so high a must be to show over tree if have be nearer to edge of cliff might have be signal post must hardly put mile back from edge of cliff bury among tree at rate if find entrance will send landing party ashore to see what really be be to say if can find place where cliff can be scaled what be mr a midshipman came up touched hat boat be rowing in to shore two officer went to side have found entrance point at rock can be scaled ah there go went on a boat disappeared from sight though from here there be appearance whatever of opening be minute before boat again appeared be at once headed for frigate mr playford have news for of sort captain said men be rowing hard in few minute boat came alongside second officer ran up accommodation ladder well mr playford what be news there be inlet sir though if have not be close in to rock must never have noticed run almost parallel with coast for quarter of mile thought at first that ended there make sharp angle to south east continues for mile so at other end there be large schooner have doubt slaver fancy be landing slave now there be barracoon on shore storehouse did see sir at least think so directly saw that passage be going to make turn went close in to rock on other side brought up at corner where must get view without there being much fear of being seen indeed think that must have be possible to make out unless someone have be watching with glass will soon know whether saw mr playford if did will probably set hand to work to tow schooner out for though there be not wind enough to give steerage way slaver will slip along under slightest breath can hardly have made frigate out probably thought hiding place so secure that did not even put watch on cliff of course if there be anyone up there must have seen boat leave side must have watched along did see place at cliff must be climbed sir up to turn rock be just a steep inside a be here beyond that inlet widens out good deal bank slope gradually landing must be effected anywhere there must say will send boat in a soon a get dark mr hill if saw coming must drive off slave into wood before must get there so best plan will be to land strong party at bend so that can get down to barracoon at same time that others board schooner doubt be regular nest of slave trader have long be suspected that there be depot on side of island have often be observed that slaver when first made out be heading in direction more than once craft be chased a seemed certain to be caught in morning have mysteriously disappeared hiding place account for did not ascertain what depth of water there be at mouth of creek mr playford yes sir sounded right across with boat grapnel there be nowhere more than two half fathom be just about depth right across then be evident that can not take frigate in what be width at mouth about thirty yard hour later orpheus anchored opposite mouth of inlet however be still invisible think that a may be important capture mr hill must be a well for to go in charge of boat mr playford will take command of landing party must say that twenty marine under lieutenant boldero a many blue jacket must be ample for that have better take long boat one of gig while take launch pinnace other gig if have made out may expect very tough resistance may be that although mr playford saw nothing of may have couple of battery higher up likely enough sir have better let landing party have start of so that if must unmask battery on side on be can rush down at once silence very good sir sun be now approaching horizon a soon a dipped behind boat be lowered sailor who have already made preparation at once took place in be in command of gig carried portion of landing party nat be in charge of other gig low be in charge of pinnace mr hill going in launch nat have first be told off to gig now commanded by needham captain said to first lieutenant have better take glover with mr hill let needham go with mr playford scrambling along on shore in dark one might very well get heavy fall be a well that glover must not risk breaking arm again chapter iii slave depot night fell rapidly a soon a sun have set by time boat reached mouth of inlet be already dark two boat under second officer entered first rowed up inlet to bend landed marine sailor on opposite side boarding party lay on oar for five minute then followed oar be muffled men ordered to row a noiselessly a must following other closely keeping under left bank be about way up when word fire be shouted in spanish six gun be simultaneously discharged have spaniard waited few second longer three boat must have be in line with gun a be storm of grape sent water splashing up ahead of pinnace however received content of gun nearest to be aimed little low fortunately for crew shot have not yet begun to scatter whole charge struck boat just at water level knocking great hole in be sinking mr hill low said will come alongside pick up although launch be length behind gunwale of pinnace be nearly level with water a came alongside occupant be helped on board launch at once held on way minute later six gun be fired from opposite bank boat be so close under shore that position must not be made out with certainty three men be hit by grapeshot beyond there be casualty keep in a much a dare mr hill said to coxswain battery opposite will be loaded again in couple of minute a long a keep in shadow of shore shooting will be wild battery indeed soon began to fire again irregularly a gun be loaded shot tore up water ahead astern of boat be evident that at gun must not make out precise position five minute boat be headed for schooner board at bow mr glover will make for quarter now lay out lad a hard a can sooner be there le chance have of being hit moment later great clamour arose behind first came british cheer then rapid discharge of pistol musket mingled with clash of cutlass sword minute two later ceased loud cheer of marine seaman told in boat that have carried battery diversion be useful to boat until now slaver have be ignorant that party of foe have landed fact that barracoon full of slave storehouse be already threatened caused something like consternation among consequence be that fired hastily without taking time to aim before must load again boat be alongside unchecked for instant by musketry fire broke out from deck of schooner a soon a cannon have be discharged boarding netting have be run up hole be soon chopped in by sailor headed by nat crew of gig leapt down on to deck for greater part of slaver crew ran aft to oppose what considered more dangerous attack made by occupant of crowded launch defence be successfully maintained until crew of gig keeping close together brushing aside resistance of few men forward flung upon main body of slaver with pistol cutlas hewed way through till abreast of launch slaver attacked furiously must speedily have annihilated crew of launch led by mr hill came swarming over bulwark taking offensive drove slaver forward where seeing that be lost sprang overboard striking out for shore to right severe fighting be now going on schooner where landing party be evidently attacking barracoon storehouse illustration headed by nat crew of gig leapt down on to deck to boat men mr hill shouted fellow be being hard pressed on shore mr glover with gig crew will remain in charge here indeed be evident that resistance on shore be much more obstinate than have be expected nat stood watching boat just a reached shore one of sailor shouted look out sir saw big mulatto rushing at with uplifted sword cutlas be still in hand throwing on guard caught blow a fell upon in return brought cutlas down on opponent cheek with howl of pain man sprang at nat leaped aside cutlas fell on right wrist of mulatto whose sword dropped from hand rushing to side threw overboard in meantime fierce struggle be going on between sailor seven eight of slaver who being unable to swim have thrown down by gun shammed death a have nat antagonist who be first mate of schooner fight be short desperate one by one slaver be run through cut down not before three four of sailor have received severe wound get lantern mate one of growled see that there be more of skulking hound alive sailor furious at what considered treachery fetched light be burning in captain cabin without mercy ran through two three unwounded men whom found hiding among fallen be soon clear that reinforcement have landed have completely turned table gradually din rolled away from neighbourhood of storehouse there be sharp firing a enemy fled towards wood behind then be quiet presently there be shout in mr hill voice from shore schooner ahoy ay ay sir load with grape mr glover send round two occasionally into wood behind house be going to leave thirty men here under mr playford to take rest over to opposite side carry battery there ay ay sir a gun pointing on side have not be discharged at once opened fire on wood minute later launch gig rowed past schooner soon reached opposite side ten minute passed without sound of conflict being heard nat have doubt that battery have be found deserted be not long before boat be seen returning rowed time to schooner mr glover first lieutenant said a reached deck do lower schooner cutter put wounded on board take four of men row out to frigate report to captain what have taken place tell that mr playford carried battery on right in spite of gun have spiked in battery on left found deserted say that have have sharp fight on shore with large number of negro led by two three white men mulatto believe there must be large plantation close at hand whose owner be in league with slaver can say that found hundred twenty slave in barracoon evidently newly landed from schooner intend to find plantation give lesson in morning how many wounded have here there be fourteen altogether sir ten of be wounded in first attack four have be wounded since by of slaver who shammed death there be eight more in launch happily have only two men killed have better give wounded drink of water have flask dare say have one empty into bucket there be barrel half full of water on deck bucketful of be drawn two flask of spirit emptied into mug of mixture given to of wounded men be then assisted down into schooner boat four of gig crew took place in nat taking tiller told to row on hour later came alongside frigate sailor ran down ladder with lantern nat stepped out mounted to deck captain be standing at gangway have be uneasy about mr glover heard number of report of heavier gun than be likely to carry on board slaver feared that came from shore battery yes sir there be two of mounting six gun mr playford with landing party captured one on eastern side mr hill after schooner be taken enemy on shore driven off rowed across took other found unoccupied what be loss only two killed sir there be twenty two wounded two three of by musket shot rest cutlas wound be in boat below party be at once sent down to carry up such of wounded a be unable to walk a soon a be taken below surgeon have begun work captain asked nat to give full account of proceeding can not tell much of what took place ashore sir said a mr hill left in charge of schooner after have carried went ashore with crew of launch pinnace to help mr playford tell know first nat related opening of two battery how one have be almost immediately captured by mr playford so pinnace be sunk yes sir enemy charge struck between wind water went down at once crew be picked up by launch hear that none of be injured then told how have kept under shelter of shore thus escaped injury from other battery how schooner have be captured be lucky that men got footing forward mr glover did well to lead aft at once thus assist mr hill party to board nat then related sudden attack by slaver who have be feigning death be lucky that be worse captain said doubt be fellow who must swim if there have be few more must have gone hard with now about fight on shore can hardly have be crew of schooner for by stout resistance offered must have be on board yes sir nat then gave message mr hill have sent no doubt mr glover dare say place have be used by slaver for year probably there be large barracoons where slave be generally housed planter who want come send from part of island will go ashore early to morrow morning there be question that be important capture will be great thing to break up centre of slave trade altogether now that hiding place have once be discovered will know that cruiser will keep sharp look out here vessel once bottled up in inlet have chance whatever of escape can go with be thanks to sharpness of eye that made discovery sun have not yet shown above eastern horizon when captain gig passed in through mouth of inlet ten minute later rowed alongside wharf in front of barracoon there be wharf farther along captain said may take that a proof that there be often two of slaver in here at same time ah there be mr hill congratulate on success went on a first lieutenant joined there be doubt that have be regular rendezvous for scoundrel be well that attacked after dark for cross fire of battery aided by of schooner must have knocked boat into matchwood that must have done sir be very glad when saw boat coming a thought be probable that be on board be rather in difficulty what be mr hill well sir a soon a have settled matter here followed enemy found road running up valley a be along that most of fellow who opposed have doubt retreated thought a well to follow up at once have evidently be watched for musketry fire be opened upon from tree on side sent mr boldero with marine to clear out on left mr playford with twenty seaman to do same on right then pressed forward with rest presently crowd of negro came rushing down from front shouting firing musket gave volley bolted at once ran straight on hundred yard farther up came upon large clearing in middle stood house evidently that of planter short distance off be house probably inhabited by mulatto overseer few hut for white overseer distance behind be four large barracoons made straight for for must hear shouting there have doubt that mulatto be trying to get slave out to drive away into wood however a soon a came up fellow bolted there be about hundred slave in barracoon doubt fellow who attacked be regular plantation hand suppose owner of place made sure that must be contented with what have done must not go beyond head of inlet when firing began again sent plantation men down to stop until have removed slave left mr playford in command there brought twenty men back here be just going to send off message to saying what have taken place asking for instruction see with slave found here have over five hundred black in hand be extremely awkward extremely captain said thoughtfully well will go back with see place a to house plantation house barracoons will have hesitation in destroying be evidently huge slaving establishment a black overseer attacked be perfectly justified in destroying den altogether if must catch owner must assuredly hang difficulty be what to do with unfortunate creature schooner must not hold more than two hundred if packed a close a herring however other thing be first to be thought of nat followed commander lieutenant to plantation must rather be said to depot for clearing in valley be quarter of mile long few hundred yard wide be evident that if owner have plantation be at distance away that men with whom have fought be principally mulatto negro employed about place in minding slave a be brought in passed straight on to barracoons sailor have already brought slave out knocked off iron poor creature sat on ground evidently bewildered at what have taken place uncertain whether be in hand of friend enemy of men have found cauldron in food be cooked mr hill said be now preparing meal for a found hogshead of molasses store of flour rice will get better meal than be accustomed to have set of strongest slave to pump water into big trough there poor beggar will feel better after wash will indeed suppose have have one since be first captured in africa in hour meal be served a effort of cooking must hardly be termed success be sort of porridge composed of flour rice sweetened with molasses there be difficulty in serving out for only few mug plate be found at barracoons be supplemented by plate dish other utensil in house of owner overseer by time negro have be taken in party of twenty to trough where have thorough wash be very well mr hill captain said what be to do with people of course must move down to water burn building in first place because scoundrel who be at bottom of villainy must be punished in second place because in probability will collect large number of negro mulatto make attack can not leave force here must defend therefore whatever decide upon afterwards be clear that slave must be taken down to house on inlet must set men to open store load negro with everything can be useful expect will find good deal of cotton cloth so on for doubt man here dealt in other article besides slave must moreover keep cotton sort of thing for sending up country into market however take everything be worth taking in way of food otherwise carry down to storehouse by water then set house shed here on fire when see well alight can bring men down to shore then must settle a to course be most awkward thing coming upon slave if there be only who have be landed from schooner there must be difficulty about a must only have to put on board again with four hundred others on hand really know how to manage might stow hundred in frigate though own must not like indeed mr hill murmured four hundred must be out of question captain returned to inlet made examination of storehouse there be for most part empty be six in number roughly constructed of timber forty foot long by twenty wide consisted only of one floor stood ten foot apart barracoon be twenty yard away in short time slave began to pour in men woman child carrying burden proportionate to strength have now come to conclusion that new captor be really friend with light heartedness of race laughed chattered a if past suffering be already forgotten mr playford saw to storing of burden filled one of storehouse to roof there be a captain have anticipated large quantity of cotton cloth among spoil of bale be placed outside store twenty of negro be told off to cut stuff up into length for clothing by mid day whole of slave be to delight attired in new wrap among good have be brought down be number of implement tool ax hoe shovel long knife captain crosbie have by time quite made up mind a to plan to be pursued must hold place for time mr hill said a latter came down with last body of sailor after having seen that building in valley be wrapped in flame have be thinking over question of slave only plan can see be to go for two three day cruise in frigate in hope of falling in with native craft with can make arrangement for to return here with aid in carrying off poor creature five storehouse barracoon will hold pretty comfortably two of storehouse have better be given up to woman child will make stockade round building with end resting in water get gun from battery put in position here with help of on board schooner stout defence can be made to attack however formidable will leave mr playford in command with forty men on shore mr glover will be in charge of schooner with five twenty more frigate will remain for couple of day at present anchorage will send a many men a can spare ashore to help in finishing work before sail in first place there must be barrack run up for men on shore between barracoon storehouse must be made of stout beam mean squared young tree placed side by side so a to be perfectly musket proof palisade must be made of strong sapling wattled together say ten foot high hundred fifty sailor aided by three hundred fifty able bodied negro must make quick work of schooner crew can see to removal of gun from battery establishment upon platform behind palisade must divide twelve gun into four battery three in armourer will come off in morning to get out spike carpenter will come with tool there be dozen cross cut saw among thing that have brought down sir be good how many ax be there four dozen sir good will send hatchet have on board think mr hill that have better take up position on board schooner until sail how about water be most important point slave have brought down large number of stave sir be evidently intended for sugar hogshead be done up in separate packet must say there be hundred of be satisfactory indeed will send cooper ashore with gang of black fellow will soon get into shape see that have relied upon stream come down from hill for supply one of first move of anyone attacking place must be to divert course somewhere up in hill however with such supply a hogshead must hold must do without stream for week twenty marine who came ashore with lieutenant boldero will remain a part of garrison work be at once begun sailor looked upon a pleasant change from ordinary routine of life on board ship threw into vigorously while black a soon a understood what be wanted proved most useful assistant accustomed in african home to palisade village knew exactly what be required with hoe dug trench four foot deep others dragged down pole a sailor cut erected in place trod earth firmly round others cut creeper split up suitable wood wove in out between pole by time darkness fell surprising amount of work have be accomplished one of storehouse be turned over to who must not be berthed on board schooner most of slave preferring to sleep in open air to be delightful change after being cooped up for week in crowded hold of ship in le crowded barracoons sentry be posted a soon a became dark night passed off without alarm at daybreak be at work again launch returned to frigate when work be knocked off came back with fresh body of men in morning with carpenter cooper available tool on board by evening of third day work be completed four bank of earth have be thrown up by negro against palisade on of three gun be mounted hut for garrison have be completed hogshead be put together filled with water couple of hundred boarding pike be put ashore for use of negro have be fully employed with schooner crew in removing gun from battery placing on platform constructed by carpenter on top of earthwork be quite possible captain said to mr playford that creek be used by pirate a well a slaver may come in here to sell good have captured suitable for use in island such a cotton cloth tool must not pay to carry to regular rendezvous will be great luck if one two of must put in here while be away must greatly diminish difficulty have of getting slave away must be fortunate indeed sir even if two came in together must give good account of for a palisade be mostly on higher ground than hut must only have to slue gun round give warm welcome that must probably haul down flag at once yes have better tell mr glover to run up spanish flag if doubtful looking craft be seen to be making for entrance must always keep couple of signaller up on cliff so a to let know beforehand what might have to expect to see that there be nothing showing must excite suspicion until be too late for to turn back doubtless what be going on in inlet have be closely watched from wood for in evening of day on frigate sailed away scattered shot be fired from forest sound of beating of tom tom blowing of horn must be heard in direction of plantation whose building have destroyed lieutenant have gone off to dine with nat be sitting on deck smoking cigar when firing began almost expected said doubt have be waiting for frigate to leave before did anything a must know at least half of who have be ashore must re embark when left have doubt scoundrel whose place burnt have sent to planter in part of island to assemble in force to attack if have seen making palisade mounting gun a doubt have done certainly will not venture to assault place unless be in very strong force can make very unpleasant for be not more than eighty yard to other side of creek from hill must completely command will scarcely be able to keep man on deck will have to stay in shelter of hut of course on side must scarcely be able to annoy for must have to come down to edge of tree to fire a must fire through palisade upon must get worst of might row across in boat sir clear wood of if became too troublesome must run risk of losing good many men in doing so good many more a made way up through tree drove out must gain nothing by for a soon a retired must reoccupy position if get very troublesome will slue couple of gun round occasionally send round two of grape among tree will be better than doing so because men at gun must make easy mark for while be farther off indeed almost out of range of musket firing soon died away in morning be reopened be evident that number in wood have largely increased bullet after bullet struck deck of schooner nat be obliged to order greater part of crew to remain below to see that who remained on deck kept under shelter of bulwark presently sharp fire broke out from tree facing palisade be almost immediately replied to by blue jacket marine fire of assailant soon slackened nat thought that have only be begun with object of finding out how strong force have be left behind presently two of gun on shore spoke out sent volley of grape into wood in own assailant be lurking have effect of temporarily silencing fire from quarter however be for short time when began again be taken up on other side also party have made demonstration against palisade evidently considering that schooner lay midway between two shore be safer object of attack than stockade a bulwark now offered shelter went below two of men be about to pull up boat be lying at stern nat went to ladder to take place in when be hailed from shore have better stay where be mr glover until get dusk must only be mark for man with musket up in tree above so far a can see there be nothing can do until begin work in earnest very well sir nat shouted back will come off after get dusk firing continued day died away at sunset soon afterwards nat went ashore be very awkward lieutenant said be most unpleasant being potted at day by fellow who wo show ca see that can help by noise jabbering break out at time must think that there must be hundred of on side alone will have to wait till begin in earnest leader must know that can be doing harm by distant fire must sooner later make attack on see have strong temptation must have seen that none of slave have be taken away a there be five hundred of suppose be worth from twenty to forty pound head be big thing to say nothing of store then have doubt be thirsting for revenge although must see that will have to fight very hard to take place must try without delay for will know that frigate will be back again before very long will probably bring craft with to carry away slave so think must put up with fire till harden heart attack in earnest will make attack expect about centre of palisade for gun must cover flank if be hard pressed will light port fire have better land with twenty of men leaving five to take care of ship work gun two must try to take in flank must not be surprised if tried to night will bring ten of men on shore at once sir well perhaps must be a well forty men be not very large force for length of palisade to work of gun at point where may attack expect first rush will be serious one will have work cut out for there be one thing can rely in case of making way in on slave by time quite understand that be friend that people who have be firing on be enemy believe must fight like demon rather than fall into hand again have torn up bale of white calico have given strip of to man to tie round head so that can tell friend from foe can recognize other in dark enemy wo reckon on will think that have only small body of white to deal with do notice how silent wood be now think may take that a sign that be preparing for mischief sooner come better have plenty of port fire mr playford yes large boxful came on shore with last boat yesterday nat went off again picked out ten men to land with get other boat down said to petty officer will understand that if attack be made on flank of work be to open fire at once upon with grape if blue light be burned at edge of water ten men be to land instantly will remain in charge of other five so far a know have boat may have made raft may intend to try take schooner thinking that crew will probably be on shore so must keep sharp look out on other side a well a light blue light if see strong party coming off will rejoin at once again landed with ten men have chosen have six men on watch lieutenant said have put one of black with fancy ear be sharper than ours be will hear coming before men do having nothing to do nat went into barracoon other house in slave be placed contrast between condition now when have seen four day before when have first be found be striking indeed now be clean looked picturesque in bright calico clothes look of dull hopeless misery have passed away seemed to that with good plentiful food have received be already perceptibly plumper must have risen a entered signed to to keep place now have room to lie down in comfort while sat chatting in group others moved about be evidently proud of arm of seizing pike hatchet made sign how must fight enemy ship lantern be burning in hut in woman hut scene be still more interesting little child ran up to nat with new born confidence in white men of woman brought up baby to show endeavoured to make understand that must soon have died have not be for sailor window door stood open evening breeze cleared hut of effluvium always present where number of negro congregate together sight of poor creature enraged nat still more against slaver made long for to begin attack be quite pleasant to see said a joined mr playford be wonderfully changed in short time one must hardly have thought possible what will become of expect will take to jamaica that there will be let out a free labourer to planter see there be law against slave trade though public opinion be so strong on subject at home have doubt law will be passed before long so of course have not captured slave because of being slave simply a must capture destroy other property belonging to enemy then too many of slaver act a pirate if get chance there can be little doubt that considerable quantity of good found be proceeds of piracy besides must remember that fired at before fired at so have plenty of good reason for releasing poor beggar see sea swarm with scoundrel of kind be quite safe to assume that ship can not show that be peaceful trader be engaged in nefarious business of kind other chapter iv sharp fight mr playford nat be still talking when sailor came up to with one of negro what be tomkins lieutenant asked well sir 'ere black seems to hear something keep pointing up into wood whispering something in own lingo looking very excited so thought have better bring here to quite right tomkins doubt doe hear something ear be good deal better than ours be will go up with accompanied by nat mr playford went up on to bank of earth have be thrown up against palisade found that negro there be in state of excitement pointing in various direction shaking pike angrily be coming there be doubt of that said must say by motion of black that be scattered through wood well be ready for have better get slow match alight lad take cover off vent until last moment dew be heavy be joined now by lieutenant boldero think can hear said yes must not have noticed if have not be for black there be certainly confused noise in air listening attentively must hear low rustling sound with sometimes faint crack a of breaking stick a soon a think that have got to edge of tree will throw fireball out in direction then let have must keep from getting closer if can when once get near foot of palisade will not be able to depress gun enough to fire upon in short time there be question that large number of men be making way down through wood black be now brought out from house ranged along at foot of bank where be ordered to stay for present a be to man line must be exposed to assailant bullet while powerless to do service until latter began to attempt to scale stockade must be gathering at edge of tree now lieutenant said at last now tomkins light that fireball heave over ball be formed of old junk be about size of man head material have be smeared with tar mixed with sulphur tomkins held in hand lanyard attached to applied slow match to broke into blaze at once swinging round head hurled far in front of by light a fell crowd of figure must be seen gathered along edge of forest fierce yell broke from loud shout be raised by leader ordering to charge before must get into motion four gun poured storm of grape among followed directly afterwards by content of four others appalling din of yell shriek be heard without instant hesitation score of figure in european dress darted forward followed by mass of black behind whom came thirty forty european mulatto driving negro before pick off white lieutenant boldero shouted to marine dropping fire of musketry be at once opened distance however from edge of tree to palisade be fifty yard light be dim uncertain in minute from first shot being fired assailant be swarming along foot of palisade there be hesitation be evident that men who led attack have made preparation number of assailant carried ladder be placed against wall white mulatto swarmed up closely followed by negro so sudden unexpected be assault that in several place obtained footing inside palisade with wild yell slave at once rushed up bank fell upon at same moment boom of schooner gun told that have made out party of enemy advancing against flank of work arrival of slave soon changed position assailant be cut down run through forced to leap down over stockade that have just crossed in spite of shout of lieutenant slave thirsting for vengeance leapt down after fell with such fury upon assailant that seized with panic fled at edge of tree however effort of white checked flight gun pistol be discharged for first time fierce fight presently raged must go down lend hand lieutenant said keep men here mr glover to get gun loaded again will take blue jacket marine light port fire two else in spite of white head gear will be hurting friend sailor marine soon scrambled down ladder led by officer rushed forward with loud cheer arrival at once decided fortune of fray rushing through black ally fell with sword cutlas musket bayonet upon european whose pistol have given decided advantage over slave who must not stand charge of marine seaman pursued for little distance when beyond range of light of stockade lieutenant playford halted slave however continued pursuit for time then too returned having overtaken killed many of flying enemy there be nothing more to be done till daylight mr playford said indeed think that will hear more of fellow who to do justice fought well gun must have done good deal of execution though must have done much more have not be so close bullet have hardly begun to scatter however will see in morning be lucky that armed slave must have gone very hard with see have half men at gun others be too thinly scattered along line to be able to defend against so determined attack expect never calculated on slave being armed thought that have only forty fifty men to deal with after lesson that have have think will molest again unless there be troop in neighbourhood that can bring up palisade be recrossed sentry set grog be served out to seaman marine slave be mad with delight danced sang song of triumph for time a soon however a lieutenant motioned to return to hut did so at once many of be wounded more le severely seemed to think nothing of being too much pleased with vengeance have taken to care aught for pain nat prepared to return to schooner with men none of whom be however seriously hurt a have be held in reserve altogether three sailor marine have be killed six severely wounded be going on board mr playford will stay ashore till morning think that there be remotest chance of attack being renewed however be clearly duty to stay here a soon a be daylight nat went on shore again with ten of own men ten marine hundred of slave went over ground to collect wounded learn loss of assailant wounded sailor have be carried into fort when fight ceased six spaniard nine mulatto lay dead on earthen rampart at foot of palisade of be pierced in several place by pike mutilated with blow of ax round lay twenty plantation negro thirty others have fallen at edge of wood shattered by discharge of cannon killed in hand to hand conflict among be twelve of released slave not single white mulatto be found alive party pursued way for quarter of mile into wood here there be scattered body of assailant who have be overtaken by pursuer latter have done work thoroughly for not single man be found to be breathing when came to point beyond slave by sign apprised that have not gone returned collecting carrying down body of dead a went found on return that two trench four foot deep thirty foot long have already be dug at edge of forest a far from camp a possible in one of body of spaniard mulatto be laid in other that of negro earth be then filled in have be unpleasant job necessary one lieutenant playford said when knew that work be done whole party re entered fort in climate like place must have be uninhabitable in couple of day if have not buried in afternoon two fresh graf be made fallen sailor be reverently laid to rest in one dead slave in other water be brought up in bucket by negro from edge of creek sign of conflict on rampart at foot of palisade washed away covered with earth then matter resumed former aspect early next morning look out on cliff ran down reported that large brigantine be just entering inlet mr playford shouted news to nat will send off marine to said will remain here with blue jacket spanish flag be at once run up to peak in two three minute boat with marine came alongside greater part of sailor at once lay down on deck while few who remained on foot took off straw hat white jumper tied handkerchief round head gave a unseamanlike appearance a possible ten minute later brigantine appeared round point there be scarce breath of wind have two boat towing flag hung from mast head a nat turned glass upon exclaimed to boldero who having removed coat cap be standing by side be black flag fellow must be pretty sure of welcome must never venture to haul up in meantime gun ashore have be slued round be now pointed on spot somewhat ahead of schooner came slowly along until within four five length of latter then there be sudden shout on board followed by tremendous hubbub be clear that line of palisade surrounding hut have be noticed gun seen brigantine be crowded with men carried twelve gun in port long swivel eighteen pounder in bow there be now no longer motive for concealment marine seaman leapt to foot with cheer moment later schooner two foremost gun must alone bear on boat spoke out while almost at same moment two of on rampart sent shower of grape into boat sank immediately of crew who be uninjured swimming to brigantine contradictory order be shouted on board pirate one by one gun on port side answered on rampart get ready lad nat shouted will be alongside directly impetus of schooner way be indeed sufficient to take slowly surely forward pirate slightly changed course so a to bring outside schooner playford saw what object be remaining gun poured charge of grape across deck of brigantine committing terrible havoc before must be loaded again be alongside schooner so covered by from fire of gun on shore a vessel came abreast of other at distance of two three foot only nat young marine officer leapt on to pirate deck followed by men resistance of pirate be desperate although have suffered much loss from fire of gun be still numerically stronger than assailant fighting a did with desperation of despair not only held ground pushed assailant back towards bulwark illustration gun on rampart send shower of grape into pirate for three four minute fight continued without marked advantage to party pistol of seaman pirate musket of marine be empty be fighting hand to hand then slowly advantage turned against pirate issue be still undecided when there be loud cheer mr playford with fifteen sailor leapt on deck of pirate from other side approach of boat having be unnoticed in heat of fray pirate now broke captain have fallen outnumbered hopeless threw down arm while others jumped overboard who surrendered be at once bound battened down in hold of schooner eight ten only gained opposite shore took to wood victory have not be bloodless one five of frigate crew have be killed there be few among command who be not more le severely wounded be sharp fight mr glover mr playford said be indeed sir at one time fairly drove back think that must have beaten even if have not brought help to be sure must lieutenant said warmly must see a boarded that although men in front be fighting hard in rear be hanging back a if have have enough of still might have lost more men than did before finished with if have not turned up see fighting with pirate be quite different thing from fighting with other opponent fellow know well enough that there be mercy for that have nothing before to fight until die to be tried hanged veriest coward must fight till last with such alternative a before must rather fight hundred fifty french spanish seaman than hundred pirate be fine roomy craft that have taken think will now be able to carry off black doubt will be close pack for for short voyage will not matter now let see to wounded after be done can get off hatch have look round below of course may have come in here for water be likely that have at least booty in hold proved to be case be half full of good of more le valuable kind by mark on bale box have evidently formed part of cargo of three ship two day later orpheus be seen returning along coast nat be at once sent off by lieutenant with written report of what have taken place since have sailed gig reached side of frigate just a anchor be let go see right arm be in sling mr glover captain said a handed report so suppose that have have fighting yes sir have have pretty sharp fighting what be wound only chop with cutlas sir oh came to hand to hand work did nat gave answer for captain have opened report be now running eye down very satisfactory said a handed to first lieutenant attacking force handsomely repulsed pirate captured very good work indeed very good see mr boldero be wounded mr glover yes sir be hit on head with pistol shot fortunately ball glanced off skull be stunned for time be now nearly again here be work for dr bemish captain said mr playford report that ten of case be serious be going ashore in gig at once will take with have better send cutter at once mr hill to bring off wounded may a well return in own boat mr glover mr curtis can go in charge of cutter mr needham can go with nat at once returned to boat be overtaken by captain gig when half way up inlet rowed to schooner while gig made straight for landing place where lieutenant be standing congratulate mr playford captain said a stepped ashore seem to have have pretty busy time of since have be away certainly did not think must attempt to attack when have gun in position did not reckon on pirate be fine brigantine schooner look quite small beside yes sir be over three hundred ton broadside gun be twelve pounder carry eighteen pounder a swivel have crew of seventy men of whom only eight ten got ashore rest be accounted for except twelve who be in iron below credit of capturing sir really belongs to mr glover for although went off to assistance must have taken without aid though pirate be still fighting strongly well have be very successful business altogether mr playford capture of brigantine be specially fortunate a have failed to come across native craft a have hoped to do with extra accommodation will be able to manage to carry off slave see by account that mr glover have marine a well a own twenty men yes sir sent lieutenant boldero fourteen marine on board have lost six killed seriously wounded in attack here own have hardly calculated upon brigantine getting alongside schooner thought that when have smashed up boat made certain must do must be so completely at mercy that being becalmed must haul down flag have sufficient way on to take alongside schooner captain put there so cleverly must not fire at except through schooner saw at once that whole position be changed for if have captured schooner might have put men into boat made dash for shore a have so few men fit for work must have be awkward though with aid of black have doubt must have driven off then suppose discharge of grape did not do very much harm not so much a ought to have done sir see first two gun fired destroyed boat other gun be too weakly handled to be trained on pirate a forged ahead a far a must see not one of did serious execution among crew yesterday told off four negro to gun kept at work day learning how to train under direction of sailor if have thought of before must have swept deck with such effect that when got alongside schooner mr glover party must have have easy work of must hardly think of everything mr playford certainly did right in sending marine off to schooner directly have news that brigantine be entering inlet doubt if have wished to sink must have be better to have kept on shore to help work gun a be valuable prize wanted badly to help carry away slave be quite right not to try to damage say be half full of plunder yes sir there be nearly eight hundred pound in money thirty four watch jewellery found in captain cabin be valuable capture must think admiral must buy into service be just sort of craft that want schooner must be too small to tackle one of heavily armed pirate with crowd of men so slave fought well that did sir if have be daylight doubt whether of white who led attack must have escaped of course have particular animosity against negro believe that must have followed white mulatto half across island well do think that two craft will carry slave hardly sir schooner can stow hundred fifty of course will be close work there will be room for number to lie down with hatch open will be right by rearranging cargo bit two hundred must sleep in hold of brigantine must still leave rather over one hundred fifty well must give up part of hold of frigate to captain said there be help for there be about number of woman child be there not yes sir have better go off in frigate then of course prisoner will be sent off too will pay visit to brigantine then go off will send boat in a soon a get there may a well be getting men on board at once a soon a be off will of course set fire to shed here may a well send off boat load of store suitable for to frigate will of course victual two craft will send forty men to fill up vacancy have be caused to furnish crew for brigantine of of course will take command schooner will keep in close company marine will return to ship mr needham will be second on brigantine how about gun sir be old piece scarcely worth carrying away yes wo leave here to be used for defending place again have better take off carriage spike get into boat heave overboard well out in deep water do think that will be able to get everything done before dark mr playford yes sir be only nine o'clock now if will send strong working party in addition to who will be taking slave on board to help with store gun have doubt that will be able to get work done well before sunset very well mr hill will come on shore a soon a return to frigate work went on without ceasing day pinnace have be recovered repaired before frigate sailed launch went backwards forward to frigate with woman child store while boat of brigantine schooner carried men to craft a soon a store for voyage bale of cotton other good must be useful have be taken off when two large boat have finished work be employed in carrying out gun have before slave embarked be brought down by to edge of water by three o'clock be finished last boat load of sailor rowed out to prize after having set fire to hut be soon in blaze to delight of negro who danced shouted for joy half of be sent below at once a crowded deck to extent a to render impossible for sailor to work who remained be ranged in row by bulwark from end to end of craft then anchor be got up sail dropped sheeted home wind be very light be sufficient to give steerage way with british ensign flying at peak two vessel sailed out of inlet joined frigate began to make sail a soon a be seen issuing from narrow mouth glad indeed be on board three vessel when after voyage unmarked by adventure entered port royal for although negro feeling confident that be in good hand have be docile obedient be still terribly in way though have be made to take bath morning odour in crowded prize be almost overpoweringly strong on arrival negro be landed lodged in large government storehouse near fort be presented with ten yard of cloth on leaving for shore be before being housed permitted to sort so that family friend might be together interpreter explained to that must be impossible to send back to friend in africa that must be apportioned out among plantation of island wage be to receive be explained to be told that government official must visit plantation in turn must listen to complaint might be made a to food treatment at end of three year who wished must either change master take up piece of land build hut cultivate on own account poor creature be well satisfied with be overjoyed at being united to relation friend to know that must still be together be assured that must be well cared for in time be a much own master a if at village in africa schooner be sold brigantine be a captain have expected bought into service mr playford be offered accepted command of mr normandy took place a second lieutenant of orpheus mr marston received promotion post of third officer a cerf be name of brigantine be to be considered a tender of frigate on board be still borne on book curtis glover be appointed to with petty officer forty men pirate be tried executed with exception of one who be mere lad have asserted be forced to join pirate being spared by when rest of comrade have be murdered a have lost cook mate required someone to fill place however must not have saved life have not promised to lead new captor to chief rendezvous of pirate have so long eluded search have be made for acknowledged however that be not acquainted with exact position have sailed in out four five time have only general idea of position asserted that must certainly know island if saw fortnight after reaching port royal frigate brigantine sailed in company indication given by boy pointed to island lying short distance off northern coast of venezuela there be originally said four vessel working together three brigantine large schooner one of have arrived from france only short time before cerf sailed on last voyage entrance to pirate stronghold be on south side of island be said so well concealed vessel might sail past place thousand time without noticing there be two battery at water edge inside entrance mounting twelve eighteen pounder gun have be taken from prize channel here be not more than fifty yard across very heavy boom be at time swung across just above battery be opened only when one of craft entered left there be however said spot on outer side of island where landing must be effected at little ravine that ran down to shore be thickly wooded large tree growing at mouth almost hid from passing vessel at other point shore be steep there be so much vegetation on ledge where tree bush must obtain foothold from sea must seem that cliff be not too steep to scale prisoner have be placed on board cerf a soon a be fairly at sea be altered a far a possible in appearance by white band with port painted along side false stem of entirely different shape from own be fastened to light upper spar sent down replaced by stumpy one other change made must help to alter appearance be recognized by pirate a sailed past island must at once be suspected that one of men recently captured have revealed rendezvous that be cruising near to obtain exact idea of best mode of attack before other craft came up to assist have doubt that pirate have already received news of surprise capture of brigantine of men who escaped must doubtless have made for nearest port hired negro craft to take to own island must have reached before orpheus arrived at port royal with prize pirate must therefore be on guard must either have deserted head quarter altogether have added to defence sight of late consort must confirm fear that whereabouts have become known be therefore of importance that identity must not be suspected changed a now be might be taken for man of war brigantine height out of water have be increased by four foot by painted canvas fastened to batten have ten port painted on side looked very different craft from smart brigantine have sailed away from island have at first be suggested by mr playford that must be disguised so a to look like trader captain crosbie have decided against there be said three of pirate even two of might together be more than match for by account be of a strong a be in point of armament must carry at least twice a many men a have even if beat off must only be at very great cost of life certainly must not like to undertake such enterprise unless have at least double strength of men must not spare by going in guise of vessel of war must not care to meddle with must know that there must be chance of booty certainty of hard fighting of getting own craft badly knocked about so that will be in respect best to avoid fight may in case not connect with at take to be freshly arrived craft have best hoist star stripe a pas along coast when change be effected ship parted company brigantine be to sail east until within short distance of grenada then to cruise westward along coast of mainland thus going there must be le suspicion on part of who saw that be coming from jamaica rendezvous be appointed at island of oruba lying off mouth of gulf of venezuela prisoner be french be very closely questioned by lieutenant playford who spoke that language well said that always sailed north to begin with then sometimes kept east certainly heard name of guadeloupe st lucia at other time after sailing north steered north west came to great island have doubt be san domingo be not in craft that sailed be only transferred to with of others for cruise only after have once made western island san domingo cruised about in direction great point be mr playford said to midshipman after long talk with prisoner at starting generally hung about island guadeloupe st lucia so on for time be considered best cruising ground though also most dangerous one a have always cruiser in water must certainly place island somewhere off north coast of caracas declared that first day out generally passed western point of island of considerable size with high hill only island answer to account be a see in chart margarita therefore feel convinced that pirate hold be in one of group off caracas chimana borrshcha two islet called piritu island altogether see there be over dozen of island scattered along near mainland be quite out of general course of trade a nothing must go into bay except craft bound for san diego place marked barcelona lying short distance up river must take care not to molest of little trader frequenting port might lie in inlet in one of island for year without being ever suspected unless perhaps by of native fisherman who probably supply with fish fruit from mainland anyhow suppose british cruiser be seen along coast once year chapter v pirate hold fortnight later cerf passed along under easy sail between island of margarita mainland be now getting very close to spot where if prisoner be right pirate hold lay star stripe be hanging from peak with high bulwark ten port on side one must have suspected that be not a seemed american man of war heavily armed passing close to island headed more south into bay a neared caracas foot of island be closely scanned five mile farther came abreast of chimana isle pointing to one of lay shore than others prisoner exclaimed that be certain that be island be sure of exclaimed from look of island from high range of mountain on mainland to south east be quite sure certain captain there be large tree spoke of growing down close to water be behind that there be little ravine by one can climb up alteration be made in ship course continued way until sunset when dropped anchor off mouth of river la pasqua twenty mile west of island a soon a be dark curtis be sent off in gig manned by six rower oar be muffled order be to row round island within oar length of shore to find entrance to channel if prisoner be right a to place must be on side facing mainland pierre french lad be taken with be long row to island gig be fast one at three o'clock in morning returned with news that pierre information have be correct have found opening have not entered a mr playford have given strict order on point thinking probable that there must be sharp look out kept in battery especially a supposed cruiser must certainly have be closely watched a passed hour later anchor be got up cerf sailed for oruba off arrived three day later there be sign of frigate indeed cerf have arrived at rendezvous before time fixed at daybreak on third morning topsail of orpheus be made out from mast head four hour later cerf met mr playford went on board frigate to report be good news indeed captain said when heard that haunt of pirate have be discovered of course have taken exact position of island for must if possible take by surprise yes sir lie a nearly a possible in deg west longitude deg ' north latitude will lay course east mr playford for of course will keep company with water be deep all along coast there seems to be from thirty to thirty eight fathom to within mile two of coast will lay course outside windward island a far a blanquilla thence almost due south course will take clear of western point of margarita down to island will discus plan of attack later on on morning of third day after leaving oruba island of blanquilla be sighted frigate made signal for mr playford to go on board on entering captain cabin found mr hill examining chart see mr playford be now a nearly a possible hundred mile north of island with wind must pas point of margarita at about four o'clock in afternoon if freshens will take in sail want to be off island say three four hour before daybreak will send french lad on board when go back a soon a anchor will go in gig with mr hill to reconnoitre make sure that there be mistake about place when find that be all right will come back boat will be in water men on board in readiness will at once start so that landing may if possible be effected just at daybreak at ravine on north of island at same hour will sail in take up place opposite mouth of harbour fight anything try to come out be quite possible that a soon a party attack place on land side craft there may be there will cut cable try to make off on account try to enter battery must blow out of water will start a soon a boat leave ship will therefore have light enough for to go in to avoid making mistake for see there be dozen island lying close together there be objection to seeing indeed must be rather glad if do for in case be le likely to discover landing party though must see frigate will think that be only lying there to cut off if try to escape will be manning battery getting everything ready to give warm reception hope that will drop upon a if out of cloud mr hill will command landing party will consist of hundred fifty seaman thirty marine with advantage of surprise ought to be sufficient a report that island be le than mile long not much more than mile across landing party will soon be at work after have landed mr hill will divide into two party will endeavour to make way round inlet keeping up among tree then rush down upon battery when have captured will fire three gun a signal to will have boat in readiness will at once tow schooner in on reaching boom bring broadside to bear upon craft there generally aid landing party with gun if by good luck three craft have be so long looking for be there will have strong force to tackle may certainly take that crew will together mount up to three hundred men be likely that there may be hundred others who form what may call garrison of place when be away very well sir two vessel headed south under easy canvas passed point of margarita at hour have be arranged then taking in still more sail proceeded slowly on until about one o'clock in morning island must be made out with night glass then be laid to captain crosbie having forbidden anchoring in first place owing to great depth of water in next because although island be three mile away chain cable running out might be heard at night if pirate have anyone on watch on hill nat whose watch be saw gig shoot away from side of frigate hour later there be bustle stir on board orpheus boat be lowered at five bell crew began to take place in soon afterwards gig returned watch below be called up sail be made at half past three boat started cerf be headed towards land dawn be just breaking when reached island be still have be arranged that unless discovered attack on battery be not to be made until five o'clock just at hour cerf arrived off narrow entrance to port hour before musket have be discharged on hill above be clear that coming have be observed a sound of conflict must be heard inland there be reason to suppose that pirate have suspicion of landing having be effected on other side be what call being punctual nat said to curtis a two bell rang out just a opened passage light kedge anchor be dropped a be done patter of musketry broke out from hill above action showed that arrival of brigantine be matter of chance that be there expressly with intention of attacking pirate stronghold who have be watching therefore saw that further attempt at concealment be useless in night canvas band have be taken down a there be longer reason for concealing identity of brigantine musketry fire only lasted for minute for suddenly roar of battle broke out within hundred yard of mouth of entrance sailor burst into loud cheer be evident that landing party have met with complete success so far have approached battery unobserved that hand to hand fight be going on above cracking of pistol cheer of seaman must be plainly heard in two three minute uproar died away then three gun be fired at short interval boat be already in water kedge lifted crew bending forward in readiness for signal take in lieutenant shouted schooner head at once began to turn towards inlet moment later two broadside be fired there be two of craft in there curtis exclaimed now fellow have carried battery have opened fire on a spoke there be broadside be answered by hurrah from on deck be clear that have have good luck to catch pirate at once three minute rowing boom be in sight mr playford called to one of boat to take rope from stern to battery on right hand side ordered others to cease rowing have way enough on shouted a soon a get near boom take head round to port carry rope to shore can fasten to chain at end of boom a gave order gun spoke out from battery on right followed almost immediately by one on left be slueing gun round nat exclaimed will be having share of fun in minute two must now obtain view into piece of water inside passage be nearly circular three hundred yard across two brigantine schooner be lying in line within fifty yard of opposite shore large range of storehouse stood by water edge while hillside be dotted with hut dwelling place of larger size by time that brigantine be got into position by side of boom pirate have loaded again several shot struck gun be already loaded on board poured broadside into brigantine at end of line sailor in battery be working with might main to slue gun round to bear upon pirate on hillside above scattered fire of musketry be being kept up mr hill hailed schooner mr playford will land party of fifteen men on side to clear hill of rascal think there be many of be doing good deal of damage for can hardly miss closely packed a be here ay ay sir hear order gentleman mr curtis land with fifteen men on starboard side do mr glover take party land to port clear scoundrel out give quarter boat have just returned two midshipman leapt into few stroke took ashore up hill lad nat shouted fire until be at close quarter give one volley if be together then sling gun go at with cutlas there be little fighting however for there be only ten twelve pirate on side a main force be distributed between battery ship be therefore very easily driven off five six of being killed rest flying with speed towards village where who have escaped from battery be already going off in boat to ship two midshipman therefore returned to schooner come on board mr playford shouted see if can free one end of boom if so will go in engage one of craft be found that boom be fastened at nat side chain be soon unwound from stump of large tree then two boat together got hold of end of boom swung round so that schooner must pas enemy kept up heavy fire upon while be doing just a job be completed curtis boat be smashed to piece by round shot breeze be very light be in right direction will tow sir nat called to commander certainly not get men on board at once sail have be loosely furled be dropped again brigantine stole past battery saluted with rousing cheer while gun be worked with redoubled energy to keep down fire of pirate cerf be swept with round shot grape by gun of three piratical craft distance to be traversed be so small fire from battery to pirate working gun be exposed be so heavy that men fired wildly cerf suffered le than might have be expected while crossing intervening two hundred yard of water be steered straight for schooner a bowsprit ran in between pirate mast crew who have be crouching forward leapt down on to deck headed by commander two midshipman pirate although have suffered heavily be still in sufficient force to offer efficient resistance courage have be shaken by suddenness of attack have lain down to sleep with assurance that port be unknown unsuspected that battery guarded must sink hostile ship attempted to enter dismay when battery be attacked carried by enemy who seemed to spring out of earth only retreat cut off be overwhelming already heavy gun of battery have done terrible execution two of gun on side have be dismounted third of crew killed consequently although small portion of number led by captain fought desperately be killed to last man majority leapt overboard at once swam ashore leaving ten men in charge of prize lieutenant called rest back on board cerf remained in position in have run head on to schooner be now able to bring broadside into play upon brigantine piece forward raking from stem to stern while battery continued terrible fire in few minute pirate began to take to boat be lying by side just a have come off from shore once begun movement spread rapidly boat be soon crowded who must not find place in leapt overboard take boat dozen men mr curtis haul down black flag of craft to starboard mr glover take one of prize boat do same to other brigantine turned to execute order when on board cerf be hurled to deck one of brigantine have blown up with tremendous explosion brought most of hut on hillside to ground carried away mast of cerf drove fragment of wreckage high into air whence fell partly in pool partly on shore fortunately for cerf only few fragment of size struck deck piece for most part falling in wider circle number of pirate who have just landed from boat be killed many more be injured by being hurled down on to rock dazed half stunned on board cerf who have escaped severe injury rose to foot not more than twenty five did so lieutenant playford lay dead crushed under mast curtis have be hurled against one of gun brain dashed out ten of sailor have be killed either by falling mast by being dashed against bulwark twelve have fallen under enemy fire a cerf crossed pool twelve others be hurt more le either by enemy missile by shock be three four minute before silence followed be broken then mr hill hailed across water cerf ahoy have suffered much terribly nat shouted back lieutenant playford mr curtis be killed have only twenty five men in way fit for service left if have got boat will swim send ashore nat looked over side boat have be stove by falling fragment then crossed to prize found that one of boat be uninjured four men be just getting into when mr hill hailed again let bring rope with mr glover will tow over here end of hawser be put into boat men rowed with to battery mr glover lieutenant again hailed yes sir be sending boat back again think that have put slow match in magazine of other brigantine must have exploded before however have better remain where be for quarter of hour to be sure then before move board brigantine flood magazine otherwise a soon a have left of desperado might swim off to put match there very well sir will go at once if like there be use running unnecessary risk have better flood schooner magazine first ay ay sir taking dozen hand with bucket nat went on board prize soon flooded magazine then who be able to help did must for wounded several of whom who have only be stunned be presently on leg again when quarter of hour have passed asked for volunteer survivor stepped forward four men will be enough said bring bucket with be not without feeling of awe that nat four sailor stepped on to deck of brigantine for although be convinced that have match be lighted explosion must have taken place long before a be now five twenty minute since crew have deserted neither men have entirely recovered from severe shock of explosion led way below be quiet door of magazine be open there be smell of burning powder entered fearlessly all right lad now a quick a like with bucket abundance of water be thrown in then to make quite certain nat locked door of magazine put key in pocket cheer broke from men in battery a companion again took place in boat rowed to cerf be hailed again by mr hill have changed mind mr glover now that know there be risk of explosion think perhaps have best remain where be will give pull to get free of schooner then have better range cerf alongside of keep gun of brigantine loaded with grape send boat ashore to fetch off wounded have two boat now sir one of brigantine be left behind be uninjured then send ashore sooner get wounded off better be going to move forward with men have spiked gun here if must come down into battery again can clear out will of course help if meet with strong resistance with gun on shore side ay ay sir two boat be sent ashore wounded came off with dr bemish a soon a came on board nat said will leave with wounded here doctor with four of men to help be so littered up that must hardly work gun a see three of be dismounted by explosion besides prize alongside must hamper therefore will take rest of men on board brigantine think will be very good plan lad doctor replied quite agree with with spar wreckage on one side prize on other be practically helpless men be at once set to work bringing up powder cartridge from magazine grape round shot must find on board brigantine in ten minute gun of craft be reloaded two body of men from battery have by time reached storehouse not shot have be fired minute later there be loud word of command followed by fierce yell in moment party be engaged heavy fire being opened upon from spot of vantage on hillside in front of now lad give dose of grape nat shouted expect be two to one to fellow still train carefully gun after gun sent shower of grape

heard on board frigate there be longer motive for remaining at distance head have be turned to island boat have met mile away from entrance after reading note captain crosbie sent one of gig to order boat round to inlet proceeded in own boat to investigate state of affair ordering cerf boat to row ahead of frigate be to work in under very reduced sail sounding a went be if water be deep enough to anchor off mouth of cove then found pirate here mr hill captain said a landed yes sir blew up one of craft when left yes of course heard report shook frigate a if have struck on rock must have be tremendous here yes sir must have have immense deal of powder in magazine shock be something terrible although be over there in battery one of be thrown to ground several be killed two of gun be

division mr hill what be casualty took battery almost without loss sir in duel with pirate lost in two battery fourteen killed nine more be killed by explosion sent eighteen off to cerf seriously wounded a to contusion minor hurt must say that there be not man who escaped well well be heavy bill indeed forty eight men killed two officer why must probably have lost le in action against frigate of own size however have destroyed nest of pirate have captured three of four ship other be blown up now what be state of thing here there be believe hundred fifty two hundred of pirate still on island be divided into two party last firing heard be when rushed down into battery thinking doubt to take revenge by sinking brigantine two prize mr glover opened fire upon with grape with great effect when got into battery found that have spiked gun did when left thinking might make just move sent off to sir in order that storehouse building might be held while cleared wood on one side down to mouth of cove when have done that can do same on other side did have casualty in taking village several wounded sir none killed mr glover drove out with grape so rendered work comparatively easy be sorry to say that almost last shot fired by hit mr needham high up in left arm doctor came ashore few minute ago after attending to wounded sent on board cerf examined arm tell that bone be completely smashed that must amputate half way between elbow shoulder be bad indeed however be better than if have be right arm mr harpur said captain to midshipman who have come ashore with take gig off meet boat tell launch pinnace to go alongside frigate request mr normandy to send mr marston ashore with fifty more men what on earth be to do with poor creature went on to first lieutenant a gig rowed away of course must take to jamaica be terrible position doubt have be captured in prize villain have taken most of must have seen husband father murdered before eye of may have be here long enough to become accustomed to lot many of may have be captured lately what be to become of know have not opened of storehouse yet sir have be pretty busy see cut down cactus hedge round hut high up on hill so a to keep pirate from working down making fresh attack upon a to other house have given strict order one be to enter men have piled arm be lying down by many of have not completely recovered from shock of explosion be bruised more le by being hurled on to rock against gun fancy doctor will have hand full for many day well must pick out twenty so from most fit for duty can join men sent for finish business rest can be on guard here in case party on other side take into head to make attack chapter vi negro rising while waiting for arrival of reinforcement captain crosbie went on board cerf wounded have be carried below where cot have be slung for after wound be dressed went round saying few word to enquiring into nature of injury attempt have be made to remedy confusion on deck except that body of must be moved have be laid side by side that of mr playford others who have be crushed by falling mast still lay beneath a four men left on board be unable to do anything to extricate until help arrived captain then went on board prize mr hill have spoken in highest term of service that have rendered mr glover though have not yet heard full detail a only surviving officer of cerf have better when have time draw out full report for of work done by will be half hour before again commence operation against pirate will be obliged if will go on board cerf with men endeavour to get body of mr playford others from underneath mast nothing more can be done at present be painful that must be lying there fancy that with hand spike will have very great difficulty in raising butt of mast high enough to draw body from under a soon a have done that bring men back here when advance begin will shell wood ahead of will put ashore first sir be only boat have will float captain crosbie on landing went among woman who be between seventy eighty in number burst into tear when spoke to others seemed dazed quite unconscious that be being addressed feeling almost unmanned by moving spectacle captain crosbie be relieved when two boat filled with men entered mouth of cove a soon a came alongside men leapt out in high spirit at prospect of having share in fray mr hill have already picked out twenty of own party will myself take command here mr hill wish to interfere with credit that will gain by affair therefore leave arrangement of party in hand mr hill marched seventy men straight up hill will march straight on mr marston until reach edge of cliff then will return see that men be placed at regular interval will then face to right line will advance quarter will be given except to men who throw down arm beg for suppose that many will do so a know what fate will be if be taken to port royal have reason to believe that there can not be more than eighty so on side if keep in body make rush at line will doubt be able to break through however that must risk hardly think that will attempt for know that must sooner later fall into hand will only starve if conceal may prefer death in way may think that after have left may manage to get taken across to mainland in native fishing boat however search ground closely men be steeped in blood have be scourge of sea for past five six year have never yet shown mercy mr hill then placed in centre of line while mr marston again took place on right be not until have worked round nearly to entrance that opposition be met with then came upon spot where mass of rock cropped up among tree a approached sharp fire of musketry broke out mr hill ordered two end of line to advance so a to form semicircle round rock when be in position gave word to charge with cheer sailor dashed forward led by officer scrambled up rock like cat discharged musket into pirate grouped on summit then threw upon cutlas in hand in three minute be over not man asked for mercy died fighting desperately to end four of sailor be killed several severely wounded be carried helped down to shore rest of party then scattered through wood closest search failed to discover single man in hiding although only fifty of have be accounted for returning to point from have started party then proceeded to search forest at other side of cove here however met with resistance few dead be found forest be deserted after searching in vain for time be concluded that survivor have probably gone down face of cliff hidden there in cave in thicket in place must only be reached by men well acquainted with ground after two hour vain search mr hill led party down to shore again while have be away captain have have storehouse opened be filled with booty of kind plunder of at least fifty ship a judged by chronometer mark on bale other article here be thousand of case of wine range of barrel of rum hogshead of sugar coffee other colonial produce

good spirit be sure to give step said to glover will have served time in six month marston rank will of course be confirmed now that poor playford death have made vacancy permanent have year to serve have not glover yes rather more however of course affair will help too a soon a have passed ought to old fellow considering be only officer left on board cerf that unfastened boom under tremendous fire to say nothing of carrying schooner running risk of being blown up when went on board brigantine will get swab a soon a have passed see have be big thing fifty eight men killed hundred four put down a wounded breaking up of pirate nest make most important affair there have be out here for year other ship on station will feel quite jealous of there will be goodish bit of prize money too be not to be despised over eighty thousand pound in gold must say over twenty thousand pound in good make even midshipman share something considerable how be arm glover well have be hurting bit be not conscious of having used particularly suppose when be thrown down by explosion must have got wrenched somehow well if be must ask dr bemish to have look at did so be black blue from shoulder down to elbow very tender to touch think anything be broken doctor said have be very close shave at rate be just a well that must put on splint bandage must take to sling again keep to for time be not tender above shoulder be doctor think be all right there be lucky ought to go on sick list can not do sir must be giving up command of brigantine must put up with anything rather than that have fine weather leading wind to jamaica arrival there with two captured prize news that piratical haunt have be completely destroyed created quite sensation be heightened by rescue of so many female from hand of pirate fifteen of found friend in island scene when be handed over to be painful in extreme third of number be french there be also eighteen spaniard be temporarily taken in cared for by family at port royal be sent off a soon a opportunity offered to island for have be bound when captured to friend in europe mr hill in report have done full justice to work done by cerf have mentioned nat going on board brigantine to drown magazine great service that have rendered in covering advance of sailor by gun of craft in inflicting such heavy punishment upon two party have attempted to posse of battery admiral sent for personally congratulated on work will see that a soon a have passed mr glover will have commission a acting lieutenant have not forgotten what captain crosbie told of gallant action at cape francois mr hill be at once appointed to command of frigate whose captain have died of yellow fever received rank of commander pending confirmation from home mr philpot second

thousand pound larger sum than have ever be captured by vessel on station new brigantine be re christened falcon mr low be placed in command with two midshipman from other ship on station under be not like cerf tender to orpheus a frigate must no longer spare crew for having in addition to loss in action be obliged to send thirty men to hospital on brigantine be therefore manned by draft from other ship of war on station needham be also left on shore being promoted at once to rank of lieutenant left nat for time senior midshipman of orpheus be now directed to cruise in neighbourhood of hayti where complaint have be received of vessel being missing two month after leaving jamaica orpheus again put in to cape francois nat be still wearing arm in sling there have be good deal of swelling inflammation have now abated in opinion arm be perfectly well again doctor insisted that must a precautionary measure still use sling frigate needed repair having carried away spar in hurricane week previously on day of arrival captain sent for nat said kindly will be here for week mr glover doctor think that run among hill will do good therefore can go stay with friend there until sail again if return day week will do have stuck to work well for doctor bemish said that for first month at least ought to have be on sick list at rate deserve holiday for share in fight on landing nat went first to monsieur duchesne office planter have just driven in horse trap be still standing at door negro driver gave friendly grin a saw glad to see sah bery glad eberyone will be glad hope well sah thank caesar well at plantation hope went into office where be most warmly received by monsieur duchesne have be told that ship came into port at daybreak dear monsieur glover must have come off to ask after a soon a have answered letter to carry off if captain must give leave see arm be still in sling have not hurt hope hurt in fight have with pirate dare say heard of everyone have heard of planter said be splendid there be not one here who doe not feel grateful indeed to ship for having rid of scoundrel who have be doing so much harm for year have not hurt much hope be bad for bit be all right again now doctor order to keep to sling for time longer though be sure there be not least necessity for now about leave will go off to ship think captain gave leave morning for week without even asking for be good news indeed carriage be at door fortunately told caesar to wait a there be thing to take back wife myra will be delighted to see talk of always will be glad indeed to have with again boy have gone out to buy matter required by madame will be back in few minute quarter of hour later nat be on way out to plantation where be received with welcome of warmest kind by madame duchesne daughter be greatly concerned at finding that arm have again be injured be hard indeed myra said must be so well strong again that must still be suffering for what did for think said that business have really anything to do with last one pirate ship blew up close to shock be tremendous mast of brigantine be in snapped off a if have be carrot everyone on deck be thrown down twelve be killed outright rest of be great deal bruised hurt doctor said that thought arm might very well have be broken even have not be for accident a came off better than most of others certainly have reason to complain be really quite well again now can use for almost purpose consider absurd must wear sling must take off at once only doctor made promise must generally wear indeed on board always took arm out when wanted to use said that certain amount of exercise be good for monsieur duchesne came home a usual just at sunset nat noticed that at dinner be evidently preoccupied though endeavoured to join in conversation a cheerily a usual after lady have left table said may have noticed that be distrait monsieur glover be anxious time for of on island have be so indeed for time see be divided into three class there be pure white mulatto negro even be subdivided there be old settler men who like belong to noble french family who hope keep up best tradition of country there be poor white landless men who be discontented with position hate who be better off while stand aloof from mulatto again be equally divided many of be rich men with plantation send son daughter over to france to be educated take much amiss that who be of pure blood associate with then again there be negro who number fewer than five hundred thousand while white be forty thousand went on well enough together until state general met in france be bad affair that for a well a for france from time there have be ferment sent over deputy eighteen of assembly only allowed six to take seat while snubbed young mulatto be treated with greatest favour then came news that assembly have passed declaration asserting men to be free equal may imagine what shock be to of mulatto in excitement took up arm to show that be free be easily put down however when national assembly heard of excitement dissatisfaction caused among french in colony made decree authorizing colony to elect own legislative assembly assembly here lost head on finding power in hand passed constitution practically renounced allegiance to france riot broke out thing must have be very serious have not on eleventh of october last year decree be passed by national assembly modifying former one however on fifteenth of may passed declaring people of colour in french colony born of free parent entitled to vote for member of colonial assembly to be elected to seat when news came here six week ago can imagine excitement meeting be held be even proposed to throw off allegiance to france to hoist british flag instead of ours happily calmer thought came matter cooled down there can be doubt that state of affair be critical mulatto who outnumber white know how to contain with joy dispute between white take place daily then there be negro see decree doe nothing for be hard to know what negro think even whether care that be not to have vote be not known to be clear that must be of little advantage to see one who be not out of mind must think of giving vote to for vote must be five time a large a of white mulatto together must have assembly composed entirely of slave slave must at once vote that land property in island must be divided among what think of monsieur glover must be madness indeed nat agreed then see even if did not do that must declare free must be ruined sapristi make one blood cold to think of thing nevertheless negro be like child can be led by little talk among there be men of intelligence who must work rest up to state of madness say that will come heaven defend from calamity still monsieur will comprehend that feel a if be sitting on edge of volcano such strange thing happen what may not occur next will understand talk of thing before wife child of course know about past a for future trouble at have spoken to of friend laugh at idea of slave rising say truly enough that be far better treated here than in british colony then there have be revolution in england people have not be stirred up to state of excitement nation have not lost head a in france say that be possible there may be trouble with slave not here surely monsieur negro seem to to be contented happy be sure be well treated be undoubtedly so a told negro be like child will laugh one minute scream with rage next there be never saying what may do can hardly bring to think that thing must happen have taken to carrying pistol in pocket have stored arm in closet in hall at least must have handy doubt not that house servant will remain true hope many of slave be for have gathered arm together surely must have warning at first whisper must of course drive wife child down to town where must be safe for there white be strong have fear of attack however must trust that thing may never happen that if doe may be in far distance come when will everyone must receive warning in plenty of time to make preparation seems to impossible that plot of magnitude must be passed from end to end of island be known to so vast number of negro without of warning master of danger for there be ten of thousand who be almost like member of master family must say be quite impossible that extensive plot must be hatched without being known in very short time to everyone nat agreed in case although who live far in interior of island might have reason to fear must negro break out can hardly think that within little more than hour drive from city need feel uneasiness feel that there ought to be trouble here at rate unless there be successful insurrection in other part of island doubt must be infectious elsewhere negro near town must be last to join in such movement for might be sure that white there must take speedy vengeance on within reach however let think more of at present wife myra will be wondering what can find to talk about so long nat lay awake for time night thinking of what monsieur duchesne have said have heard vaguely while be there before of manner in revolution in france have affected island be subject be little discussed at planter having feeling prejudice of old noblesse of france have from first be opposed to popular movement in paris have held altogether aloof from demonstration on island subject be painful to have seldom alluded to in family circle seemed to nat inconceivable that general movement must be planned among black without warning being received by planter when went out next day looked with more attention than before at slave working on plantation seemed to that demeanour be quieter than usual mulatto overseer seemed to pay le attention to be surprised to come upon three of talking earnestly together whereas hitherto have always seen on different part of estate on following morning rd of august monsieur duchesne started a usual soon after seven o'clock for heat be now intense be dangerous to be out after sun have obtained full power hour later nat be sitting in verandah behind house with madame duchesne myra when old negress ran out eye be wide open with terror excitement face be almost pale madame mambeelle must fly hide exclaimed nigger come in hour ago wid news dat slabes rise last night in many place ober de country kill de white dinah hear dat people expect dat only not for anober two day oberseers de leader now dey come here quick wid de field hand not moment to be lost fly for libes impossible madame duchesne exclaimed a myra sprang to foot alarmed incredulous may be true madame nat exclaimed for god sake run with myra in among shrubbery there will join in moment if be false alarm better may be true there be not moment to lose do hear shout burst of yell shout rose in air short distance away run run nat exclaimed a dashed into house rushed to closet in hall seized two brace of pistol sword dozen packet of cartridge for pistol then ran out into verandah just in time to see white dress of lady disappear into shrubbery close to entrance of verandah wrap sometimes put on to keep off evening dew when be sitting out of door be hung up close by hastily snatching off hook dashed off at full speed for tumult be now approaching front of house lady have stopped just within cover of bush run cried there be not moment to lose will be searching for a soon a find that be not in house belt of foliage extended round garden keeping inside ran to other end fortunately adjoining garden be plantation of sugar cane have not yet be cut for although greater portion of cane be cut in april freshly made plantation planted at time be not fit to cut until autumn of following year cane be ten foot high a row be three foot apart there be plenty of room to run between scarcely word be spoken a hurried along plantation be four hundred yard across beyond stretched of equal size extending to edge of forest cane here have be cut four month before be three foot high at other time many negro must have be at work hoeing ground round root when nat looked out cautiously from edge of higher cane not soul be to be seen think be perfectly safe said have better put on dark wrap light dress must be seen long distance away have better move short distance farther to right before attempt to go straight on if will walk one after other treading in other step will take off shoe follow will destroy trace mark of bare foot might be taken for of negro please lose moment said a saw that madame duchesne be about to speak there will be time to talk when get into forest settle what have best do have gone few yard when nat eye caught sight of hoe lying on ground short distance along one of row of young cane ran fetched others stopping while did so then a went along carefully obliterated footstep continued to do so until when after walking thirty forty yard farther turned into young plantation surface of ground be almost dust dry between row of growing cane track have be worn by foot of slave who two three day hoed round root here therefore there be occasion to use hoe a ground be so hard that foot left mark upon in few minute entered wood went in little distance then stopped must still hear yell of negro who nat doubted not be engaged in plundering house after felt sure that there must be eager search for fugitive ground have be rising way see need few minute rest said to madame duchesne who be so much shaken that be evident must walk little farther will go back to edge of wood see if there be sign of following just a reached open ground there be louder outburst than usual of exulting cry saw column of smoke rising from tree knew that negro have set house on fire returned at once to lady madame duchesne have sunk on ground myra be kneeling beside must go on madame said scoundrel have fired house rose to foot be better now said with calmness greatly pleased nat seemed dream at first what doe mean nat for a well a daughter have come to address by name fear be general rising of black throughout island replied monsieur duchesne told last night that thought event might possibly take place made sure that if occurred must have ample warning by what old nurse said must have be arranged thing to take place on twenty fifth something must have hurried think to begin with have better go mile farther into forest can talk a go have not better make straight for town think not though of course will do believe to be best there be score of plantation between town have doubt that slave will have risen everywhere besides if own negro fail to follow track will make sure that have gone in direction will be on look out for therefore think that for present have better remain in forest how can live here asked there will be difficulty about that replied there be plenty of plantation of yam can go down dig up at night young cane will quench thirst if fail to hit upon spring know that there be several of among hill for pas over five six little streamlet on way to town be sure nat will look well after myra said confidently besides mamma be certain that must not walk down there know never do walk can not recollect walking so far a have done to day indeed have be chief reason why nat have decided that have better stay in forest at present although have not mentioned like creole a white born in island be called in french west indie madame duchesne be altogether unaccustomed to exercise beyond stroll in garden when heat of day be over have not walked since childhood heat indeed rendered journey of kind next to impossible during greater part of day have slave to do bidding to wait on fetch carry consequently even in house have occasion for slightest personal exertion madame duchesne being of naturally more energetic temperament than be creole in general be le indolent than majority of lady of island be wholly incapable of taking walk of english lady must have thought nothing be already greatly exhausted by excitement fatigue of hasty flight to nat seemed at once that be hopeless for to think of attempting journey of fifteen mile across rough country forest grew thicker a advanced after walking for hour madame duchesne declared that be impossible for to go farther nat be indeed surprised that have held on for so long have be leaning on arm felt weight becoming heavier heavier step be bathed in perspiration breath came in gasp proposed halt feeling that be at end of strength chapter vii in hiding first thing to do nat said after have seen that madame duchesne be a comfortably seated a possible be to find sort of hiding place may be sure that negro will search everywhere for released from work having nothing to do will wander about wood one of might come upon at moment therefore unless can find sort of shelter dare not leave for minute why must leave myra asked must eat drink said must endeavour to discover what be going on elsewhere must if possible obtain disguise endeavour to find out what be intention of black ascertain whether will be possible to obtain help from town can begin to hing until feel that be at least comparatively safe there be doubt madame duchesne that position be very painful one have great deal to be thankful for if rising have taken place in night a doubt did at plantation where negro began work must have be murdered without chance of resistance now have escaped with life have satisfaction of knowing that monsieur duchesne be safe in town will assuredly do best to rescue that can hardly be yet cape francois be doubt in state of wild panic will in first place be thinking of how can best defend there be of course many other planter there in same position a husband will be thinking of own people nothing like general effort will be possible at rate seems to that must be time before operation can take place to put down insurrection if one must get hold of messenger one must trust must let monsieur duchesne know that be for present safe must be immense relief to so far a know at present that old nurse be only one of slave who be faithful even if must find get to carry note message be unlikely in extreme that must be permitted to pas on into town however a say first thing be to discover hiding place where must be comparatively safe before go to find messenger will look round for clump of undergrowth where nothing close search must find think that bush see across there must do for moment can not remain here for must be seen at once by anyone who came along within fifty yard of will go see at once whether must do without waiting for answer hurried away on examination found that place be more suitable than have expected great tree have once stood there have be sawn off close to ground round clump of bush have sprung up growing so thickly that be impossible to see into centre save by pushing aside bush entering little circle hastened back will do excellently for hiding place for present said sooner be inside better assisted madame duchesne to foot led to bush then bent of very carefully aside lady made way in followed seeing that of sapling fell back in natural position there madame said unless anyone took into head to push in a have done be absolutely safe will be better that must keep dark cloak on think that anyone must see through thick screen of leaf be a well to be on safe side wo leave at present certainly not said after get dark will make way down to house must get disguise of sort doe not matter much what be for expect slave will be dressing up in clothes have stolen matter what be with charred wood can blacken face hand doubt anyone must see at once on looking at closely be not negro at distance must pas must make better mulatto than must negro myra said so must a be shade of colour must not have to be very particular if have dinah here with myra said must make dye know about berry root generally doctor of woman who may be ill must know for sure of berry must stain skin well must see if can find myra if not must use charcoal certainly other must be much safer see thanks to long stay with before have got to speak french very fairly now day passed slowly occasionally heard shout lower down in forest did not come near after time died away thought must hardly come up a far a nat said negro be not given to work unless be obliged to will find so pleasant doing nothing that be hardly likely to give trouble to search very far for besides doubtless have other thing to think about will know that work have only begun when have burnt master house killed white people can lay hand upon that until have taken possession of town be not master of island doubt too carried out wine before burnt house besides myra said there be rum store there be at least hundred barrel there yes did not think of well expect that before greater part of be drunk suppose there will be sober man left to night will make easy business for to find out what be doing to get hold of thing will be useful to be more afraid of mulatto than of negro do think that must join black have doubt at about feel sure have done so saw three of talking together yesterday be paying attention to slave thought then that be rather peculiar besides know that lower class of mulatto be a hostile to white a negro be if not more so have doubt have have good deal to do with exciting slave to revolt now madame duchesne will go down through wood get sugar cane look for stream madame duchesne protested be accustomed to have want supplied a soon a expressed be suffering much from thirst after excitement effort really require something nat went on see if go down after dark may be away for two three hour be to wait till then must be in fever with thirst be evident that negro have left wood therefore there can be risk in going down cutting dozen of young cane if go said firmly sitting up a spoke must leave two of pistol be double barrelled be not yes madame well leave two if negro come begin to search place will shoot myra first then for death must be thousand time preferable to falling into hand of wretch think be right there nat said gravely if thought that there must be slightest fear of coming must not leave will not be away quarter of hour will leave jacket cap here tie handkerchief round head so must by chance come across searcher will not recognize until be close enough to silence will take sword a well a other brace of pistol will be useful for cutting down cane taking off jacket waistcoat tying handkerchief round head made way through bush then started at fast run down hill keeping however sharp look out a went a expected there be sign of black a reached edge of wood cut cane must hear sound of distant yell in direction of house brute have got at rum said if have dozen blue jacket believe must clear lot out do hope went on a started on way back will be able to lay hand on something to eat get hold of bottle two of wine madame will never be able to get on on yam sugar cane accustomed a have be to luxury myra will be right be regular young brick a neared clump of bush cried out cheerily all right madame have got cane have not caught sight of negro exclamation of relief followed madame duchesne myra be standing a entered with pistol in hand be not alarmed by footstep said for anyone who be searching for must come along slowly stealthily thought might be pursued if have be nat laughed may be very sure must not have brought way must have given dance over place then slipped away come back here know that said earnestly be nervous shaken very naturally too nat said felt very much a did when after explosion went on board other pirate to drown magazine believe that if anyone have given shout close to must have tumbled headlong down on deck think now be perfectly safe till to morrow by noise heard down by house must say that most of slave be drunk already may be sure that will not think of starting to

island in case road to town will be open to now good bye will be back a soon a can hurry said will try to be brave mind waiting because will know that be trying to get nurse of course may be difficult for to find alone good bye then said cheerfully passing through bush went rapidly down hill on reaching cane field again took off shoe did not hurry now be tremendous responsibility that have upon shoulder thought nothing of danger to of how madame duchesne daughter be to be sheltered cared for if a feared former be on edge of attack of fever might last for day so prostrate week might elapse

seated round table on be placed two three wine glass be smoking to morrow must get drunken black hog to work one said have regular search through wood everything have gone well except escape of madame gal someone must have warned house nigger agree that be in verandah behind just before came up talking with english lad of course will be found sooner later there be nowhere for to run to thing be want to find if anyone else came upon must kill at once yes will have trouble if find monti one of other men said black have be told that white must be killed be easy enough to work fellow up into frenzy be not so easy to calm down afterwards be quite aware of christophe be why did not press search to day why be not sorry to find that have got away see have arranged that when white be killed be to marry madame that paul be to take young one that be to divide place equally between three of if negro will let one called monti said expect will want to have say in business yes of course be understood doubt there will be trouble with there be saying how thing will turn out yet at rate will make sure of woman have gone into more for sake of getting girl than for anything else have made good beginning everywhere a far a have heard must remember that be only beginning even suppose white of town hing fancy will hear of presently will send over troop from france can hing against up in mountain christophe said scornfully may be other said quietly at rate there be black to deal with have risen against white when have done with need not suppose for moment that be going to work for luckily here have be order that slave be to be flogged without duchesne approving of result be that be for present master of plantation have heard that at of other place overseer a well a white have be killed order have gone through island that white including woman child be to be killed if be to come across woman when have forty fifty of black with think there must be chance of saving negro be demon when blood be up know too that have gone too far to be forgiven will believe that safety depends upon carrying out order faithfully seems to that be in rather awkward fix if take black out to morrow sha' find if do take out will be killed may find paul said yes if do will have english lad with can soon settle christophe growled well say must know how fought that hound there be report two day ago from town that have attacked red pirate stronghold taken destroyed four ship grant that a be three to one will kill one two of may go down before do so now tell frankly that a have personal interest in finding two woman have idea of running risk of getting shot in what be affair altogether reasonable help be willing to give when come to risking life in matter say thank ' others broke into torrent of savage oath well went on calmly be by mean certain that english boy must not be match for three of must not know where be must see might shoot couple of down before have time to draw pistol then will be man against man know girl have practised shooting so that odds must be other way now ask calmly be worth do propose then paul asked sulkily after long silence say that have better wait till can get hold of of black little money little flattery will go long way with can tell that have private order although most of white have to be put to death few be to be kept among two will elect president general be right that must have white woman to wait on just a white have be having black be just sort of thing will take with ignorant fool then with say ten men might search wood thoroughly find woman hide up somewhere under charge must go quietly to work few day will make difference know that ca get away men of plantation lower down have undertaken to see that white make way into town will not do to hurry negro be sure to be either sullen arrogant to morrow of when get over drink will begin to fear consequence others will be so triumphant that for time influence will be gone be best plan christophe said have longest head of three monti for time will be necessary to let black have own way nat while conversation went on have be fingering pistol indecisively blood be so fired by event of day certainty that hundred of woman child must have be murdered that must have have hesitation in shooting three mulatto down indeed have quite intended to do so in case at rate of paul christophe when learned plan advice however of other who be evidently leading spirit decided against course be unlikely that must be able to shoot three for at first shot must doubtless knock candle over besides be better that must live evidently must in way persuade great mass of negro not to trouble to search wood day must elapse before must get party together on whom must rely to spare woman take a prisoner if did so a proposed put in hut in charge of paul christophe must have fair chance of rescuing if succeeded in getting away at time be captured at rate if carried out plan must have day respite must either take madame duchesne myra good deal further into hill might even be able to get into town mulatto now began to talk of other matter how quickly insurrection must spread

dinah said a stood up to continue journey hab plenty of blanket taking one tore off strip six inch wide gave to nat then similar strip for herself now sah lay dat flat across shoulder den take de end twist dem tree four time round de handle just de right length so dat can hold dem comfor'ble bee going to do de same den not feel de weight on arm on shoulder find quite easy den nat found indeed that weight so disposed be a nothing to what have be when came entirely upon arm soon descended into little valley dinah have spoken of at once emptied rest of water out of jug use carry dat said can get plenty now wheneber want how be feeling myra nat asked presently be beginning to feel tired can hold on for bit mind about please will do very well be however limping badly after going to end of little dip crossed dividing spur presently struck other depression of dinah have spoken there be water here dinah hope have not dried up fear ob dat sah in de wet season water run here not now find farder down little valley deepened rapidly side became rocky broken to nat satisfaction presently came to spot where little rill of water flowed out from fissure in rock how much farther dinah lillie quarter ob mile side of valley closed in rapidly in few minute entered ravine where rock rose perpendicularly on side passage between being seven eight foot wide jest dere now dearie dinah said to myra who be now so exhausted that must scarce drag foot along three four minute stopped here be said nat looked round in surprise there be sign of opening in rock up dere dinah went on pointing to clump of bush growing on ledge up there dinah yes sah easy for to climb up see where dere be little step made casual observer must not have noticed be not cut hammered out of rock appeared like accidental indentation see that can climb up said how be to get litter up have idea no sah dat difficult be tinking ober only possible way be to take madame off de barrow carry up go up once twice see dat be not so hard a seems dese lower hole not deep dose higher up much deeper can get foot well into dem have better go up have look dinah nat started to ascend found that a have said be much easier than looked first four five step indeed be so willow that must not get much foothold above there be hole for foot six eight inch deep three four foot apart being hidden from sight of anyone passing below by projecting ledge beneath hole be much wider than necessary corner have be filled with earth tuft of coarse grass planted there completely hid opening from sight soon reached clump of bush behind be fissure three foot wide four foot high crawled into found that widened into cave be here able to stand up remaining motionless for minute two until eye became accustomed to dim light then saw that be of considerable height twelve foot wide about twenty foot deep be indeed admirable place of refuge felt sure that one unless previously acquainted with existence must be likely to discover went to entrance looked out myra be sitting down by side of little pool have taken shoe stocking off be bathing blistered foot be splendid place myra said certainly nobody be ever likely to find here only difficulty be to get mother up at once rejoined below difficulty dinah be that face of rock be so steep that one can not stoop forward enough to keep one balance with weight on one back only possible way can conceive be to fasten madame duchesne firmly to barrow by strip of blanket that have be using can tear several more from same blanket will want at least dozen lashing to keep firmly down then must knot other blanket to make strong rope will go up with end pull when get to top can take lower handle by holding on level with shoulder can steady thing a come up wo want to lift can pull weight up easily enough that have to do be to steady dat will do bery well sah six strip of blanket be wound round madame duchesne a lay on hand barrow one be across forehead so a to prevent head from dropping forward one be under arm two more round body other two be over leg basket other thing have be taken from barrow be now lifted on to one end to see if there be sign of body slipping however remained firm in upright position blanket have already be knotted by nat whose training enabled to fasten so securely that there be risk of slipping then ascended to top of step took place on little platform on bush be growing now said will raise few inch to see that be properly balanced have already seen that proposal that dinah must steady from below be not feasible although first step be immediately below bush others varied considerably being almost in same line a next to so that two third of way up hole be six foot to right of spot from have started having evidently be so constructed that from below have anyone noticed appeared to go away from bush to from last hole must be seen from below there be communication whatever ledge however although scarce noticeable from bottom of ravine be really eight inch wide from one step be necessary to gain footing on platform dinah standing below steadied barrow a high a must reach end of handle nat then leaning over managed to raise to level without doing more than scraping face of rock a rose dinah be on ledge to receive pas up to nat have soon satisfaction of seeing laid safely down in cave myra be then got up without difficulty clapped hand a entered cave be splendid nat never dreamt that there must be such safe hiding place have to be mambeelle dinah said for dey hunt runaway slabes with blood hound slabes dat escape here keep de way in de water de bit between de pool be bare rock not nice to walk on bery good for scent dat pas off in very short time den walk down here in dis water dat see below eben blood hound can not smell track in water if dey came down here might smell de step neber come here must come up other way dinah go look for sah mind be careful wrapping have now be taken off madame duchesne blanket replaced beneath be still apparently sound asleep dinah took up jug went to entrance nat followed have not given too strong dose hope dinah sah fear ob dat soon wake now will sprinkle water in face pour lillie wine down troat see wake den will be sensible dinah not at first sah 'tupid for bit abter dat depend on feber if feber strong sensible talk to herself just a if dreaming if feber not very strong know more likely not know for time got feber medicine neber fear feber come on too quick to be bery strong when feber come on slow den seem to poison ober take long time to get well when come on sudden like not like to be bery bad well must have patience dinah hope for best now will go down with fetch thing up a soon a be housed in cave nat said to myra will explore down stream see what chance there be of anyone coming up way dinah evidently think that there be fear of must like to see for fifty yard farther on there be sharp widening of ravine here tree thick undergrowth have taken root so overhung little stream that nat have difficulty in making way through remembered dinah warning advanced cautiously suddenly stopped stream fell away abruptly in front of advancing cautiously to point stood at edge of abrupt fall wall of almost perpendicular rock rose on side streamlet leaped sheer down fifty foot into pool a far a must see chasm remained unbroken splendid said to one coming up here must be likely to try bush regularly interlace over water there seems possible way of climbing up at rate within quarter of mile of place for aught know ravine may go on for mile party coming up must certainly conclude that slave must approach way must have to make tremendous detour over hill get to point where valley come down to cave be certainly grand hiding place suppose when be first discovered bush did not grow in front of likely enough be planted on purpose to hide entrance place may have be used by escaped slave ever since spaniard first landed on island began to persecute unfortunate native unless of negro who know of put mulatto up to secret may search a much a like will never find must ask dinah whether there be many who know of on returning to cave found that madame duchesne have wakened from long sleep be however quite unconscious eye be opened be muttering rapidly to herself myra be sitting beside with tear streaming down cheek must not be alarmed said dinah told must be so when woke up think that though attack of fever will be sharp one will not last very long be not a be case with new comer on island result of malaria anything of sort of agitation fatigue hab be down de stream marse glober dinah asked yes be quite right there be fear whatever of one coming to look for from direction be there many negro who know secret of place bery few said be tole only to men who be going to take to de hill who ca go farder 'cause perhaps dey be flogged till dey too weak to travel many mile man who be tole have to take great oath dat suah tell one except anober slabe running away someone who hab to go to take food to dat be how came to know jake have be tole when dey knew going to run away tole broder husband cause have be flogged so bad must not go to de mountain den husband tole 'cause must not get away wid de food tell anyone till now cause dere occasion for slabes treated too well at plantation to want to run away dere be doubt dat dere be slabes in oder plantation dat know of tink dey tell in de first place dey take big oath dey suah to die ef dey break dat in de next place because dey tell dem mulatto because day perhaps dese will be oberseers again den de secret of de cave be no longer ob use be good dinah scoundrel overheard talking other night will doubt ask if of negro know of place where must be likely to hide if one know must be able to get information be hardly likely that must ask negro of plantation now what be first thing to be done dinah de first ting sah be to gader stick to make fire right will go up ravine bring down bundle of dry stick from forest will get a dry a possible so a not to make smoke fear of anyone see smoke massa want great fire smoke scatter before get to top of de tree up above well will get at once said will pluck two of fowl while be away myra said want to be doing something when come back sah will go out gader berry to make colour for face when hab got dat done not much

bepect able to talk like going nat myra said when shawl having be converted into sash put pistol into have heard see that bayou be not killed in first attack see that can learn more must not run risk such a may be merely to ask question think that coachman toussaint must have saved want to see possibly may have made arrangement for getting down to coast might be willing to allow mother to go down with of course must have to be carried might not add much to difficulty receiving general instruction from dinah a to shortest route started without giving time for myra to remonstrate further after two hour walking approached plantation of count noe house be of course gone seeing negro girl went up to be house of toussaint asked pointed to path be de first house come to said used to live at de stable now hab de house ob one of de oberseers who be killed because did not join on reaching house indicated looked in at window saw person be looking for sitting at table reading be now man of forty eight year old tall in stature with face unusually intelligent for one of race manner be quiet simple there be certain dignity in bearing that bespoke feeling that be superior to race to belonged position occupied nat went round to door knocked toussaint opened have letter for asked quietly supposing that visitor have come with message to from one of leader of rebellion nat entered closed door behind then remember toussaint negro recognized voice doubtful accent with visitor spoke french be young english officer exclaimed though must not have known for voice heard that be at monsieur duchesne be believed that have fled to wood with wife daughter be glad that escaped have come from toussaint at least from daughter for mother have have attack of fever heard that family here have also escaped said at once that felt sure have aided did so negro said quietly be family served be duty to save moreover have always be kind to be safe saw down to coast last night risked life for although slave round here respect look upon a leader even must not have saved have suspected that have saved white people from death be not with toussaint surely negro drew up be with countryman said have always felt position greatly why must be treated a cattle because differ in colour from others did duty to employer now that be done be free to morrow will join band under francois biassou regret most deeply that people must have disgraced cause by murder of two thousand white who have fallen fully one half be woman child therefore there must have be one thousand men who if have be allowed to go free down to town must have fought against be thousand men when be million have be mistake may well ruin cause among white everywhere will confirm opinion of race that be savage brutal bloodthirsty when have opportunity in france will excite against who be before friend french troop will pour into island have revolution be peaceful one must have be approved by friend of liberty there be terrible nevertheless make more necessary that who have influence must use for good now that first fury have passed better thought may prevail may conduct war without such horror even of have great hope may be sure that white will take terrible vengeance black will retaliate will be blood for blood on side however in case like life of individual be a nothing cause be everything have myself animosity against white many of countryman have just cause for hatred against be to try to interfere to prevent from taking vengeance consider right must cause dissension so prejudice chance of success can understand then that will hold aloof altogether from interference be sorry for lady now have done duty to late employer have paramount duty to discharge to countryman decline to interfere in way then can say be nat said sternly that trust that day when be in power of enemy there will be none to give aid now deny to woman in distress so saying turned went out through door before morning broke arrived again at cave not wishing to disturb others lay down outside until sun be up then went along stream for distance bathed a returned myra be standing on ledge outside entrance welcome back called out what news have brought good news a far a friend be concerned toussaint have got down to coast sent to cape francois in boat be good news indeed cried be glad now what be bad news only bad news be that negro declined to help in same way be starting morning to join band of slave up in hill be hardly bad news said for never supposed that must help there be reason why must run risk for sake hoped that must have done so myra at same time a evidently regard success of black a certain expects to become one of leader one can understand that doe not care to run risk of compromising mamma be better morning myra said have asked after remembers what happened before fever began that be good indeed a soon a get strong enough to travel will begin to think how can best make way down to town four day later dinah on return from visit to plantation said that there have just be fighting between white coming out from cape francois slave said that ship have arrived with french troop that white men in town be coming out that be killing negro found woman child from plantation in plain be flying into wood then strike dinah that position here be very dangerous one may be sure that slave will not be able to stand against white soldier that number of will go into hiding be very likely that who know secret of place will come here yes sah bee not thought ob dat sure enough be bery likely dat ob dem may do so what tink have best be done if de slabes running into de wood de danger of passing troo must be much greater dan hab be eben if madame must walk must be bery great risk to go down great risk to 'top here too what tink know what to think dinah there be one thing be not likely that many of must come here sah dose who know about de cave must know dat not more dan eight ten must hide here use to bring lot ob people wid dem be what think dinah will keep secret to now against eight ten of be sure must hold place of when found must not get in must go back again might lead strong party here might keep watch higher up starve out even if white beat out of plantation must not know where to look for must have too much on hand to scatter over hill if be to join must be by going down dinah might go tell dem sah nat shook head be afraid dinah that passion will be so much aroused at wholesale murder of white that will shoot black come across man woman must be shot long before must get close enough to explain why have come no think only thing to be done a far a can see be that must go down from time to time to let know how thing be going think that white be likely to get very far along road may be sure that when troop started from town news be sent at once to leader be likely that will move great number of men down to oppose will likely enough drive back however great thing for be to know where be what be doing be likely now white have advanced there will no longer be watch kept to prevent people in hiding like from going down to town if find out that be so will put madame on barrow again carry down of course must have to chance being met when going through forest must risk that yes tink dat de only plan sah accordingly dinah started again next morning nat felt very anxious took up place near entrance to cave myra be busy seeing to cooking in attending upon mother about four o'clock thought heard voice crawling cautiously to mouth of cave looked out through bush eight men be coming along six of be negro other two be mulatto overseer whose conversation have overheard called softly to myra be alarmed myra be going to have fight have fear whatever of taking only one can attack at once can only come slowly there be eight of may a well bring two other pistol must not take if thought there be smallest chance of fellow getting up here go tell mother not to be frightened then do come sit down behind will hand pistol to to load there be only eight of fellow if there be eighty must hold cave even if got up to platform must only enter stooping one at time go at once to mother will be here directly how much farther be place mulatto christophe asked right dar behind dat bush negro said go up by dem step be splendid hiding place paul yes one who did not know of must have chance of finding there be someone there now see light smoke rising behind bush so there be must not be surprised if woman duchesne daughter be there be certain that someone must have helped off must have found long ago well will be rare piece of luck if be there negro have already noticed smoke be talking excitedly together have not occurred to that fugitive must have discovered place be only concerned at thought that cave might be already fully occupied hullo dar one of shouted how many ob up dar answer be returned shouted again there be still silence s'pect dar only one man said to comrade most likely gone out to look for food bery foolish leab fire burning at once proceeded to climb step followed by two others nat grasped handle of pistol determined that in first place must make sure of two mulatto be by far most dangerous of foe if escaped must have doubt keep watch higher up capture dinah on return cut off retreat from cave be time to act at once taking steady aim at paul fired with shriek mulatto fell backwards before others must recover from surprise nat fired again christophe fell forward on face in water passed pistol back to myra grasped have expected that negro must at once fly two of have turned to do so when highest climber shouted down come on ob what want run away for perhaps only one man here want to keep de cabe to soon settle with dis cabe de only safe place nat must easily have shot man determined to direct fire against below if shot climbing others must escape be of greatest importance that one must do so negro have snatched pistol from belt of fallen mulatto several shot be fired at bush nat drew back for moment a negro raised arm then discharged two barrel of pistol with a deadly effect a before seized third weapon remaining negro below dropped behind fallen rock at same moment man who be evidently leader of sprang on to ledge nat pistol be ready a negro bounded forward fired ball struck in chest fell like log over precipice in fall struck one of comrade carried down on to rock below other seemed paralysed with fear uttered shriek for mercy a nat who from position must not see sprang to foot tale that have heard from dinah of atrocity perpetrated have steeled heart to thought of mercy taking deliberate aim nat shot through head have still pistol left charged myra have not yet loaded first have handed to for be twenty second from time that first shot have be fired nat caught up sword at once made way down step ran towards rock behind last of negro have thrown a did so man leapt to foot two pistol cracked at same moment nat felt sharp pain in side own shot have missed moment later negro be rushing at with uplifted knife illustration fell like log over precipice for moment nat forgot that have shot left dropping pistol shifted sword to right hand before negro knife must fall ran through body there be now one foe left lay stunned below fallen comrade nat saw from manner in one of leg be doubled under that be broken must do harm must assuredly die if left there alone nat pressed lip together having picked up pistol put close to man head fired looking up saw myra run out with pistol in hand be all right myra thank god none of have got away be hurt asked breathlessly will come up said be hit in side think that be at serious found however a ascended step that gave acute pain time moved girl be white trembling when joined be frightened myra said be sure that be nothing serious struck rib glanced off think at worst have only broken bone go in attend to mother will not do anything of sort said come in will look at must want bandaging anyhow nat felt that be true following into cave let take off jacket wound be few inch below arm be lucky that be not little more to right said must have done for look so white myra miss be a good a mile be a thought be not just glancing wound yes girl said felt along rib yes said there be doubt that be broken can feel end grate hurt time breathe be where be just where cut begin wound be nothing what will do asked quietly tear strip two off bottom of petticoat then sew end together to make long bandage roll little piece so a to make wad about inch wide be wound bleeding yes very much fold piece four five thick lay over that other wad so a to go up down across rib now if will give little warm water piece of rag will bathe wound while be making bandage will bathe girl said be sure must hurt to get hand round in ten minute operation be completed be so sorry can not help madame duchesne murmured a myra sat down to sew strip together there be nothing that must do thank nat said cheerfully myra be getting on capitally will soon be all right again when everything be done said be trump myra have done first rate then girl who have gone on a quietly a if have be accustomed to such work life broke down bursting into fit of cry threw down by side of mother nat must have attempted to soothe mother said leave to will be better for good cry nat went down again to stream picked up four pistol creole have carried unwound sash thinking that must be better than make shift that wore a did so two small bag dropped out opened contained jewel of have seen madame duchesne wearing be bit of luck said to doubt directly entered house scoundrel made one of woman show where madame jewel case be divided content between when dinah come must get body down stream must do be not for rib must not be safe to try experiment what plucky girl myra be most girl must have be ready to faint at sight of blood will wait few minute before go up so a to give time to pull together in ten minute went up again madame said have something be sure will be very glad to get back again took off sash of rascally mulatto two bag fell out of do think contain of jewel madame duchesne myra uttered exclamation of pleasure be family jewel myra said father mother prize very much how strange must have be on men two mulatto be two of overseer doubt ran straight up seized directly entered house saw that mother wished to speak leaned down over for madame duchesne must not a yet raise voice above whisper turn out said see how many be missing although nat have seen madame duchesne in full evening dress two three time when party of friend have assembled at house have noticed beauty of jewel be surprised at number of bracelet necklace brooch ring poured out from bag of larger article supposed be ornament for hair be bent crumpled up so a to take up a little space a possible myra held up one by one before mother eye be there one of latter whispered father will be pleased greater part of myra said to nat be brought over when baron duchesne ancestor came over here first great many have be bought since have heard mamma say that successor of name estate have made point of honour to add to collection of be very proud a be certainly finest in island besides be thought that if at time hayti must be captured either by spanish people if there must be trouble with black must be great thing to have valuable must be so easily hidden carried away then have thought all along there might be rising here day yes have heard father say that when be boy have heard grandfather talk matter over with others thought that number of slave in island be so great that possibly there might day be revolt agreed that must be put down believed that negro might do terrible damage before enough troop must be brought from france to suppress thought rightly nat said though have be long time coming worst of be that even if be put down may break out again at time be hardly reasonable that when be at least ten to one against white mulatto together men must submit to be kept in slavery be very well off myra said be sure be much better off than poorer white from what have seen of think be nat replied see people know when be well off have doubt that if last white man left island slavery be abolished for ever negro must be very much worse off than be before must think must most likely go back to same idle savage sort of life that live in africa still of course at present have idea of think will be no longer obliged to work suppose somehow will be fed clothed have everything want without trouble to see be just same thing be going on in france well now what be going to do next nat will load pistol have got four more now then will take place at mouth of cave again hope that when dinah come will bring news will enable to move away fact that party be coming here for refuge show that black be growing alarmed perhaps have already suffered defeat in case way will be clear for if not must get to help clear place down below will not be difficult what have got on fire there be fowl have be stewing down to make broth for mother have cut up ready for grilling two hour later nat to surprise saw dinah hurrying down ravine for have not expected until evening stood up at once paused when caught sight of body lying below cave be all right dinah shouted have have bit of fight only lasted for minute two except got graze from pistol ball be unhurt de lord be blest sah said a came up eight ob dem kill dem sah yes one must hardly miss at distance be glad to

a soon a de white see de hurricane coming dey march back fast to de town can stand hurricane widout shelter have better light de lantern be getting a dark a night nat went to entrance looking up saw canopy of black cloud passing overhead with extraordinary rapidity almost instantaneously there came flash of lightning nearly blinding accompanied by tremendous clap of thunder turned hastily back into cave be lucky that arrived in time dinah if have be ten minute longer must have be caught stopped speaking for voice be drowned in tremendous roar be about to go to mouth of cave again dinah caught hold of jacket sah must go if show head out beyond de cabe de wind catch whirl away like leaf nobody neber see more safe comfor'ble in here just got to wait till over dat wind strong enough to trow down de strongest tree blow down de hut take de roof off de strongest house not often hab hurricane in dis island when dey come dey come bery bad dose ten tousand black fellow down at de

oder ting de roof blow off doubt de wall be low strong dey hab bad time dere dey safe with dinah assistance nat fixed blanket at point where narrow entrance widened out to keep out swirl of wind from time to time rushed in propping in place by hand barrow on madame duchesne have be brought up myra have finished cooking fowl just a nurse arrived sat down to meal heedless of terrific tempest be raging outside chapter x afloat again there will be occasion to keep watch to night dinah not in de least sah de water six foot deep one must get in a talking be out of question party lay down to sleep soon after have finished meal be time however before nat closed eye seemed to that a soon a storm be over water low enough for to pas up ravine time must be lost in attempting to make way down into town troop must doubt set out again a soon a possible battle might be fought before nightfall that negro must be beaten have doubt in case other party of fugitive might make for cave be likely that until battle be fought there must be few negro in forest who have remained there during storm must go down into full glare of sun to dry warm doubtless too francois negro leader must have sent messenger off a soon a arrived ordering able bodied men in plantation for mile round to come in to take part in battle chance of meeting with foe a descended to plain must be slight must undoubtedly be serious matter to carry madame duchesne for so long distance for have ever since leaving plantation be going farther away from town calculated that must be at least twenty five mile distant did not think that must be possible to do journey in day once down on plain might find building intact in must obtain shelter for night at last fell off to sleep when awoke din outside have ceased silence seemed almost oppressive got up pushed aside blanket looked out star be shining wind have entirely lulled bottom of ravine be still full of water felt sure that must speedily drop for depression above gorge be not extensive one water fell there must speedily find way down lit fresh candle placed in lantern a last have be renewed by dinah early in night be burning low pulled down blanket for although air be fresh cool at entrance cave be oppressively warm be two hour before day began to break by time torrent have subsided stream ran in former course be clear that in hour must be possible

house be unroofed in poor quarter many of hut be blown down upwards of twenty negro be killed do think monsieur laurent myra said moving across to that be likely to meet people on foot whom must hire hardly think so mademoiselle gentleman in town who must get away rode out with troop rest of white be patrolling street armed lest negro employed in work of port must rise during absence of troop why do ask mademoiselle because monsieur glover have rib broken by pistol day before yesterday be sure hurt very much to carry mother young man leapt from horse monsieur exclaimed pray take horse will assist in carrying madame duchesne like nat began remonstrance be unheeded insist monsieur please take rein can walk by side of horse mount whichever think will be more easy for so saying gently possessed of handle of litter placed sash over shoulder started be indeed immense relief to nat rough work of preceding day have caused end of bone to grate have set up great deal of inflammation have be suffering acutely since started in spite of support of bandage have more than once thought that must be obliged to ask myra to take place did not attempt to mount in young frenchman saddle for thought that motion of horse must be worse for than walking therefore took rein in hand walked at horse head behind litter pain be le now that be relieved of load still suffered great deal kept in rear behind others while myra chatted with monsieur laurent learning from what have happened in town giving sketch of adventure a passed house of madame duchesne sister invalid said that must be taken in there a have heard from monsieur laurent that own house be partially unroofed myra ran in to see aunt who came out with at once ah dear sister cried how have suffered have hope that have escaped

food news risked own life in doing so good bye myra hope that when see again will have got that dye off face that will be none worse for what have gone through girl lip quivered good bye nat do so hope wound will soon heal be fortunate indeed in having escaped monsieur laurent said a turned away from hear fear that very few of white except in plantation quite near town have escaped be strange that house servant who in most case have be life with master mistress who have almost always be treated a kindly a if be member of family must not have warned of what be coming must think that very few of knew nat replied be known to be attached to master mistress must hardly have be trusted by others can not think so badly of human nature a to believe that people who have be so long in close connection with master must in almost case have kept silent when knew that there be plot to massacre well will say good morning monsieur laurent said want to be back with troop be detained yesterday to great disgust to see to getting off of freight must not like to miss chance of paying of scoundrel off nat made way slowly carefully for slightest movement gave great pain to wharf one of frigate boat be ashore coxswain looked at with surprise a went down step to well be jiggered man muttered if ai mr glover then said aloud glad to see back sir ship crew be glad when heard other day that news have come a how be safe for have be afraid have be murdered by nigger be looking mighty queer sir if may say so face be stained to make look like mulatto whom be waiting for for mr normandy well how long do expect will be ca say sir be about quarter of hour since landed said must be back in hour officer be generally longer than expect well wo take above ten minute to row off to ship back will take blame if come down before have be wounded not badly be very painful want to get properly dressed right sir will get on board in time give arm must get in carefully men stretched to oar in five minute nat be alongside orpheus have heard a expected that dr bemish have gone with party have be landed assistant be on board first lieutenant be on deck saw by nat walk a went up to report return that something be matter be ill wounded mr glover be wounded sir have rib broken by pistol ball have have long journey have inflamed good deal go down at once have seen to can tell story afterwards have lady who be with got safely down also yes sir lieutenant nodded nat then went below placed in hand of assistant surgeon word glover have got wound into state latter said after have examined what on earth have be doing to seems to have be pretty clean break at first must have bothered above three week so end have evidently be sawing away into flesh why man alive what have be doing have be helping to carry sick woman down from hill nat said quietly if have be level ground must not have hurt so much on rough ground strewn with branch one must not avoid stumbling occasionally although have be bandaged before started wad slipped thing got loose after that be like walking with red hot needle sticking into so must say well will put into berth in sick bay at once fortunately have ice on board will put of on wound try to get inflammation down in short time returned with basin of ice jugful of iced lime juice nat took long drink then turned so that ice must be applied to wound must keep a still a can sha' attempt to bandage at present there be really nothing to be done till have got inflammation down will lie quiet a long a be awake can not answer for if go off to sleep will not be long for be a tired a dog to day walk must have be nothing if have be all right be pain that wore out suppose will move may be sure that rib will act like alarm give warning at once if stir in slightest having seen nat comfortable young surgeon went up on deck how do find mr glover first lieutenant asked say that be only broken rib well sir be only broken rib at first now be broken rib with acute inflammation round there be flesh wound about four inch long where bullet struck broke rib ran along went out behind must not have be anything if have kept quiet a be be a angry a must want to see wound be not worst two end of bone have be rubbing against other with enough movement to lacerate flesh with natural result that wonderful amount of inflammation have be set up round how did manage seems sir that have be carrying helping to carry sick woman down from mountain say ground be very rough strewn with bough so that one can understand that got terrible shake jolt must quite account for state of wound must think so when monsieur duchesne came off with news that wife be safely hidden glover be with said that daughter who have written note reported that mother be ill wonder have got wound in such state if have a say aided to carry down distance must have have brush with negro must have be before started sir for said that bandage shifted so wound must have be bound up before set out be gallant thing for lad to undertake most gallant action why must have be torture to must indeed sir be not in danger hope not unless fever intervenes sir doubt with rest quiet use of ice will succeed in reducing inflammation be likely enough that fever may set in if so there be saying how may go will be glad to have doctor bemish back again to take responsibility off hand late that afternoon monsieur duchesne came on board to thank nat be not allowed to see a doctor said that absolute quiet be indispensable have have full account from myra of adventure through little party have gone retailed to lieutenant doctor in ward room most gallant business altogether first lieutenant said when have finished certainly most gallant part of be undertaking to carry madame duchesne when practically disabled can understand a say directly negro be defeated by force went out against of must have made for cave be therefore absolutely necessary to get away before came however hope that need not be anxious about have gone through three four scrape of might have be fatal there be that fight with dog then be in thick of business with pirate be blown up by explosion crew killed have have marvellous escape think may feel very hopeful that will get over without serious trouble be lucky indeed finding family jewel on two of scoundrel that shot must have be great loss be such little thing in comparison to saving of wife daughter have scarcely given thought will do pleasure of calling again to morrow morning to know how be do so monsieur will probably find captain crosbie here have note from hour ago saying that be returning must be here by eight o'clock negro having be defeated safety of town being ensured for while doe not consider that must be justified in joining in pursuit of black among hill nat be not aware of return of landing party until next morning when on opening eye saw dr bemish by side young scamp latter said shaking finger at seem determined to be permanent patient a soon a recover from one injury be laid up with so here be again be only trifle time doctor umph be not so sure about macfarlane tell that not content with getting rib broken go about carrying one end of stretcher with woman on across ground where be difficult if not impossible to move without ricking hurting so that not only have set up tremendous amount of inflammation round wound have so worn end of bone that will take three time a long knitting together a must have done have be left alone be afraid be true doctor nat replied with smile see thought better to run risk of inflammation even terrible rubbing of end of bone speak of than of being caught by fiendish negro put to death by hideous torture with have in many case slowly murdered who fell into hand must have hurt badly dr bemish said a after removing dressing have late evening before be substituted for ice examined wound did hurt bit doctor a four life depended upon being able to hold on there be nothing for to set one teeth hard keep at how doe look morning what do think macfarlane can form better opinion than can a have not seen before inflammation seems to have abated good deal in case will syringe wound thoroughly with warm water there be doubtless particle of bone in until be got rid of ca hope that will heal properly will get large magnifying glass from cabin for hour wound be fomented washed a far a can see be perfectly clean now dr bemish said after carefully examining with glass will put compress on with wet cloth over must be damped with iced water half hour when quite get inflammation down glover will hope be in two three day will bandage tightly will buy pair of stay on shore lace up so that there will be chance of performing more prank with then fancy will be able to come up on deck if will promise to keep quiet there well be better than expected doctor have message to send to friend because be going ashore now to see monsieur duchesne be off yesterday afternoon macfarlane very properly refused to let see tell ca see for day doctor do so hate being made fuss over will keep away for day two anyhow doctor laughed gave ward room full history of affair so wo have trouble of going over again be comfort nat growled how long be orpheus likely to stop here doctor ah be more than can say at rate captain will not leave until get order from jamaica aeolus have just come into port captain will send off at once with despatch to admiral saying what have taken place how landed force to protect town went out with party to attack insurgent black will ask for instruction a have french vessel of war here land force be insufficient to defend place if attacked in earnest especially a there be considerable negro population who must probably rise join insurgent if made assault upon town general hope on board be that will get order to stay here at least to cruise on coast now that have broken up nest of pirate thing be likely to be dull here for time though have little doubt that ere very long will be at war with french according to last news arrived since left that national assembly of theirs be going farther farther proceeding be causing serious alarm throughout europe for be altogether subversive of existing state of thing be to measure that terrible insurrection here be due first consequence of what be really revolution in france will be loss of most valuable colony suppose have heard that something like two thousand white have be murdered have doubt now have recovered from first shock french here will take terrible vengeance though may kill great number of negro doubt if will be possible to reduce million black to submission especially in island like with mountain range running through where cannon must be absolutely useless negro must shelter in almost impenetrable forest cover large portion of chapter xi first command for couple of day one be permitted to see nat at end of time wound assumed healthy aspect be allowed to receive visit captain crosbie be first to come down be very glad to hear so good account of mr glover said cordially have done credit again lad have rendered inestimable service to monsieur duchesne family although can hardly be considered a in regular course of duty will certainly forward narrative of adventure to admiral next time go to port royal have better go in for examination if pas have very little doubt that acting rank will be given to at once aiding to carry down lady when wounded be really very fine action for doctor bemish tell that must have suffered intensely monsieur duchesne be most anxious to see doctor have told that will be better for to wait until be well enough to go ashore when can go see together thank sir must much rather do really person to be thanked be old negress who gave warning in time to escape went down fetched food despatched message to monsieur duchesne got answer back who did a much a did in carrying mistress down doubtless behaved very well mr glover doe not alter fact that did so also a even will admit have hand in fight in killed eight of scoundrel be not much of fight sir have advantage in position that really did not like shooting in spite of what have heard of doings be life theirs knew that if one of got away must bring down score of others must speedily have starved out at present time captain said sternly mercy to villain must be misapplied lesson must be terrible one there will speedily be end to white rule in island thing be be revolution to succeed might expect similar outbreak in own island now will leave comrade will come in to see visit must for present be short nat progressed rapidly in three day water dressing be given up be tightly bandaged over rather to disgust doctor insisted upon wearing pair of stay be very well glover doctor bemish said in answer to remonstrance know what be be a active a cat must be constantly forgetting springing to do something thing laced tightly on will act a reminder will also bind so closely together that while will have free use of limb rib will be held a if in vice will have to keep on until bone have fairly knit have reason to be thankful that be only inconvenience have to suffer from expedition might have cost life four day later doctor bemish said think can go ashore to day of course must be careful especially getting in out of boat if do walk slowly think will do harm madame duchesne be up going on nicely be most anxiously expecting indeed duchesne said yesterday that if did not let go on shore to day must come on board to see feel like hog in armour in stay doctor never mind that lad must be almost a bad if took off for must have to put on twice a many bandage to pull ever so much tighter have told captain that be letting go ashore have also told mr philpot so be settled will be going off in hour will take with keep eye over until get to gate one must think be small boy going to be taken to school nat laughed stopping however abruptly there see doctor said that gave twinge know must be careful lad must indeed there be objection to smiling a much a like there be nothing shake one up more than hearty laugh be why at other time laughing be healthy exercise with rib in process of healing be better not to indulge in well will be ready when be nat accomplished journey without pain wo come in doctor asked when arrived at gate glover will be sort of family party have warned duchesne not to throw on neck have told that be to be looked at not touched with uneasy smile nat left at gate walked up drive be evidently on watch for for door opened almost immediately monsieur duchesne ran down mon cher exclaimed doctor have said that must not touch can scarce refrain from embracing how can thank for that have done monsieur have done next to nothing shot negro who have not chance of getting at helped dinah to carry madame down owe safety to dinah who be splendid in devotion making journey backwards forward to say nothing of giving warning enabled to escape in time dinah be splendid monsieur duchesne admitted can hing for have told that will have house plenty to live on day will not leave have made out paper of freedom say 'what use be have be servant life must be different whether be what call free woman not ' what pleased most be have given freedom to grandson who brought message down here be going to employ in stable that have received new black silk gown have got on in honour of visit if have be royal robe must not be more proud of have by time arrived at door monsieur duchesne led nat to drawing room where wife be lying on sofa myra standing beside yellow dye have now nearly worn off face madame duchesne be still pale looked bright happy nat went up to took hand be truly glad to see up again said have ended well replied with tear in eye seems like bad dream to especially that journey how good kind be know now how terribly must have suffered hurt bit at time madame one get accustomed to being hurt went on so well that be not worth grumbling about ah look more now myra held out hand to embrace dear for for twice have saved life have be more than brother to myra threw arm round nat neck kissed heartily twice while eye be full of tear have not hurt hope said a drew back not bit must not have minded if have nat said then sat down talked quietly for time be going out to morrow again monsieur duchesne said be duty of white to join in punishing ungrateful fiend hear that have be beaten badly near port au prince of negro be find remaining quietly on plantation unless have murdered master will be spared quarter will be given to taken in arm at rate will clear of out of plain near bay drive into mountain where can not hope to subdue till large number of troop arrive from home so vigorously indeed did white pursue negro that in fortnight after outbreak be calculated that fewer than ten thousand black have fallen many of being put to death by method almost a cruel ferocious a have adopted be still in such vast number that be evident that must be impossible to overpower until troop arrived from france indeed farther french column penetrated into mountain more severe be resistance met with on several occasion white be repulsed with heavy loss truce be therefore agreed upon being arranged that party must attack other until expiration there being therefore occasion for orpheus to remain longer at cape francois sailed for jamaica nat wound continued to go on well be still stiff felt advantage of encircling stay so much that no longer objected to wear a be likely that until matter be finally settled orpheus must be constantly cruising on coast of hayti that must ere long see french friend again parting be not sad one indeed nat be by mean sorry to get under way again to escape expression of gratitude of monsieur duchesne wife two day after arriving at port royal nat received notice that court composed of three captain of vessel then in port must on following day sit to examine midshipman who have served time be within year of completing at once sent in name a have read hard during time have be unfit for service have fear of not passing ordeal at conclusion of examination be told by president of court that have passed with great credit on returning to frigate found note from admiral requesting to call upon on return from court at once proceeded to flag ship have heard great deal of mr glover admiral said when be ushered into cabin first of heard story from captain of gallant manner in at risk of own saved young lady life at cape francois when attacked by savage hound be seriously injured thereby then received captain crosbie official report of share took in attack upon formidable nest of pirate report being supplemented by subsequent relation to of whole fact of affair conduct there also did very great credit have passed must at once have given acting rank now have again distinguished though scarcely in manner come under official knowledge must be glad to hear from detailed account of affair when nat have finished narration said have scarcely done justice to yourself captain dr bemish be dining with last night latter said wounded a be work of carrying that french lady down to coast must have be intensely painful one a be shown by state of wound when examined in matter have shown courage conduct a hear that have now passed will take first opportunity of giving acting rank speak french fluently speak quite fluently sir a have only picked up by ear can not say that speak well however fact that speak well enough to converse freely may be useful hayti be likely to be in very disturbed state for time there can be little doubt that negro in other island be watching what take place there with close attention that there be possibility of revolt spreading at present there be saying what course of event may be already governor here have received letter from several french resident expressing desire that must take island a believe that french revolutionary government will make serious effort to put down rising of course at present a be at peace with france nothing can be done at same time be important that must obtain accurate information a to what be going on there what be feeling of negro of mulatto population will probably have several small vessel cruising in water falcon under command of lieutenant low who also belonged to orpheus have be for week on southern coast of island intend to have three four other craft at same work soon on first opportunity will appoint to one of nat expressed warm thanks retired three four day later received intimation that prize arrow schooner of hundred fifty ton must at once be put into commission that admiral have selected for command be far more than nat have even hoped for from manner in admiral have spoken thought that must be appointed to craft of description have expectation whatever of being given command with intimation be order for to again call upon admiral be small command admiral said when nat expressed thanks for appointment can not spare more than twenty five hand quarter master two midshipman will have mr turnbull of leander a first officer mr lippincott of pallas have carried six gun hitherto will only take four however will be twelve pounder before have only nine naturally be not intended that will do fighting of course if be attacked will defend be hardly match for of piratical craft except quite smaller class native boat manned by band of desperado mission will be to cruise on coast of hayti to take off white fugitive must show to communicate if possible with negro find out object propose to report on force organization method of fighting in great care will be necessary for have shown so faithless treacherous that be impossible to place confidence in promise of safe conduct in such matter be impossible to give advice a to conduct must be guided by circumstance be prudent careful at same time enterprising schooner be very fast one have be slaver have more than once shown heel to of fastest cruiser therefore if come across piratical craft too big to fight will at least have fair chance of outsailing greatly delighted nat returned to orpheus so be going to leave mr glover captain said when came on board congratulate at same time will be very sorry to lose hope that when there be vacancy will have back again fully deserve promotion have be credit to ship next day nat moved effect ashore there be little leave taking between comrade for be certain that must often meet at port royal spent time for next fortnight in dockyard seeing to refitting of schooner superintendent there have heard of affair with dog of manner in have saved life of french lady daughter dr bemish being old friend of be therefore much more complaisant than dockyard official generally be to demand made upon by young lieutenant in command of small craft indeed when schooner be ready for sea nat have reason to be proud of have be provided with complete suit of new canvas woodwork have be scraped varnished running rigging be new standing rigging have also be renewed wherever showed sign of wear ballast have before be almost entirely of iron ore be now of pig iron in view of extra stability so given have have new topmast ten foot higher than have before carried must advise to keep weather eye lifting mr glover captain crosbie said when nat paid farewell visit to frigate that craft of yours look very much over sparred if be caught in squall with topsail up chance be must turn turtle will be very careful sir nat said although now have iron ballast think that even with slight addition in height of spar will be a stiff a be before in moderate breeze while will certainly be faster in light wind be so captain agreed of course be in light wind speed be of most importance there can be doubt that in hand of careful commander large spread of canvas be great advantage while in hand of rash one craft can hardly be too much under sparred turnbull nat first officer be quiet young fellow few month junior to nat be square in build with resolute good humoured face nat have doubt that admiral have selected a being likely to pull better with than more lively vivacious young fellow must be from first day met on board be sure that turnbull must get on extremely well together latter carried out suggestion order a punctually a must have done of post captain going about work in a steady business like way a if have be accustomed for year to perform duty of first officer one evening nat have asked lippincott to dine with at hotel ordered private room think said when meal be over waiter have placed dessert wine on table have retired that be going to have very pleasant cruise be afraid sha' have much chance of distinguishing in fighting way though may pick up of rascally little craft prey on native commerce capture small european merchantman occasionally with small crew certainly can not regard a match for of regular pirate who must carry vastly heavier metal crew of at least four time strength admiral expressly warned that be not intended that arrow must undertake sort of business mission be rather to gain news of what pass in interior pick up fugitive who may be hiding in wood act in fact a sort of floating observatory fighting therefore that may get will be if be attacked in case of course will do best be sure will be pleasant party on board of course in small craft like will mess together be necessary for sake of discipline that when be on deck must follow usual observance when be below together will be three mess mate without formality nonsense two junior remained on ship until schooner be out of hand of dockyard men according to custom nat did not join until crew have gone on board spent day in scrubbing deck making everything tidy ship shape then gig went ashore to fetch off a rowed alongside must not help smiling at seeing sentry at gangway two young officer standing there to receive however with effort recovered gravity mounted short accommodation ladder saluted flag returned salute of officer men on board frigate have be inconsiderable member of crowd now be monarch of surveyed then crew be formed up according to custom read commission appointing to command article of war now men said when have brought meeting to end have according to rule read article of war very necessary step when taking command of vessel of war with hand collected from part many of coming on board one of majesty ship for first time be mere formality to crew composed of men like yourselves who will be perfectly sure do duty in storm calm who will must there be occasion for fighting show small a number be be capable of taking own part against considerably larger force officer will do in power to make ship comfortable pleasant one rely upon to show zeal heartiness in service men replied with hearty cheer most of belonged to orpheus have already told others of captain doings in hayti in attack on pirate island said how popular be on board think be going to have good time one of others said a went forward ai likely to capture anything very big in cockle shell look upon a sort of pleasure ship will see if get chance will take one of men from orpheus said be with in fight against pirate tell have never be in anything hotter be one of who volunteered to go with to drown magazine of brigantine next to tell never felt so scared in life be just a cool a cucumber though have be knocked silly by explosion quarter of hour before be right sort be though expect have got order not to tackle anything too big for be not sort of chap to run away if can find smallest excuse for fighting in meantime nat have gone below with two midshipman accommodation for officer be excellent there be large cabin aft have be handsomely fitted up by late captain off on one side be state room on other for two officer beyond be steward cabin pantry on one side spare cabin have be given to quarter master on other nat have engaged negro a cook son lad of seventeen eighteen a cabin steward have sent on board small stock of wine ordered boy to open bottle to put glass on table drank together to success of cruise have just finished when quarter master came down admiral be signalling for to send boat to sir lower gig at once officer followed quarter master on deck mr lippincott have better go with in hour midshipman returned with despatch nat broke seal have evidently be dictated by admiral to clerk signature being at foot news have just arrived that french assembly have cancelled act placing mulatto on same footing a white former have in consequence risen have joined black situation must be most precarious for white in island get up sail at once make for cape francois cruise between port south eastern limit of hayti do what can to aid fugitive be to be off at once said to mr turnbull please get up anchor make sail there be fresh trouble in mulatto have joined black quarter master whistle sounded crew sprang into activity capstan be manned men ran to loosen sail in ten minute falcon be on way matter be bad enough before nat said when having seen that sail be set everything in good order two officer came aft few mulatto overseer class rose with negro great bulk of having got what wanted joined white stood neutral now that have thrown in lot with black prospect seems almost desperate however turn out there be doubt that island be ruined white who be lucky enough to escape with life will find instead of being rich men be penniless be horrible business altogether will be glad when get to cape francois can get news of what be really going on nat be delighted at speed shown by schooner breeze be light felt full advantage of added spread of canvas be very beamy craft of light draught scarcely showed perceptible heel under pressure of wind fully justifying opinion a to improvement to be effected by substitution of iron ballast for have before carried turnbull lippincott be le pleased whole crew felt proud of little craft can go sir mistake turnbull said a stood aft looking upwards at sail down into water glancing past side must take fast craft indeed to overhaul sail be splendidly cut yes tipped man who be at head of sail making gang five pound note to take special pain with money must have be well laid out if have be fifty time a much for will make difference of point at least when be close hauled mean getting away from fellow too big for instead of being overhauled by yes turnbull said with smile might enable to keep out of reach of bow gun while hammered with stern chaser yes might have effect nat replied with answering smile what be going through water now quarter master good seven knot sir be fast enough orpheus must not be making more than six in such light breeze a towards sunset wind fell until scarcely seemed that there be breath on water schooner still crept along at two half knot hour although sail scarcely lifted crew have already be divided in watch turnbull took starboard lippincott larboard watch hardly know nat laughed a sat together in cabin after dinner except when be on sick list be first experience of not having night watch to keep however expect will be up down at rate call if there be slightest change in weather know what can do in light wind now wo risk anything until have seen how carry sail in sharp blow somewhat restless under extent of responsibility nat be on deck several time during night there be however sign of change arrow be still stealing through water with wind abeam two midshipman equally impressed with responsibility of being in command of watch be on alert look out be vigilant wind freshened again when sun rose at noon there be white head on water schooner heeling over bit now be doing nearly nine knot three officer took observation to satisfaction found that be within mile of other at present moment however there be doubt a to situation for high land near cape dame marie lay clearly in sight over bowsprit while behind hill over morant point lay like dim haze if have have wind whole way nat said regretfully must have be well in bay by time still must not grumble have made hundred knot mid day gun fired just a got under way considering that for twelve hour have wind worth speaking of think have done very well indeed if wind will hold like will be near port by noon to morrow ca reckon on be sure to fall before sunset besides wind be generally baffling shifty when once get into bay by three o'clock wind have already begun to fall by five be lying almost becalmed off westerly point of island for next two day wind be very light be late in afternoon of second when dropped anchor off cape francois nat at once went ashore a usual received warm welcome from duchesnes madame have now quite recovered from effect of adventure a also have myra did not know that orpheus be in port else must have be expecting be not in port madame arrived in majesty schooner arrow have honour to command then be captain glover now must be very respectful myra made deep curtsy will be good many year before will have right to be addressed by title have passed examination a lieutenant have now acting rank will doubt be confirmed by authority at home may be addressed a lieutenant without breach of etiquette still of course be grand thing to get command so much greater chance of distinguishing however a be small craft carry only twenty five men be not in position to do great thing in way of fighting though of course may overhaul capture of native craft be nominally trader be ready to capture small vessel may come across mission really be to obtain news of what be passing in island have received word at kingston that mulatto have risen joined black have be sent off at once to learn real state of thing unhappily news be true monsieur duchesne said there have already be several fight in of have got best of in others have be driven back to town be impossible for look out to be darker than be seems to that only hope be england will consent to take over sovereignty of island send force large enough to put down insurrection of planter here have already lost heart have sailed for jamaica bermuda other british port have intention of following example at present be a know merchant a well a planter although of course trade be at end now must spring up again in time fortunately feel confident that town can resist assault french man of war came in after sailed landed dozen of gun have erected four battery there be too good many old gun in town have also be put into position a have french regiment here fully five hundred white who can be relied on have small fear of being overpowered be glad to say that before man of war left great majority of negro be expelled from town quarter burnt down so that have fear of being attacked from within a well a from without be really greatest danger have be hanging over night day ever since beginning of rising be mulatto negro acting together in case a rule keep apart there be love lost between only bond of union be hatred of black curiously enough have declared against republic call royalist army consider very naturally that republic while giving right to mulatto have done nothing for therefore a republic have declared against king have declared for do think that english government will accept offer to transfer to british rule see that must do so sir at present be nominally at peace with france although everyone see that war must come before long until be declared must scarcely take over french possession do think there be anything like troop enough in island to undertake such serious operation a must be people must not give much help negro though calling royalist be fighting only for liberty must gain nothing by mere change of master knowing a do that slave be certainly no better treated in island than in of france be what thought monsieur duchesne said certainly nothing short of army of thirty thousand strong must hope for success doubt indeed whether in so large mountainous island even that number must do much of course fully of be spanish complicates matter great deal may be sure that if negro of end be successful under spaniard will very soon follow example if worst come to worst will of course leave island whether must settle in one of island make england residence can not say of countryman have gone to america must put out of mind think must prefer england to remaining out here for there might be similar rising in jamaica elsewhere a to france be out of question france have gone mad know that many of good family have sought refuge in england must at least find society congenial to happily be in condition to choose for ancestor have be wise men have long foreseen that what have actually occurred might possibly take place in succession have impressed view upon son have become almost family tradition among one upon have often be rallied for with few exception here seem to have regarded state of thing a being a unchangeable a scripture say be law of medes persian if have be only tradition have not be acted upon must not have benefited now for six generation of ancestor have regarded a sacred duty to set aside nearly tenth of revenue a provision when trouble must come money have be chiefly invested in england holland interest on accumulation of year have be reinvested believe that although regard such investment a be made in france a lost will when reckon up matter find that income will be fully a large a have drawn from property trade here be very glad to hear duchesne have indeed while have be away thought very often of what must happen to family if be forced to finally abandon estate leave island have reason to be grateful indeed nat to forethought of who have gone before be strange that same idea did not occur to others one can see now that people here have be living in fool paradise totally oblivious of fact that volcano might at moment open under foot be going to remain here oh be only making starting place order be to cruise along southern coast to render assistance can to refugee if possible to open communication with of chief of insurgent endeavour to find out what plan be must be decided to accept cession of island when war with france break out what attitude of black mulatto must be will not be likely to pick up refugee for white be exterminated except in town must of smaller place be attacked might render good service by receiving at least woman child on board that evening monsieur duchesne asked brother in law doctor several other leading inhabitant to house in order that nat might gather view found that in main agreed with of host except that be hopeful that france must a soon a news arrived despatch army of sufficient force to put down insurrection after last of guest have departed monsieur duchesne shook head france will ere long require soldier to defend own frontier saturnalia of blood in be indulging will cause to be regarded a common enemy of europe hear that already emigrant noble be pressing various european court to march army into france to free king royal family from imprisonment by mob of paris ere long there will assuredly be coalition france will need strength to resist england be certain to join even have france troop to spare must find difficulty in sending here so will not change mind stay with for night be already nearly eleven ordered gig to be alongside at hour certainly must not like to sleep out of ship though have doubt that two young officer must see that everything went on right on reaching schooner nat found that turnbull lippincott be still up be such lovely night that have be smoking on deck until few minute ago be of course anxious to hear news at nat order steward brought hot water glass three tumbler of grog be filled sat for couple of hour discussing strange situation in island chapter xii rescue arrow be one morning lying at anchor in small bay on south coast when one of sailor called nat attention to boy who have run down be wildly waving arm nat caught up telescope may be white boy said lower gig will go in quick may be pursued took very short time to cross quarter of mile of water lad rushed in up to chin to meet be quickly hauled into boat hand face have be blackened have so worn off that merely presented appearance of sooty faced white boy burst into fit of convulsive sobbing a found among friend nat saw that be useless to question at moment so told men to row back at once to schooner then half carried down to own cabin brought out glass of wine gave to drink that up lad said then can tell something about boy put glass with shaking hand to lip drank down be right lad now tell something about what be name be girl monsieur name be louise pickard have be hiding in forest for six week father mother sister ten frenchman who worked for lived on fruit what provision men must obtain by going down to plantation at night two day ago negro found killed one of men at once rest of took sister be dressed a boy be going to kill one by one burnt one of men to death yesterday tied to tree round made look on morning killed cut off arm at elbow leg at knee then cut about with knife till died then shut up together again there be little window father pushed through have heard negro say that there be vessel in bay with white men in hole be in back of house there be tree there so that managed to get off without being seen by negro father tried to get valerie through same window be too big be two year older than be must not have squeezed through have not father pushed told to come down to shore take refuge with how many of black scoundrel be there nat asked illustration rescue of louise pickard two three hundred negro be going to attack to night there be fisherman boat at village mile two along shore father told to warn did not like coming away must have liked to have died with others be so awful to look on at torture if must have killed at once must not have minded oh monsieur be too terrible can not do something for again burst into tear will see what can be done said putting hand kindly on shoulder be going up on deck now be cabin opened door of berth steward will bring hot water then have better have wash get rid of charcoal for suppose be charcoal on face can hing for in way of dress at present if will take off thing put outside door will get washed at once can lie down in berth until be dry wo take very long in hot climate steward by order brought in can of hot water girl retired with to cabin nat went on deck told turnbull lippincott what have heard from be awful latter said can hing sir be point mr lippincott feel that be impossible for to remain quiet while such devilry be being carried on among wood see matter be rendered more difficult by fact that be going to be attacked to night crew be weak enough already if three four boat full of black be to fall upon must not spare man while if be to land must need man for job even then must be terribly weak something have to be done be evident have to hit upon plan now let set wit to work at moment black steward came up from cabin with bundle boy be put dese thing outside door sah wat be to do wid dem bring along to galley sam must get father to wash pomp went on to cook have got plenty of hot water yes sah allus hab hot water well look here want sam to set to work wash clothes at once boy brought on board turn out to be french girl daughter of planter who be in hand of negro up there must see to morrow what can do in way of rigging out properly for to day must manage with thing get a white a can then hang up to dry want on deck again a soon a possible to give information a to where friend be confined right sah soon get dese clean may a well heat up basin of turtle soup have yesterday expect have have little enough to eat of late then went back to quarter deck seems to sir turnbull said that if girl must go ashore with a guide might succeed after get dark put one of hand on shore with saw bottle of oil to make work noiselessly then must crawl up to little window by got out cut away wood for doubt be wooden hut till hole be large enough for of to get out seems good plan turnbull certainly only drawback be that probably before get dark negro will have discovered that boy a consider have escaped will keep sharp look out on others then too although one two might get out noiselessly make escape chance of ten people doing so must be much smaller if attempt be detected might only share fate if have crew close at hand to cover retreat might be managed great a must be odds against see there be boat attack to be guarded against think must allow to run risk turnbull still something must be done sir yes be agreed a to nat said going to rail stood there gazing at shore for minute have idea said suddenly turning round see that point near mouth of bay where rock rise eight ten foot straight out from water edge there be tree behind will be dark night if must get schooner over there without noticing a think must must probably lay pretty close alongside when boat came betting be that must never find must row about for bit looking for where be anchored not finding must come to conclusion that have got up sail gone away after dark in way must land whole party think must do first rate sir of course there be certain amount of risk of discovering nat went on must chance that will send topmast down a soon a be dark so that wo show against sky line boat might then row within twenty yard of without noticing especially if can get in pretty close be just possible that may be able to lay right against rock water be deep pretty close in even opposite to for girl be not more than four five yard from shore when be up to neck in water doubt be good deal deeper than at foot of rock a soon a be dark mr lippincott have better take boat sound along there of course will muffle oar must be great thing if must get alongside in first place nearer get in le likely that must be to be seen in next place must be very important if be hotly pursued to be able to get on board without having to use boat certainly turnbull agreed when have got in place nat went on will take light anchor out fifty fathom so put hawser round windlass so that instant be on board four men told off beforehand can run forward set to work once be three yard out must be safe from boarding however strong force may be will have gun on side loaded with double charge of grape before land once out will give dose will remember for long time now may a well tell crew will be delighted at prospect of fight men be clustered together forward discussing whether anything be likely to take place for arrival of boy fact that have be taken down to cabin aft have not reappeared evident anxiety of officer sufficed to show that something unusual be on hand when came aft nat said men be about to undertake enterprise will be sure be after own heart apparent boy brought on board be young french lady parent sister seven white men be in hand of negro who day murder one with horrible torture now be going to rescue cheer broke from men job will be pretty tough one men wo like worse for there be hear two three hundred of murderous brute up there of course if can get prisoner out without fight will do so hardly think will be able to manage that matter be somewhat complicated by fact that hear that boat attack be going to be made upon to night now be certainly not strong enough to carry off party at same time to leave enough men on board to defend schooner after be dark therefore intend to take across to rock over there moor a close to a can strike topmast in way may hope that on moonless night a will be boat will not find will suppose that have sailed away however of that must run risk will take man with of course will batten hatch down fasten so that if do find will give a much trouble a possible may possibly catch at work a return will of course take musket brace of pistol cutlass have doubt that be being watched from shore therefore go about work a usual gather together talking give cause to suppose that be intending to do anything be not likely that escape of girl have yet be discovered for if be watching among tree up there must hardly have noticed that boat took extra person from shore grease fall of gig so that can be lowered noiselessly muffle oar a soon a be quite dark mr lippincott will take sounding in order to see how close into rock will be safe to take with low hearty cheer expressing satisfaction felt at prospect of fight with negro crew went forward again one of set to work to grease fall not only of gig of other boat in case must also be required two others cut up old guernsey lashed round gig oar at point where must touch thole pin others resumed occupation of polishing brass work while rest sat down under shelter of bulwark talked over adventure on be about to engage in hour girl clothes be washed dried one of crew who have served a assistant sail maker have at once under nat instruction set to work to sew dozen flag together with have constructed garment if primitive in design be at least somewhat feminine in appearance round top be deep hem through be run thin cord by aid of must be drawn together gathered in at neck six inch from top two of seam between flag be left open be for arm hole primitive pinafore be to be drawn in at waist by belt man have chosen from among signal flag whose colour went best together though result be extremely motley be yet very fair substitute for dress three officer must not help laughing a brought aft to show be very well contrived jenkins nat said have doubt young lady will greatly prefer to going about dressed a boy a clothes be by time dry nat told sam to take below with new garment to lay down outside state room door then to knock tell young lady that be there in readiness for that a soon a be dressed lunch must be ready when have done be to come up on deck again quarter of hour later nat went down clothes have disappeared girl who be about thirteen year of age came out have with exception of coat donned former garment over have put flag pinafore arm be covered by of light flannel shirt dress hung straight down round be queer looking thing said with smile be best can manage in emergency here be belt if strap that round waist will make thing look more comfortable girl smiled wanly now that face hand be clean nat saw that be pretty little thing must have be prettier have not hair be cut quite short be going evening nat went on to try to rescue parent sister from black fiend clasped hand before oh sir be good of not at suppose that be going to remain here quietly knowing that close by there be white people in hand of scoundrel will want to act a guide be going to take saw with cut away wood round that hole escaped by hope to get friend out without negro seeing if do so much worse for now will sit down while steward lay cloth for lunch will be ready in two three minute then will bring other two officer down to introduce to raised voice sam luncheon a soon a possible young negro be expecting order ran in at once with table cloth plate basket in two three minute table be laid then went out returned with plate eberyting ready sah bring down de soup when gib de word give compliment to mr turnbull mr lippincott ask to come down to lunch girl looked anxious shy a heard footstep coming down companion expression of relief came over face a saw that be even younger than officer have already seen be officer mademoiselle mr turnbull mr lippincott french be not of best must make allowance for girl smiled held out hand to two middy news that parent sister might yet be rescued have already greatly raised spirit do look funny do not said be sure look very nice turnbull replied be quite novelty for to have lady on board be going to help bring friend down yes be going will get down hope will have chance of punishing of murderous nigger mean hope that there will be fight asked in tone of surprise a took seat on nat right hand do turnbull said heartily there be not man on board who must not be sorry if be to get down again without opportunity of having slap at beggar mr turnbull be very bloodthirsty character nat said gravely know whether have in french history of jack giant killer never saw such book said looking little puzzled did really kill giant yes jack did be wonderful that way mr turnbull have never be able to find giant mean to take out of black be sorry to say mademoiselle turnbull said that although when on quarter deck captain word may be received a gospel permit very wide latitude of speech in own cabin fact be that disposition may be have never yet have opportunity for performing very desperate action whereas lieutenant glover have be killing enemy by score fighting with wild beast attacking pirate in hold have be blown up into air rescued lady from slaughter by negro french girl turned eye wonderingly towards nat need not believe more than like mademoiselle said with laugh be afraid that be given to exaggerate very much mr turnbull be champion fabricator be quite true that be going to try to get father mother sister away from negro be quite true nat said earnestly be certainly going to try to get think that have good chance of doing so much will depend of course upon whether can reach hut where be confined before being discovered see have only twenty five men counting including quarter master steward cook thirty one be small force though might bring prisoner off in safety if once got into hand must be serious thing if negro have time to rally round hut before got there how doe stand be surrounded by tree be at edge of forest there be large indigo field in front be there most of negro be there may be in forest did not see a came down here that be good how many do say there be seven men without counting father will tell eight of sailor to carry up boarding pike turnbull unfortunately have spare firearm however boarding pike be not bad weapon a doubt only small portion of negro have gun will add good deal to strength if come to hand to hand fight that will turnbull agreed that will bring up to thirty nine thirty nine white ought to be able to fight way easily enough through black mob especially a will take by surprise wo know how many of there be a soon a became dark lippincott went off in gig returned in hour with news that there be six foot of water at foot of rock twelve foot ten yard away think sir said that must get in within three four yard of rock must do excellently nat said carpenter have better set to work at once nail three plank have got down below fifteen foot long side by side let two of hand help tell if doe not think that will be stiff enough to nail one of spare oar on plank have learned from girl that many of negro sat up by fire nearly night that therefore there be advantage in delaying landing be anxious to move schooner a soon a possible a boat might appear at time everything be in readiness arm have be brought on deck musket pistol loaded a soon a gangway be knocked together did not take many minute lippincott went off in gig with long hawser a soon a returned reported that have fastened to tree above rock crew tailed on schooner be noiselessly towed to place hawser be taken on shore be hauled broadside on until lay with only few inch of water under keel within ten foot of line of rock hatchway have be securely fastened down old chain be taken round trunk of large tree end shackled round mainmast must be loosed almost instantaneously by crew when returned must much increase difficulty that negro must encounter in getting vessel away if discovered edge of rock be three foot higher than rail there be therefore difficulty in ascending gangway when have crossed be pulled up pushed in among bush followed shore till reached spot at girl have come down a must more easily find way from there than from place where have landed telling others to follow in single file nat took place with girl at head how far be said to in low tone be just at top of hill will be there in le than quarter of hour sailor have be warned to walk with greatest caution especially to avoid striking of weapon against tree went slowly for be very dark in forest beyond fact that have come straight down hill when escaped must give information about way did not look said ran straight down be sure that if go a straight a can up from water will come upon plantation then will be able to tell exactly where hut be keeping therefore upward went on until reached level ground saw by faint light ahead that be nearing edge of forest stepped even more cautiously then until arrived at open ground dozen great fire blazed in various place in front of must hear laughing talking of negro be more to right girl said be nearly in corner of field where see that fire be close to hut always keep big fire there leader sleep round there be always two negro on guard in front of hut expect have got one behind now of course have found out by time that have escaped must have known that must only have be by window keeping well inside line of tree crept along to corner of clearing two negro have be instructed in part be to play a soon a got well round behind house others halted knife in hand crept through tree then upon hand knee crawled forward others listened intently gabble of voice continued on other side of hut when louder yell of laughter than usual broke out saw figure appear at one corner look round a if anxious to hear what be going on suddenly two arm appeared from darkness behind be grasped by throat disappeared suddenly from sight two minute later sam came through tree dat chile gib de alarm sah can go on now cut window carpenter man told off to assist at once ran forward accompanied by girl nat who went straight to little window have told that must not speak for mother sister might utter sudden exclamation must alarm sentry on other side putting face to window said in low voice pray be silent slightest sound might cost life be here to rescue daughter be safe sound with now be going to enlarge window low exclamation of delight told that be heard carpenter at once set to work man with oiling saw very frequently nevertheless seemed to nat to make even more noise than usual suddenly however one of prisoner began to utter prayer in loud voice be girl whispered used to say prayer night be very good idea to begin now nat said what with row by fire voice inside guard be not likely to hear saw in ten minute window have be enlarged to point sufficient for full sized person to get through now madam will come first nat said will pull through right one by one captive be got out there be still two men left when door opened three four negro appeared with blazing brand have come to fetch one of out to give lillie fun bake ober de fire then broke off with shout of astonishment a saw that hut be almost untenanted others be about to rush forward at two men still there when nat thrust arm through opening two shot cracked out one after other two leading negro fell others with yell of terror rushed out of hut quick for life said to two men one of whom be already half through window will have on in few minute in few second men be out nat two seaman ran with to edge of wood to other captive have be passed on a soon a be freed by time air be ringing with yell shout now men move along little farther so a to get view of fire then will give volley negro be rushing forward yelling shouting when twenty five musket rang out with deadly aim for black be not more than thirty yard away load again lad will sicken for bit shouted indeed negro with yell of astonishment fear have run back leaving fourteen fifteen of number on ground be loaded ay ay sir then down hill go have three lady gone on yes sir two black went down with have frenchman got pike be good now keep a close a can together be coming up by score will make rush in minute so a fast a must sailor rescued men made way down hill owing to thickness of tree be impossible to run have gone short distance when there be outburst of yell round looking back nat saw number of blazing brand have better have kept in dark muttered must not have come so fast more of must go back alive hurry men said take coolly take care of tree be sure to come up to for can see way wo be in such hurry when open fire again be half way down hill when gave order four men next to turn round pick off of fellow with torch rest halt in case make rush four shot be fired one after other a many negro fell be ready lad four more fire shot have equal success many of negro at once took refuge behind tree will do men on go again make more noise than can help with yelling wo be sure that have moved illustration four shot be fired a many negro fell be not indeed until be down on shore that negro again came up with then burst out at several point from tree being uncertain of exact course retreating party have taken now keep together in body men nat shouted in english repeated same order in french march steadily forward have got to fight way through now that negro saw how comparatively small be number of foe rushed upon throw away shot nat shouted now let have men who have already fired have loaded again a negro came up crackling fire broke out from little party now lad at with pistol cutlas pike must get through fellow ahead before others come up with loud cheer sailor rushed upon black cutting thrusting men who have be released fighting with desperate fury with pike mad with thirst for revenge for horrible atrocity that witnessed thought of fate have escaped pistol cracked out continually be not long before negro lost heart sailor at nat order flung upon cut way through straight on now men show that can run a well a fight will have hundred more of down on directly there be doubt of yell rose from forest light of many brand showed that whole of negro be hastening to join comrade nat have previously begged two officer quarter master not to use pistol with ran in rear line few only of negro pressed closely behind rest dismayed by slaughter have taken place awaited arrival of comrade now turn let have barrel nat said four men facing round levelled pistol six of leading negro fell while others halted at once keep other pistol nat said will want at gangway there be shout of satisfaction a men in advance caught sight of schooner two negro have already placed gangway in position have crossed with three lady monsieur pickard who have accompanied over go men nat shouted be close behind most of men be across when crowd of black came rushing along sam pomp have taken station at taffrail a head of mob came on musket flashed out two leading men fell then opened fire with pistol at same moment nat three companion discharged remaining pistol then ran down gangway sailor having by time passed over plank be at once pulled on board now unshackle chain round with capstan nat shouted rest of lie down behind bulwark moment later chain be unshackled a capstan rapidly revolved schooner head receded from shore yell of rage broke from negro scattered fire of musketry be opened now turnbull do lippincott go to gun when be far enough off for to bear on rascal let have minute later bow gun be fired be too near for shot to spread properly cut lane through crowd minute later second gun crashed out by time sailor have loaded musket again now for volley nat shouted will finish be mistaken be indeed decisive with yell of rage pain negro darted into forest behind a fast a gun must be loaded round after round of grape be fired among tree by time schooner be close to kedge be hauled up sail set breeze be so light that vessel scarcely moved through water gun be again loaded with grape keen watch be kept a be possible that boat might not yet have arrived having delayed putting off until be thought that on board must be asleep in meantime wound be examined none of be serious only small proportion of negro be armed with musket being among crowd have for most part be unable to fire consequently only one man have be hit in arm by ball while six eight have received gash more le deep from knife other weapon of negro even if boat have not be here nat said to lippincott think will have trouble with will have heard gun dare say musketry firing will know now be awake on guard must probably sink before reached hour passed then a got beyond shelter of island caught little breeze schooner began to slip through water nat called men from gun think that will have more fighting to night said have done very well have certainly killed three time own number have successfully carried out main object of adventure have ordered steward to serve out good ration of rum round must advise who have got wound to keep share for few day wo hurt sir one old sailor said three four other voice be raised in assent did not suppose that advice must be taken nat said with laugh to turnbull still

day later a be at breakfast nat stopped a be raising cup to lip be gun exclaimed there be with two middy ran up on deck there be fight going on somewhere said a sound of firing be again heard must be six seven mile away somewhere beyond headland at rate will hold on have look at with light wind will take from hour half to two hour before be up with so may a well finish breakfast in comfort what be monsieur glover be noise really sound of gun there be doubt about there be fight going on seven eight mile away must hear sound more plainly be not that there be headland between vessel engaged who can be madame pickard said pirate merchantman doubt none of european nation be at war sea swarm with piratical craft of one kind small one content with plundering native coasting vessel larger one attack ship from to europe orpheus to belonged at time last year rooted out one of worst nest have fewer than four ship be lucky enough to catch one of learned where rendezvous be fortunately found other three at home destroyed storehouse be going on in direction now valerie asked yes be going to have look at if trader be making good fight of arrival may turn scale if arrive too late find enemy too big for can run away in light wind like there be very few vessel must catch be probable that must not interfere be not for possibility that may be in time to save of passenger crew of merchantman must be vessel of size judging from sound of gun even if have surrendered before get there find that be in way match for pirate might after defeating save at least of captive a rule scoundrel when opposition have ceased confine prisoner in hold after emptying prize of everything valuable scuttle of course drown on board in way trace of crime be lost whereas if killed of body might float inshore if burnt ship smoke might bring down cruiser happened to be in neighborhood be sorry that be on board lady oh think of madame pickard exclaimed after wonderful deliverance that have have be sure that none of must mind risk if there be chance of saving others in a dire peril a be two girl monsieur pickard warmly agreed please put altogether out of consideration latter said even if knew that be probable must lose life must not hesitate be not hope of afraid of death be kind of death that be terrified at thank nat said gravely will not fight unless think that there be at rate fair chance of victory on going on deck when breakfast be finished nat ordered magazine to be opened ammunition brought up wind have freshened little schooner be going faster through water in three quarter of hour after hearing first gun neared promontory be afraid be over nat said to lady who have also come on deck there have not be gun fired for past two three minute however will soon see on rounding point saw two vessel lying side by side mile half distant about mile from shore one be barque evidently large merchantman other brigantine there be question that latter be pirate other prize sailor after glance at turned eye anxiously towards nat for order latter stood quietly examining ship through glass mount five gun side must say that be about same weight a own said to turnbull from men swarming on deck that of prize must have nearly if not quite three time strength even counting frenchman in be too big to fight squarely sir turnbull reluctantly agreed be afraid be altogether too tough customer for yet one hate thought of leaving to complete devil work on prize yes ca think of doing mr turnbull first thing to do will be to draw off from must be sure to leave of men in possession of well if do there will be so many fewer for to fight be within mile now must say yes sir then train two forward gun on let see that mean fighting cheer broke from sailor clustered round gun a turnbull gave order now lady nat said can stop to see effect of first shot then must ask to go down on to lower deck sam will show way take cushion down for will be out of danger there a spoke two gun be already loaded be fired men gave cheer a two white patch appeared on side of brigantine please hurry down lady nat said checking entreaty saw be going to make wo be long before answer give round lad said a reluctantly obeyed order get in if can before be ready busy a be pirate have not observed schooner until gun be fired with shout of alarm ran back to own ship be succeeded by exclamation of anger surprise when saw how small be craft have thus intruded into affair by captain order twenty of crew under first mate returned to deck of prize portion of men ran to gun others threw off grapnel fastening to prize before be ready to fire two more shot from schooner crashed into brigantine one passing through bulwark killing three men wounding several others with splinter other struck within few inch of water line schooner at once bore up discharging gun on starboard side a came round laying course a close to wind a must be jammed showed stern to pirate two of gun forward be fired others must not be brought to bear arrow be now almost retracing course for wind be west west must just follow line of coast here come after turnbull said rubbing hand a savage a bee whose hive have be disturbed now mr turnbull get two gun right aft so a to fire over taffrail must see if can not knock of spar away a soon a have moved gun let hand except serving go forward lie down there weight of gun will put rather by stern want to let that fellow come nearer to be in best trim now a soon a gun be ready opened fire brigantine answered with bow chaser a be obliged to yaw time brought to bear presently ceased firing be gaining on sir lippincott said a watched pirate through glass yes sailing fully point nearer to wind than doe get stay sail fastened to rope drop over close to bow want to run away from if found that be too fast for must give up chase go back to prize want to gain just enough to encourage to keep on be fast craft be faster will be able to manage providing doe not knock away of spar start schooner have made have at first widened distance between there be now mile quarter of water separating brigantine be hulled several time sail pierced spar be still intact be permitted to gain until be little more than mile astern schooner have weathered on be now nearly mile to windward if have open sea on side instead of land turnbull said be to cut away sail must not see again must have come to same conclusion a be doubt think that clawing out to windward be of advantage to now get gun over to larboard side be lucky that there be spare port there must make effort to knock one of spar out may cripple for by time brigantine have again opened fire let three best shot have got lay gun on mainmast tell to train rather high so that if miss mark may cut one of halyard will give start want gun be run into position on broadside hurry over nat said let fire a gun come to bear there be crash cry a spoke ball have gone through arrow from side to side tearing jagged hole through bulwark one of sailor being struck to deck by splinter one spoke eye being fixed on gun be fired almost together there be pause for second two then burst of cheering a gaff of great mainsail of brigantine be seen to collapse be hit close to jaw turnbull whose glass be levelled on pirate exclaimed cut away sail in water nat shouted up with helm men bring round be right went on a schooner came up into wind payed off on other tack now slack away sheet three gun be vengefully fired by pirate sudden change in schooner position disconcerted aim shot flew wide without waiting for order seaman at two of gun ran over to starboard side working at highest pressure poured shot after shot into brigantine answered slowly a number of men have run aloft to get sail down to repair damage before be under way again schooner have left mile behind be now on best point of sailing while brigantine be to extent crippled by mainsail setting badly by time headland be again passed schooner be fully two mile ahead crew have for time be puzzled at action being so abruptly concluded turnbull have even ventured to say must think sir must have fair chance with now not very good chance have be lucky with ten gun to four strong crew of desperate men must be very awkward customer can think of later on plan be to retake prize before can come up be not likely that have killed crew yet expect captain told left behind to leave thing a be until returned may scarcely be match for brigantine prize together must be able to give good account of ourselves splendid sir turnbull exclaimed joyously be grand idea have gun loaded with grape nat said quietly run two of over to other side will go outside prize bring craft up into wind shoot up inside give one broadside then board tell men to have pistol cutlass ready distribute boarding pike among frenchman a soon a rounded point must see by glass that there be sudden commotion on deck of merchantman did not expect to see back first lippincott laughed even now must think be expecting to see brigantine close behind in chase suspect what be up to head straight for said to helmsman take couple of length outside pirate indeed be completely deceived when at last saw that brigantine did not appear ran over to gun be however too late two three of be discharged a schooner passed beyond making hole in sail damage be done one of schooner gun poured in volley of grape when be two three length ahead helm be put hard down flew round just caught wind on other tack gliding up alongside merchantman three gun being discharged in succession a two vessel touched grapnel be thrown sailor frenchman leapt on to deck headed by three officer nearly pirate have be killed wounded by four discharge of grape remainder made poor fight of be cut down to man off with hatch men nat shouted run down release crew ran aft into saloon here six gentleman eight ten lady be lying bound hand foot several of men be wounded nat at once cut cord illustration captain of pirate shook fist in defiance be safe said ship have be retaken by majesty schooner arrow have not done with brigantine yet of who have weapon can use may lend hand without waiting to listen to chorus of cry of gratitude ran out again minute later number of seaman poured up on deck many of be wounded how many be there of asked officer among there be thirty of said have lost nearly crew before boarded captain be killed early in fight a be first officer well sir set men to load gun at once there be brigantine just coming round point monsieur pickard will remain here with party help sailor get sail sheeted home sir went on to ship officer be vessel fast one yes be not so fast a brigantine be of consequence nat said get sail can on now get twenty of men on board again mr lippincott on second thought will take five of frenchman mr turnbull will remain on board in command of ship with other five of men endeavour will be to knock away one of mast do keep a close a can to will board together one on side if knock away one of spar will a far a possible come back to meet if follows will fight together understand sir moment push off get head sail aback put on wind so a to get out of way will fill off on other tack then come round join will keep together until see whether mean to fight run remember great thing be to knock spar out of so saying leapt on to deck of schooner turnbull voice be at once heard shouting order haul aft weather sheet of jib in minute two vessel be gliding away from other on opposite tack then arrow be brought round followed thames be name of merchantman brigantine be now three quarter of mile away suddenly be seen to change course a wore round presented broadside to two vessel five gun puffed out together reply from merchantman arrow followed almost simultaneously cheer rang out from ship a pirate bowsprit be seen to snap off place two three cable length from larboard quarter nat shouted turnbull who have leapt on to rail to see result of broadside waved hand down topsail nat shouted will be handier without in moment two great sail came fluttering down turnbull followed example men ran up ratline furled of upper sail deprived of head sail pirate be unmanageable two vessel speedily ran up laid couple of hundred yard from quarter opened steady fire pirate endeavoured to drag two of gun right aft volley of grape poured into be too much for although captain be seen to shoot two of men rest ran forward helmsman deserted now useless post give one more broadside nat shouted to turnbull then run in board captain of pirate mad with rage leapt on to taffrail shook fist in defiance at moment two rifle cracked out from merchantman fell forward into sea effect of storm of grape from three gun of schooner four from trader among men huddled up in bow of pirate be terrible knowing that life be forfeited if be taken prisoner none made movement aft to haul down black flag still floated from peak in two three minute antagonist be alongside volley of musketry be poured in then crew of ship leapt on to deck pirate who be now reduced to about thirty men rushed to meet determining to sell life dearly odds be against missed voice of captain to encourage when twenty of number have fallen remainder threw down arm let man stir foot to go below nat shouted remembering explosion in pirate hold fearing that one of might make straight for magazine have not used pistol in fight now stood with one in hand pointing threateningly to enforce order mr lippincott take four men below close securely fasten magazine middy ran down returned in two three minute to report that have executed order tie fellow foot hand nat said carry down into hold when be done be able to look round deck be perfect shamble brigantine a afterwards heard carried originally eighty hand ten of have be either killed seriously wounded in fight with thames twenty have be killed on board that barque when be retaken forty lay dead dying on deck one of frenchman have fallen six of sailor three frenchman have be severely wounded turnbull somewhat seriously wounded lippincott slightly monsieur pickard male passenger on board thames have joined boarder two of have previously done good service with rifle have not pirate leader be killed fight must have be even more desperate one of passenger be fortunately surgeon at once set to work attending to sailor wound after have bandaged examined of pirate have for most part be killed outright of wounded there be four five with prospect of recovery first attended to while other passenger carried water to dying men now lad nat said clear deck of dead get up awning carry who be alive into shade dead pirate be thrown over without ceremony body of frenchman being laid down by compatriot by one of gun for proper burial in evening a soon a fight be over monsieur pickard who after capture of thames have gone below to assure wife daughter that be going on well that have saved nine lady six gentleman from hand of pirate hurried down with welcome news that fight be over brigantine captured can go up to cabin said come on deck till come down tell that everything have be made clean tidy will be glad to hear that although have several wounded francois amond be only man have be killed one of passenger of thames have carried similar news to lady there crew of be at once set to work to wash deck in hour holy stone have obliterated worst sign of conflict though must require many more scrubbing before stain of blood entirely disappeared time vessel have remained side by side lady now ventured on to deck of thames arrow what do intend to do sir one of passenger asked nat will sail at once for jamaica said will want more hand must at present borrow few from for own men be not sufficiently strong to navigate own craft prize wind be favourable if hold a be will be at kingston in forty eight hour so there will be no great loss of time then crossed to arrow must congratulate most heartily on success madame pickard said be wonderful indeed that must have taken vessel pirate ship be must think three time a big a be other look giant by side yes be six hundred ton brigantine be about three hundred however have gone very fortunately in first place have rescued fifteen gentleman lady twice a many seaman from death that must certainly have met with in next place have thrashed pirate will get credit prize money good sum for recapture of thames chief officer have just told carry very valuable cargo lastly be happy to say that although several of crew be injured have not lost single life among be sorry that one of men fell in fight have sadly spoiled appearance of ship valerie pickard said there be three four great hole along side ball have gone through cabin sail be so white pretty have lot of hole in yes will want good many new cloth said be very minor matter monsieur turnbull be hurt hear yes madame happily be not very serious blow only partly parried struck on shoulder look very serious wound doctor say there be need for great uneasiness about being seriously wounded in action have advantage a always count towards promotion mr lippincott have have one of ear nearly slashed off be not pretty to look at at present with head done up in bandage surgeon think that a be attended to so soon be likely that will heal up have escaped altogether monsieur glover louise said yes for once have have good luck hitherto have always come out of fight more le damaged time have escaped without scratch must feel very proud if be girl said at having done so much with small ship so young too why look more than year two older than valerie have rescued people on other ship taken pirate vessel have captured seems almost impossible look so quiet nice too louise must not talk like mother corrected nat said gravely mademoiselle do know that be talking to commander of one of majesty ship on own quarter deck where be a be monarch of survey might inflict sort of terrible punishment upon for want of respect girl laughed merrily be not afraid said not one little bit see why must mind being told that be young quiet looking nice when be mind in least said certainly be young can assure that former captain must not tell be quiet for have reputation of being most troublesome middy on board frigate see responsibility have sobered can assure that there be great deal of responsibility in commanding small craft like have nothing speed luck to rely on if happens to fall in with strongly armed vessel how can say that monsieur valerie said indignantly when have taken pirate be ever so much stronger than be there may be little good management in more luck mademoiselle if one of shot have damaged instead of one of mine damaging must have have throat cut two hour ago believe said believe that must have beaten anyhow lady very often think what wish said with laugh doubt must have fought to last can assure that must have have chance with best must have done for must have be to have fired last shot of pistol into magazine please talk about madame pickard said with shudder now suppose that have have fighting enough be going to carry quietly into port yes madame to jamaica if must prefer to be landed at cape francois port au prince will be happy to give passage back again want to go there at husband will go to wind up affair sell house there have be talking over agree that must never like to go back to estate again even if thing did quiet down memory be too terrible besides having once broken out black might do so again at time think be perfectly right madame be afraid will not get much for estate husband think that although white man must buy there be plenty of mulatto who must give not real value certain amount for many of be rich men who have already large plantation ours be one of most valuable on island with title from purchaser must not be afraid of being disturbed when soldier arrive put down insurrection while even if must never be done negro with whom mulatto be now friend must not interfere with husband think that perhaps will get third of value must be sufficient to keep comfortably in france wherever may settle best resource be that have whole of last season produce stored in magazine at port au prince be not until next afternoon that absolutely necessary repair to three vessel be completed hole near water line covered by plank over pitched canvas be nailed rope shot away replaced by new one brigantine gaff repaired then sail be hoisted again three vessel set sail for kingston where arrived on evening of third day after starting little excitement be caused in harbour when arrow with sail side bearing mark of engagement sailed in followed by brigantine flying british ensign over black flag thames with same flag with addition of merchant ensign under black flag following there be two three ship of war in port crew saluted arrow with hearty cheer flag ship at once ran up signal for commander to come on board leaving lippincott to see to operation of anchoring nat ordered gig to be lowered taking place in be rowed to flag ship chapter xiv attack on port au prince on mounting to deck nat be at once taken to admiral cabin so have be disobeying order lieutenant glover said gravely hope not sir be not conscious of disobeying order fancy be directed not to engage more heavily armed craft than own be sir circumstance be peculiar never knew midshipman young lieutenant mr glover who did not find circumstance peculiar when wanted to disobey order however added with smile let hear peculiar circumstance then will be able to judge how far be justified give in full have written report yes sir have brought with nat said producing document well lay down on table suppose be very full be somewhat curious to hear how brought in pirate brigantine recaptured merchantman so understood flag nat related how have heard sound of gun on rounding headland have seen brigantine lying by side of barque have evidently just captured how drew off in pursuit of schooner partially crippled returned retook thames released crew placed mr turnbull in command how between have captured brigantine very smart action admiral said cordially when have brought narrative to conclusion doe very great credit fully justifies appointing to independent command what metal doe brigantine carry five gun side twelve pounder like own have only four yes sir very good indeed very good by way do know of passenger on board thames personally observed three lady on deck a came in must have thought that must have have very much better accommodation on trader than on board little craft yes sir be on board arrow before fight with brigantine although first mate of thames offered state cabin preferred to stay on board a be such short run here who be then be refugee sir got out of hand of negro three lady husband of elder one seven other white men be there story attached to mr glover let see what do say about in report opened read aloud have honour sir to report that learning there be white family in hand of negro landed with party brought off consisted of monsieur madame pickard two daughter seven of white employee casualty eight seaman wounded none of seriously then come account of other affair now please give detail of rescue business a minutely a possible nat did very risky business mr glover though see how must have acted in other way british officer hope must have be deaf to appeal if boat have found schooner when be away position must have be well nigh desperate must sir quite felt that seemed to only possible thing to do of course if have known that boat must have come early in evening must have remained on board beat off before making landing although chance of success must then have be much smaller party who be to attack in boat be to have be composed of men from plantation comrade must doubtless have come down to shore to see captured when saw friend beaten off must have be on watch not improbably in fury disappointment have massacred captive in hand at once thought likely that boat must not put off before believed to be asleep must therefore have time to go up to plantation fetch captive down before arrived at rate by moving schooner close inshore hoped that boat might not find there be moon under shadow of rock be next to impossible to see unless boat happened to pas within few pace having struck topmast forest behind on steep ground prevented mast from showing above sky line be of course choice of two evil took one seemed to to give greater promise of success did excellently oldest officer in service must not have done better will be obliged if will write a full detailed account of affair a have given will send home with official report with own remark upon now about merchantman look fine barque what be tonnage six hundred ton sir be nearly new vessel sail fast for ship of kind first mate told that have very valuable cargo on board principally think tobacco sugar coffee wax copper mahogany cedar from cuba passenger be spanish seems to be valuable prize a recaptured from pirate there will be handsome sum to be divided be fortunate for officer that little craft be commissioned independently not a tender to one of frigate a be except flag share will all fall to yourselves crew how many men have lost none at sir though a will see by report in two affair greater part of received more le severe wound mr turnbull be somewhat severely wounded mr lippincott nearly lost ear escaped altogether well be turn lieutenant glover have come back three time more le severely hurt already say that brigantine be fast yes sir be not so fast a schooner in light wind so weatherly in anything like strong wind have doubt that must overhaul be there anything in hold there be good many bale case sir have not opened by mark come from three different ship have doubt captured sunk before fell in with questioned one of prisoner told that be only month since came out declared that have not yet chosen place a head quarter a others questioned separately told same story imagine that be true where did hail from came from bordeaux said that have taken out letter of marque to act a privateer in case of war breaking out with fancy that be from first intended for pirate for seems that have only forty hand when started picked up others at various french port at touched before sailing west must say from appearance of crew that be composed of sweeping of port for more villainous set of rascal never saw well be fortunate that must have stopped career so soon might have given great deal of trouble before laid hand on have have comparatively quiet time since orpheus destroyed that nest of if have confined work to homeward bound ship might have be month before have complaint from home found that there be of scourge among island will row around presently mr glover have look at two prize when see gig coming will be obliged if will meet on deck of brigantine at four o'clock in afternoon watch on deck reported that admiral gig be being lowered nat immediately got into own boat be rowed to brigantine whose name be agile when admiral approached instead of making straight for accommodation ladder rowed slowly round vessel making very careful examination of hull when came on deck said except for few shot hit low down general destruction of bulwark damage have be done to sir aimed high great object being to knock away of spar think that square sail will be of use in future be riddled with ball from stern chaser new gaff bowsprit new suit of sail new bulwark few patch must be a good a ever what damage have suffered schooner have dozen hole in bow sir dozen so in sail nothing that dockyard must not set right in fortnight then went below excellent accommodation said after going round be for fair crew must have be crowded indeed with eighty men what must consider to be fair crew for mr glover twenty men sir if be simple trader must say from thirty five to forty must be none too much if be going to fight gun now will have look at craft may a well take seat in gig yes went on a rowed round a have done with brigantine now that sail be furled doe not seem worse for except in bow two hole in bulwark monsieur pickard lady be seated on deck rose a admiral came on board please introduce to friend mr glover nat did so admiral shook hand with think may congratulate on escape from very terrible position yes indeed madame pickard said word can express gratitude feel to monsieur glover two officer crew position seemed hopeless most terrible of death worst of atrocity stared in face have heard about madame consider lieutenant glover managed whole business with great discretion a well a bravery have bad habit of getting into scrape equally good one of getting out of with credit to be third time have rendered signal service to lady in distress suppose must add that have in addition saved life of lady on board barque lying astern if there be medal for sort of thing must assuredly deserve ought to have be born six seven hundred year ago must have made delightful knight errant be lady like in other ship mr have idea sir only saw for moment when ran into cabin cut bond have only seen gentleman for minute two when joined boarder from thames under mr turnbull be much too busy to notice have not gone on board since sir have nothing to go on board for speak spanish tried to persuade monsieur l'amiral valerie said monsieur be modest have never let thank yet although pretended that only kept ahead of other two because ship be faster sailer be really because did not wish to be thanked other people be modest too admiral said with smile have heard of two young lady who came on board who must not stir out of cabin until have made new dress two girl coloured up at allusion monsieur pickard laughed now will go below mr glover be very small by side of brigantine said a completed visit of inspection be not surprised that pirate chased after impudence in firing at that thought must eat at mouthful now will pay visit to barque to nat great relief found that passenger have gone ashore be certain that must be detained for little time a there must be legal formality to be gone through repair to be executed additional hand to be obtained feeling terribly shaken by event have taken place on board loss in case of near relation have be glad to land until ship be again ready for sea mate in charge handed to admiral ship manifest paper have seriously wounded on board latter asked because if so must advise to send ashore to hospital at once sir who fell on deck be thrown overboard by pirate a soon a obtained possession of ship believe that fastened shot to foot to make sink at once admiral nodded be likely enough dead body drifting ashore might cause inquiry to be made intention doubt be to take most valuable part of cargo out of ship then to scuttle with on board be likely to be detained here long sir not a far a be concerned will require to sign in presence of magistrate here formal document acknowledging that vessel be absolutely captured in possession of pirate that be recaptured by majesty schooner arrow to sign bond on behalf of owner to pay legal proportion of value of ship cargo to admiralty prize court in london will of course take home yourself will send naval officer with a ship content remain property of government until charge upon be acquitted if be at war with france must retain here until must sail under convoy of vessel of war homeward bound there be occasion for doing now suppose that will find much difficulty in obtaining mate enough sailor to make up complement here scarcely ship sail from port without of men being left behind a deserter through having be too drunk to rejoin at rate have better be careful whom pick if must find difficulty in obtaining men whose discharge book show that have hitherto borne good character must advise to ship eight ten stout negro be good hand at managing own craft although might not be of much use aloft be a rule thoroughly trustworthy fellow quite a good for work on deck a own men will give order on dockyard for repair that can not get executed elsewhere will of course be charged for need not be paid for here a will go down in account against ship fortunately dockyard be not busy agile arrow be next morning taken into dock strong gang of men at once set to work upon three day later signal be made for nat to go on board flagship have received report from dockyard people mr glover admiral said confirm opinion that agile have not suffered serious damage that be new well built vessel well fitted for service will therefore be retained at valuation set upon here be commission a commander having done so well in little arrow have doubt a to ability fitness for post will carry forty hand will give two petty officer boatswain mate gunner mate have thought of giving midshipman think must be better that must take surgeon three four assistant surgeon came out last week can very well spare one will not give one of new arrival for be better that for time must serve on larger ship get accustomed to naval work learn ordinary routine of duty on board will therefore send one from theseus limerick fill up place with new comer duty will be precisely same a assigned to in arrow except will not impress upon necessity for giving wide berth to suspicious vessel will cruise on coast of hayti take off refugee communicate if possible with chief of insurgent see if there be strong feeling among in favour of annexation to england will be authorized in case be absolutely necessary in order to save inhabitant of coast town from slaughter from black to help garrison with gun to land portion not exceeding half crew to aid in defence be indeed greatly obliged to admiral assure will do best to merit kindness confidence be to rather than to that be indebted for what be virtually step towards promotion just at present think that be likely to have opportunity of taking advantage of increased force a have heard complaint of pirate of late may hope that scoundrel finding that island be growing too hot for have moved away to safer quarter at rate if there be of in water be likely to be among northern cay be probably confining depredation for time to ship trading between europe florida to vessel from here have passed beyond general limit of sea patrol on nat return to dockyard delighted lippincott with news of exchange that be to make turnbull be in hospital surgeon have reported that wound be not so serious a seemed at first that fortnight rest quiet must go far to render convalescent sailor too be glad to hear that be going to be transferred to craft in must be able to meet enemy with confidence be also pleased to hear that there be to be change in officer for have unbounded trust in young commander have from first agreed that have never sailed in more

short time till madame girl get quite accustomed to new home before sailing for port au prince whether be at home away know how welcome will be here whenever happen to be in port how long do think be likely to be before be off be speaking to superintendent of dockyard before came out say that will get agile ready for sea in three week time can not possibly manage before hull must be ready in week suit of sail will require three time a long though have promised to take on extra hand if can get order have however be given by thames to chief native sail maker of place to patch of sail to make several new one have taken up of best hand in town then doubt whoever get command of arrow will be wanting sail pushed forward though be not certain for be not unlikely that now agile have be bought into service arrow will be sold indeed one of principal merchant here must be glad to buy a private yacht if have chance a often have business at other island be just craft must suit said that by putting up shorter topmast twelve men must be enough to sail that must exchange gun for eight pounder a from what have heard must outsail almost craft be likely to meet with small gun must be quite sufficient to prevent of little native piratical craft from meddling with however think superintendent will keep word that in three week time will be off may possibly be at port au prince before then monsieur pickard said be thinking of chartering small brig going in to port au prince bringing good back from there now that mulatto be up in arm place can not be considered a absolutely safe a calculate be worth from eight to ten thousand pound think will be well to get over a soon a possible quite agree with monsieur pickard must certainly advise to lose time unless get instruction to contrary will in first place cruise round shore of bay of hayti ten day later indeed monsieur pickard sailed in brig that have chartered nat have called to say good bye evening before to embarrassment be presented by with very handsome gold watch chain former bearing inscription that be small token of deepest gratitude of eugene pickard wife daughter for having saved from most terrible fate be only little thing monsieur glover planter said feeble token of gratitude something many year hence will recall to memory inestimable service that have rendered superintendent of dockyard kept word in three week agile be afloat again next morning twenty men drafted from war ship in port be transferred to of arrow with exception of five still in hospital have shifted quarter to fortnight previously turnbull have rejoined evening before arm be still in sling otherwise be quite convalescent lippincott have that morning given up bandage round head have kept almost prisoner until now for have

doyle cheery young irishman also joined that morning be glad be to be out of ceremony botheration on board frigate said a shook hand with nat to be afloat on own account a be saunders surgeon be enough to wear one out with preciseness regulation faith be man who must rather take off man leg than listen to joke put on thorn to hear speak to men a if be one of shamming a if anyone must pretend to be ill when have to take bastely medicine saunders used to make up for think will find much shamming here doctor especially if new hand be a good a others hope that service will not often be required except in matter of wound fighting mean wound be afraid that there be hope of fighting surgeon said shaking head mournfully orpheus have pretty well cleared out pirate be case of pure luck that came across craft other day there be doubt that orpheus men have have luck big ship turn wo come till have war with france however may be that luck will stick to for bit yet for by faith will before long have forgotten how to take off limb to tie up artery for want of practice envied when came in other day with two prize behind big enough to have eaten up though cheered there be many man who grumbled ce to orpheus men have got luck orpheus have nothing to do with nat laughed know that have be one of men have a have heard more than share already of adventure nat have received no further order sailed afternoon two day later be off entrance of great bay coasted along shore a near a must venture always keeping man on watch for signal made by anyone anxious to be taken off when became dark anchor be dropped so that part of shore must be passed without ship being observed be on seventh day after sailing that arrived at port au prince hour after have anchored monsieur pickard came off in boat be lucky that lost time said after first greeting be over got last bale of good on board brig hour ago be going to warp out at once so a to be under shelter of gun why what be matter there be news that large force of mulatto negro be coming down from hill will be here probably to morrow morning luckily great part of negro be turned out of town fortnight ago there be only two hundred soldier here about a many white volunteer little enough to defend place if attack doubt chose moment because there be not french war ship of kind in port however think that white woman child be on board ship be crowded have about twenty on board brig have rigged up sail a awning on warm night a will sleep better there than must in cabin can assure that there be greatest satisfaction when be seen coming in several of captain have talked of towing vessel out three four mile into bay a soon a be certain that be armed ship idea be given up a many of be only half laden be felt that of nationality be must prevent negro from coming off in boat to murder woman child of course did not know that be until made out figure from shore a soon a did so told knew that need not trouble about safety of on board ship for must answer for that must not hesitate to turn gun on boat went out to attack well monsieur pickard can not believe that town will be taken at rate congratulate on having got produce board yes be very important matter to can not calculate upon finding purchaser for house at cape francois at anything approaching value at ordinary time have couple of thousand pound lying at banker although six month ago must not have taken forty thousand for estate slave upon suppose may consider fortunate if get sum even le now anyhow if get crop here safe to jamaica need not worry a to future if place be attacked in morning monsieur have admiral authority to land men to aid in defence though twenty men be small number may render assistance intend to hold in reserve to take to spot at insurgent may be pressing back defender will be obliged if will inform officer in command of troop civil authority that can count on assistance to extent will give advice to get available boat ranged along by quay opposite to so that in case of worst can retreat there will cover embarkation with gun lastly must advise captain of ship in port to tow vessel out range behind so that there may be nothing to interfere with line of fire will inform committee of defence directly go ashore will doubtless send off at once to order various ship to anchor at spot indicate will be relief indeed to to know that have undertaken protection will go ashore with nat said though have landed here more than once know place well enough to be able to act quickly must like to see exactly where battery be placed where be most likely that negro will make chief attack went ashore landed together walked to house where principal men of town be assembled will come in with monsieur pickard asked will leave to explain what propose to do what recommend that must do there be sure to be lot of talk discussion wish to lose time sun will be setting in hour so will make round at once passing through town nat visited various battery have be erected decided that if black be well led must work round attack remains of native town battery have principally be erected round european quarter a if enemy coming from hill must be certain to make direct attack while native quarter be almost entirely undefended although with once in possession of enemy whole town must lie open to be clear that be real point of danger muttered fortunately from where be lying gun can sweep widest street run down through quarter will mention idea to pickard doubt be still talking away at meeting went back to house m pickard dozen other gentleman be standing at door m pickard at once introduced to object in coming round here gentleman be to tell that in opinion defence be quite strong enough to protect town against body of negro coming down on easterly side be wholly insufficient to repel attack if made on native town trust therefore when troop man defence considerable number of at least will be so placed a to be ready to meet attack from side there be practically nothing to prevent negro from entering there a many of mulatto with must be perfectly aware of position of battery be scarcely likely to propose to make attack upon knowing that negro must not be able to face artillery fire must lead round to attack almost defenceless native portion of town have always reckoned upon coming upon by one of main road from hill one of gentleman said so see monsieur of mulatto with be men of considerable intelligence must be hardly foolish enough to try to break down door that have closed against when know that there be open entrance at back if there be man with smallest spark of military genius about will commence attack by feint in considerable force against battery then under cover of smoke of gun own for hear from monsieur pickard that be said to have fifteen twenty gun have taken at small place on coast will send round main body of force to fall on native town be opinion gentleman know very little of military matter seems to be course that man of moderate intelligence must pursue therefore must strongly advise at least volunteer force must take post to defend native town so give time to remainder to come up assist in defence will post sailor in position where can best aid in defence in direction will have gun of ship in readiness to open fire on native town if be driven back thank sir will have meeting late evening will do best to urge committee to act a suggest nat returned on board agile already most of ship in port have anchored short distance outside brigantine few have kept on until last moment taking cargo on board be being towed by boat in same direction turnbull lippincott be anxiously awaiting nat return retiring into cabin told result of investigation of defence position on shore think will have hot work to morrow went on if negro be not absolute fool will not knock head against battery there be twenty cannon in position for most part ship gun a hear that have plenty of ammunition especially grape must simply mow nigger down if attacked there be only one battery with three gun covering native town black ought to have difficulty in carrying with rush have learnt by experience that fault can fight furiously be ready enough to risk life thus battery may be taken in few minute if hundred of volunteer held hut behind might check for time a negro be several thousand strong resistance can not be long best point of defence will be that street facing here gun will come into play be there that will join french a fall back will get mr lippincott to row round evening to craft near to request captain in name to send men provided with musket may have on board a soon a firing be heard will remain on board in charge turnbull with arm in sling be not fit for fighting on shore with twenty men ought to be able to work gun pretty fast between shot men with musket must aid of course must use grape if attack lull in least send few round shot among house on side pomp sam have better go ashore with act a boat keeper will take boat higher up than of townspeople for if panic seizes there must be mad rush to get on board will go couple of hundred yard farther boat will lie short distance out not come in close till see running towards in way can make sure of being able to get on board must certainly have liked to land turnbull said know that be not fit yet for hard fighting suppose will be taking along with doyle said by mean come if like be not thinking of doing so be not often that get chance of taking share in fun a rule a soon a gun be loaded ready for action have to go below to stop there bandaging dressing wound with not chance of seeing what be going on be just one chance in hundred must be no good here for there be one to look after will take with two three tourniquet bandage perchance may be mean of saving poor boy life while not so engaged may have slap at murdering black be pretty good shot when man can bring down ten snipe out of dozen a have done time after time in ould country ought to be able to put bullet into black man carcass if be bent upon going by mean do so a say tourniquet clapped on directly man be wounded may save life additional musket will be valuable addition to strength chapter xv attack on port au prince be just getting light on following morning when sound of cannon be heard be followed by several other shot mingled with rattle of distant musketry town woke up with start drum beat in street in minute two men armed with rifle musket poured out from house hurried to rendezvous settled upon night before firing came from eastern side of town three battery in direction be engaged mingled with report of gun came sound of more distant cannonade showing that insurgent artillery be also at work among shipping there be a great excitement a in town on board ship men be running up ratline to see if view of scene of action must be obtained from aloft on deck number of woman who have hastily thrown on upper clothing wrapped in shawl listened anxiously to sound of firing scarce one have husband brother son among defender of place there be ten vessel lying outside agile from of boat presently put off to brigantine with three four men others with a many a ten armed with musket will soon see how matter go turnbull whether be real only feigned attack landing party be in few minute ready to embark man carried fifty round of ammunition for musket dozen additional cartridge for pistol water bottle be slung over shoulder have hunch of bread of cold meat have be boiled in galley night before in readiness took place in cutter gig be soon rowed ashore to point nat have fixed on previous evening various boat lighter used in loading ship have be gathered at quay facing agile nat be pleased to see that advice in respect have be followed order to sam pomp who be to remain one in boat be that must push boat out a far a head rope have be lengthened for occasion must allow drop small grapnel over stern must then keep sharp look out moment party be seen returning be to pull up grapnel haul on head rope till boat be alongside be armed order be that be to shoot anyone who must try to force into boat before sailor came up nat led party to empty house close to street commanded by agile gun six of sailor be placed a sentinel at end of street running into rest piled arm now mr lippincott will be obliged if will go ascertain how affair be proceeding whether battery be keeping insurgent well in check be about to start for battery on side where will get fair view of country round see how matter stand will remain here mr thompson went on to boatswain in charge of party will take newman with in case have order to send to will come with also doyle two officer followed by active young seaman started on arriving near end of native town nat be glad to see group of volunteer in front of saluted a came up what force have here gentleman asked fifty men captain must have be better if have be hundred fifty if come here in force will not be able to keep at bay long where be main body be gathered in front of municipal office in readiness to move service may be most required be quite satisfactory be afraid that most of might be at battery at other side of town where troop ought to be quite able to hold own against black at moment gentleman with red sash over shoulder came up be commander of company stationed there be afraid that be rather out of monsieur said after exchanging salute with nat be still more afraid sir that be by mean out of think that will find that before many minute be over will be hotly engaged have come forward to tell that men be placed just on other side of royal street to beg that if be not able to maintain yourselves here if be attacked be convinced that will be in such force that will be unable to do so will not endanger force by holding on here too long will retreat to royal street there make stand occupying house on other side of street gun of vessel be loaded in readiness to sweep street with grape a negro try to cross will have in addition forty fifty men from merchantman outside who will aid in keeping in check if might advise must say that must be well for to write note now that have time to do so saying that be attacked in overwhelming force be about to fall back to royal street will aided by sailor gun hold to last begging commander to send whole force up to support will of course keep until attack come will send off a soon a perceive that position here be untenable think be very good suggestion officer said will carry out at once will go on to battery nat said from there will get better idea of situation have scarcely gone beyond line of house when french soldier came running in what be news nat asked great crowd of enemy be coming captain have sent to beg commander of volunteer here to bring up force to support will find hundred yard farther on now doctor will go forward have look arriving at battery be manned by twenty french soldier under young lieutenant nat doctor mounted parapet enemy be still mile away be in sort of order be coming on in confused mass there must be three four thousand of lieutenant nat said quietly may check little will never keep out of town if come on with rush suppose be loaded with grape yes monsieur young frenchman said felt relieved at arrival of commander of british ship of war for be feeling responsibility of position greatly must let get within four five hundred yard nat said quietly then fire gun singly loading a rapidly a possible here come volunteer place five twenty of on side of battery let lie down open fire when enemy be within two hundred fifty yard if come on in spite of fire must say that have best retire at double will be of use trying to hold house must only outflank cut off have already arranged with volunteer that will make stand at royal street have party of sailor there in readiness to help a gun of ship will sweep street must certainly be able to hold until help arrives thank monsieur will do a suggest at moment volunteer came up at run where do wish to place men captain said to french lieutenant will be obliged if will put half of on side of battery let lie down there open fire when enemy be within two hundred fifty yard if when get within hundred yard fire ours doe not stop will then retreat together at double if be once surrounded must have chance whatever give gun elevation of five hundred yard said to men when be done looked inquiringly at other nodded yes think be about five hundred yard then turned to seaman go back a quickly a can newman tell mr thompson that black be coming that will probably be with five minute after arrive tell also to send man down a have arranged to wharf to signal to ship to be in readiness a spoke first of gun boomed out few second later second be fired be followed by third at similar interval cannon be old ship gun have be heavily charged with grape destruction wrought upon crowded mass of negro be so great that stopped suddenly several of leader be seen to rush to front waving gesticulating with wild yell negro again advanced have gone fifty yard when gun be first fired spoke out again followed quickly by others time there be pause in advance yelling furiously negro who be armed with gun discharged at random two more round be fired then crakle of rifle musket of volunteer broke out centre of negro line paused indecisively flank continued on way without check be just a thought nat said to doctor who be loading firing piece rapidly do see how flank be extending one more round lieutenant then have best be going will be cut off from town again three gun be discharged execution be terrible in centre of black line flank still kept on now captain get men together nat said to civilian officer who be standing beside if go to right will go to left wo hear voice in din half minute soldier volunteer be running at top of speed keeping well together towards town have hundred fifty yard start also advantage that black have be coming forward at run for over mile therefore although latter came on with yell of triumph exultation did not gain on little party indeed when once entered native town french considerably increased distance for negro fearing that might fall into ambush came along more carefully post men at window of house opposite to nat said to french lieutenant did send messenger on asked a ran up to volunteer officer latter gave exclamation of horror forgot about so did must have reminded of give to one of men now tell to take a hard a can run tell men off in three four to house opposite have doubt can keep in check till help come thompson be waiting in street a party ran up where have posted men nat asked thought most likely that must come down street so put four men in of two house facing seven be in two house facing next street coming down rest be here nat hurried up to french officer men be in two house facing next street will occupy house next tell officer of volunteer to scatter men in two three in other house doctor have better join party in house facing next street do mr thompson place with five men in house facing street beyond will have brunt of for be more likely to come by street than by near harbour knowing a do ship be lying anchored off there be three four minute before nat from window at have posted saw great body of negro mulatto coming along street facing open fire at once lad said take good aim shot ought to tell in crowd fire will let know on board that black be close at hand yelling shouting brandishing weapon insurgent poured down fire from next two party have showed that negro be also advancing by street above minute later three black column poured into royal street a did so fire broke out from window facing then came deep roar storm of grape swept along street followed with yell of surprise fear rioter rushed back into shelter leaving street strewn with dead dying be minute before must rally in meantime three of gun of agile sent ball after ball among house to west of street three time did negro attempt to cross fatal road time fell back with heavy loss be specially severe in last attempt a main body of volunteer have now come up entered by back of house joined defender fire of two hundred fifty musket played terrible havoc among assailant there be pause in fight now ship broadside continued to sweep native town with ball while occasional spurt of musketry fire broke out when black showed in of street suddenly from score of house in native town smoke followed speedily by flame mounted up scoundrel have fired town exclaimed doyle who have now joined nat see have chance of crossing here a can not plunder place have made up mind to destroy yes be likely to succeed doctor wind be blowing way native house be roofed with palm leaf will burn like tinder only chance now be to drive black out altogether then fight fire at once sent sailor down with flag to signal to ship to stop firing then went out into street a soon a be seen be joined by french lieutenant commander with several officer of volunteer together with monsieur pickard think gentleman nat said that unless take offensive drive black out of town there will be little hope of extinguishing fire wind be blowing strongly in direction there be not moment to be lost if be to save town negro must be thoroughly demoralized must have lost over thousand men here three four hundred before entered town be quite likely that have retreated already in case anticipate serious resistance others at once agreed drum be beaten volunteer soldier sailor poured out from house then dividing into three column advanced down street through black have retired met with resistance few negro who have entered house to gather plunder be shot down a issued out with exception none of enemy be seen until column issued from town when negro must be seen retreating at run across plain french officer at once ran forward with men to little battery sent shot after shot among for be still le than mile away sailor volunteer slung musket behind running back endeavoured to check course of flame however be impossible fire spread from house to house with extraordinary rapidity wind hurled burning flake on ahead dropping many upon inflammable roof in twenty minute whole quarter west of royal street be in flame be now joined by turnbull crew two negro who have be sent off to ship with boat alone remaining in charge of vessel have beaten negro turnbull fire will beat if wind continues will sweep whole town away be useless to try save of native house look at burning flake flying over head after short consultation with french officer agreed that only chance be to arrest fire at edge of european quarter that whole force must at once set to work to pull down native house adjoining sound of cannon on other side of town have continued until now gradually ceased a news reached negro there that main attack of whose success have felt sure have hopelessly failed be not long before troop from battery came up to assist worker labour however be in vain shout of dismay called attention of men who half blinded with dust smoke be working utmost looking round saw that flame be mounting up from several of house behind wood work be everywhere a dry a tinder burning flake be falling thickly upon have set house on fire in dozen place can hing more sir officer in command of troop said business part of town be doomed that must even hope to save be detached house standing in garden shrubbery so turned out flame swept onward until business quarter a well a native town be completely burnt out needed effort of soldier inhabitant to prevent private residence of merchant planter from being ignited by burning fragment scattered far wide by wind be noon when officer crew of agile accompanied by m pickard who be like rest blackened by dust smoke returned on board well have be a hot morning work a ever went through turnbull said be hard to believe that battle have be fought town destroyed in course of about five hour yes think on whole may be very well satisfied turnbull though suppose people who have lost house store will hardly see in same light still saved life at rate monsieur pickard can be congratulated on having got good on board just in time be thankful indeed that be so planter said hope of course to get something for estate a to house after what have seen here can not set much value on have happened morning may happen at cape francois to morrow might not be able to take dozen negro choosing time when strong wind be blowing starting fire in a many place might level town to ground at rate will direct captain of brig to sail at once for kingston to deliver cargo to agent there will proceed to cape francois wish to learn whether bank there have sent off fund security to safer place be retaining in latter case will withdraw at once will put up estate for sale will give passage monsieur pickard have nothing more to stay here for will sail up coast to morrow morning thank very much accept offer with gladness be anxious to close connection with unfortunate island a soon a possible in afternoon governor of town with officer commanding troop maire deputation of leading citizen came off to thank nat for assistance that crew gun have rendered brought with official document rehearsing service saying that have not be for assistance have rendered town must undoubtedly have be captured by black probably white on shore massacred together with wife family who have taken refuge on board shipping commandant stated that document must be sent to british admiral at kingston nat replied very modestly saying that officer men on board have rejoiced at being able to render service in cause of humanity that be only acting in accordance with order have received from admiral to afford aid in power to white population of island after official visit many of merchant planter military officer came off individually to thank for having saved wife family by protection that have afforded to shipping by aid given by gun landing party have alone saved town from capture at daybreak next morning agile got up anchor started for north brig containing monsieur pickard property have sailed previous afternoon rest of shipping be preparing to start at time agile got up anchor of be crowded with fugitive woman child being now joined by many of male relative who have lost almost possessed by destruction of home warehouse next morning brigantine arrived at cape francois news brought of destruction of port au prince caused great excitement a be felt that fate have befallen one town might well happen to monsieur pickard at once went to bank where found that greater portion of specie valuable document have already be sent for safety to jamaica received order upon bank there for payment to of money have placed on deposit in bank of various security document have be held in safe keeping for then went to pay visit to monsieur duchesne to whose house nat who have landed with have gone direct family be delighted to see may expect visitor shortly said monsieur pickard have come on shore with have gone to bank now said that must come on here later then have escaped madame duchesne exclaimed have hardly even hoped that family have done so for knew that black have risen everywhere in part of island yes be happy to say that madame pickard two daughter got safely away in fact came off to craft not agile know to arrow have pleasure of taking a passenger to jamaica where lady still be be good news indeed myra said valerie be great friend of mine of course louise be younger be very fond of too year before last spent couple of month with at plantation a daresay told be always here for three four month in winter season nat then told what have taken place at port au prince how men have taken part in fight be terrible news indeed said m duchesne one can scarcely feel safe here port au prince be largest town in hayti with exception only of be quite a open to danger of fire think will decide on leaving matter seem going from bad to worse know whether know that three commissioner have arrived from france so far from improving state of thing be making worse day a far a can be seen be occupied solely in filling own pocket have enormously increased taxation at time when everyone be on verge of ruin account be given of sum collect certainly money have not be spent in taking measure for safety of town for suppression of insurrection have wound up affair here have disposed of plantation there be many who still believe that in time everything will come right again have hope even if got peaceful possession of estate there must be hand to work freedom of black have be voted by mad assembly in paris if there be one thing more certain than be that negro will not work until be obliged to so estate will be practically worthless therefore have accepted offer for sum be about quarter of what estate be worth before consider that be so much saved out of fire monsieur pickard be of exactly same opinion a be nat said have come here principally for purpose of disposing of estate on term that can obtain well think will find difficulty in getting about same proportion of value a have done rich mulatto be buying freely a say of white be doing same ah here be ah dear pickard be glad indeed to see to learn from friend here that wife daughter be safe in jamaica have be very anxious about madame duchesne said myra have be constantly talking of family be same with can assure be strange that must first have obtained tidings of safety from monsieur glover that must also have obtained news of ours from still more so that while have a said to be of little service to learnt from one of officer seems to have be considerable be to that also owe life little service madame duchesne repeated indignantly however know monsieur glover of old first of saved myra life from dog certainly saved life from negro did save have just told that came on board with that took to jamaica still be not like what did for be one way of putting madame monsieur pickard said with smile a say know of old will not be surprised at little story have to tell not now monsieur pickard nat said hastily if do will say good bye to madame duchesne at once go straight on board must not do madame duchesne said a rose to foot have only just arrived be not going to let off so easily will compromise husband said now monsieur glover know that wife daughter will be dying of curiosity until hear story suppose take turn down town with will go enquire whether there be ship likely to sail in course of few day so for jamaica then monsieur pickard can tell story wife can retail to later on see monsieur pickard wife daughter be great friend of ours madame myra naturally wish to hear what have happened to during terrible time very well nat said with laugh mind accepting that compromise really do hate hearing thing talked over be just ordinary affair remember that monsieur pickard naturally will make great deal more of than be worth since doubt outcome of be that family did get out of hand of black in consequence now monsieur duchesne will start with at once so madame myra curiosity may be satisfied a soon a possible monsieur duchesne took nat first to call upon three commissioner who happened to be gathered in council commandant at port au prince have asked to convey report have hastily drawn up of attack on town have sent ashore a soon a anchored commissioner be discussing news when nat monsieur duchesne be shown in thought gentleman nat said that might perhaps like to ask question upon point be not explained in commandant report be a told drawn up in great haste for with four fifth of town laid in ash population homeless unprovided with food hand be full indeed thank lieutenant glover report doe full justice to interposition in favour indeed state that have not be for assistance rendered by ship of war command town must unquestionably have be carried by insurgent that whole of white including troop must probably have be massacred have be done must undoubtedly have so greatly encouraged rioter that must hardly have hoped to maintain hold even of city be only carrying out order received in landing to protect white inhabitant from massacre gentleman in opinion be anyone to blame for course event took even have that opinion nat said must certainly not consider justified in criticising action of officer authority of foreign power however circle of town be too large to be defended by force available of whom half be volunteer ready to fight most gallantly a can testify not possessing discipline of trained troop think however that even have battery be erected round town insurgent must have be prevented from effecting entrance at point setting fire to house advanced with great determination in spite of destructive grape fire maintained by three gun of battery undoubtedly have battery be placed together on side a on one at be thought probable that attack must be made insurgent might have be repulsed must have needed much larger force than in town to man battery think be by mean improbable that even in case town might have be burnt for there be still large number of negro employed on wharf in warehouse may take a certain that of be in close communication with insurgent probably agreed to fire town must friend fail to effect entrance can only say sir that citizen enrolled for defence fought most gallantly a did small party of soldier manning battery on side that when fighting be over laboured nobly to check progress of flame several question be put to concerning detail of fighting measure have be taken for safety of woman child part own men played manner in insurgent after gaining footing in town have be prevented from obtaining entire possession of at conclusion of interview have lasted for upwards of two hour commissioner thanked nat very cordially see monsieur duchesne said when left governor house asked single question a to whether thought there be danger of similar catastrophe taking place here yes noticed did not if have must have told very plainly that although negro suffered very heavily yet news that second town in hayti have be almost destroyed must be sure to raise hope consider extremely probable that day other town will also be attacked time must be lost in putting into state of thorough defence ca say that impressed at favourably short a be time that have be here have managed to excite party against have issued amnesty pardoning even who have committed most frightful atrocity upon have infuriated portion of mulatto by announcing repeal of decree in favour without shadow of legal authority have extorted large sum of money from mulatto who have remained quiet be resident here seem bent upon extracting remains of late fortune from white one of be frequently drunk lead scandalous life appears bent solely upon enriching third seems to be well meaning man be wholly under control of drunken companion if be sort of aid be to receive from france future be hopeless indeed indeed small portion of friend begin to see that unless england take possession of island future be altogether hopeless general opinion here be that be impossible that peace can much longer be maintained between england france hope that one of first step england will take after war be declared will be to land army here if english government be persuaded that mulatto negro a well a white be favourable must think that island might be annexed without difficulty unless party be agreed can not think that force must be spared must even hope for success must have be easy task before mulatto slave learned own strength be very different thing now must say that must need at least five twenty thousand men perhaps even twice that number to reduce island to submission to restore peace order can not think that engaged in war with france england must be able to spare anything like force for difficult almost certainly long series of operation here by time have arrived at monsieur duchesne house friend have only just finished story madame duchesne said a entered what story what frightful suffering what horror added with smile though eye be full of tear what 'little service rendered by brave crew have told of fight afterwards with terrible pirate how have added to list of have saved from terrible death eighteen twenty spanish gentleman lady twice a many sailor yes have have wonderful luck nat said see have be well rewarded be only just out of time a midshipman be in command of fine ship in ordinary course of thing must not have hoped for for

sir that have sent twelve men down that have done so lest must meet other party of people who might not know of safe conduct that have given handed document to nat have done well nat said know that

very close here be best that must be well among before be daylight might be noticed by someone in town must not concern much with dress that of sailor must be sure to cause talk excite suspicion among soldier went up to negro standing short distance away gave order at once started took place by nat sailor followed close behind talk french very well nat said yes sir thanks to toussaint remember though must know be daylight for have seen several time when have be over at plantation with mademoiselle duchesne be chief helper in monsieur bayou stable of evening toussaint have sort of school four five of always went to learned to read write to talk french a white talk not a do be good man love there be many who think will one day be king of island know much more than of others may be that will be killed before for biassou hate because doe not like cruel way speaks boldly against one else dare even francois whom regard a equal in rank to there have be many quarrel biassou know well enough that if be to hurt toussaint there must be general outcry that men who carried out order must assuredly be killed for one doubt that must get toussaint removed quietly if there be chance of doing so mean to give chance there be twenty of who keep guard over a for toussaint be not like others who when there be nothing else to be done spend time in feasting drinking be always busy attending to wounded who be brought up to sick of whom there be many for cold air in mountain have brought down great number with fever especially whose plantation lay on plain who be accustomed to sleep in hut very many have died toussaint have saved many be needed must have two hundred for guard instead of twenty indeed think not of danger whole thought be taken up with work be often without regular sleep for night together so great be need for service ground at once began to rise rapidly before day fairly broke be high among hill when became light nat examined document toussaint have sent to ran a follows toussaint do give notice to have given safe conduct solemn promise for safety to monsieur glover british officer with whom desire to converse on matter of importance then followed signature great seal in red wax be one monsieur bayou used negro said toussaint brought wax from office us often so that may recognize when see for a know sir there be scarcely of people who can read after three hour walking man pointed out wood near crest of high hill mile distant toussaint be there said accompanied to point in order that must have le distance to travel nat be by mean sorry at news way have be very steep difficult sun have now gained great power a neared edge of wood toussaint came out to meet be glad to see monsieur glover said quietly learned from people at cape francois that have returned there with madame duchesne daughter rejoiced indeed at escape seemed to marvellous for how avoided search made for must not tell told that madame duchesne be carried down on litter must have greatly added to difficulty hardly thought monsieur when saw last that must thus meet again a one of leader of people a commander of english ship thing change quickly toussaint negro led way to rough hut constructed of bough tree in centre of clump must need breakfast a see be ready for men will be cared for breakfast be rough nat enjoyed greatly toussaint remarked that have breakfasted hour before talked while guest ate be a well said that must be down near spot where landed before be dark for track be far too rough to travel after dark suppose have ordered boat to come to fetch yes ordered to be there a soon a must leave ship without being seen from shore hardly thought must be able to return evening a messenger told that camp be six hour journey among hill yes camp be there too must like to return before there be many who need care have already be too long away now monsieur glover a to subject on asked to come to converse with have heard that of planter have sent deputation to jamaica asking governor to send troop to take island for england a doubtless know be not for republic call royal army seeing that national assembly of france refuse to do anything for be true that commissioner at cape francois have issued proclamation offering free pardon to who have be concerned in insurrection freedom equal right to men of colour believe assembly care nothing for passed decree giving right to mulatto in way affecting then directly found that mulatto be exercising right passed decree reversing first one can not expect good faith in men like must wait till have laid down arm returned to plantation then must shoot down like dog just a be murdering best men of own country keeping king prisoner therefore recognize republic be for king fear there will soon be king for to recognize nat said everything point to fact that be determined to murder a have murdered noble good man in country see that toussaint said gravely number of who know what be passing in france be small however who do know be responsible for mass who trust in must consider what be best thing to do do think there will be war between france england think that if king be murdered indignation in england be already intense will be so great that war be certain so much better for toussaint said more fight against other le will be able to pay attention to hayti on other hand more likely will be that english will endeavour to obtain possession of island now between french english have great choice regard a french speak french language have ever since colony be first formed lived under french flag then on other hand french have be master be determined that will never again be so now a to people in own island have slave just a french have here have intention of changing slavery under one set of master for slavery under now sir do think that if english be to come here must guarantee that slavery must never exist again in island can not say nat said can not answer for what british parliament must do in matter feeling against slavery be growing very fast in england feel convinced that before long law will be passed putting stop altogether to transportation of negro from africa whether feeling will at rate for long time so gain in strength a to cause parliament to pas law abolishing slavery altogether in british dominion be more than can say must be tremendous step to take must mean absolute ruin to island for know a well a do that people be not disposed for work must never make steady labourer if allowed to live in own way then see be slavery abolished altogether in island must be difficult in extreme to continue in others must not find a slave here toussaint said must find free people without master unattached to plantation to regular toil must be like carib in jamaica must be a if came to land foreigner have never visited must find people with arm in hand perfectly capable of defending ready to accept sovereignty of england on condition that personal liberty be in way interfered with there be great deal in what say toussaint to morrow will sail for jamaica explain exactly line take to admiral may say that in coming to see do so in accordance with order received to ascertain if possible view of leader of movement if term be refused toussaint went on people invade island will leave french to fight out until perceive be stronger a soon a do so will aid weaker say that will stand aloof up to time will fight against must be equally enemy if one be so far getting better of a to be likely to drive other out then in self defence must unite force against may say that although mulatto be fighting against french alliance be not likely to be long one know that if got upper hand must be far more cruel more tyrannous than white have be have ever looked down upon have treated with far greater contempt than have white who to do justice be kindly master especially treated house servant well there will therefore be four party here hostile to other french will be striving for mastery for liberty mulatto for domination of island for personal interest way have pointed out be in opinion only one can bring about peace if government people will give solemn undertaking that in case will slavery ever be re established that men will have equal right will join heart soul when say equal right mean that will have vote be at present absolutely unfit to have vote to exercise political power only mean that law will be same for a for white that will be taxed on same scale in proportion to mean that assembly will have power to make separate law concerning must attempt to make such law must be at once dissolved by white authority of island think proposal perfectly fair one toussaint have doubt that one who have a have knowledge of situation here must not hesitate to accept doubt whether public opinion at home be ripe for change must be denounced by having interest in west indian island declared by to be absolutely destructive to prosperity however may be assured that will represent offer in most favourable light must ask however be empowered by other leader to make have talked matter with francois who be wholly of opinion toussaint said be useless to talk to biassou when be not murdering someone be drinking opposition must go for little except among very worst of people be already regarded with horror disgust may be assured that career will ere long come to end in case francois will share power between at same time blind to possibility that other leader may arise men of one district know little of others may elect own chief still think that if have authority to say that proposal have made to have be accepted must count on support of great majority of men of colour for already be beginning to find that life of lawless liberty have drawback already have be obliged to order that certain amount of work will be done by man among plantation beyond reach of town in order to ensure supply of food order have be obeyed not very willingly for there can be doubt that portion of men believed that when have once got rid of master there must be occasion whatever for further work that must somehow be supplied with abundance of that required sickness have prevailed have also have effect there be few indeed here who have knowledge of medicine poor people have suffered accordingly when in plantation be always well tended in sickness while here have have shelter care be very well to tell that liberty can not be obtained without sacrifice that must be long time before thing settle down man find work to do poor people ignorant a be be like child think very little of future effect of century of slavery will take many year to remedy for although believe that will finally obtain what desire will become undisputed master of island foresee that trouble be only beginning have have training for self government will have destroyed civilization reigned here will have nothing to take place dread that instead of progressing may retrograde until sink back into condition in lived in africa at moment negro ran up doctor said there be large number of people close at hand think can make out biassou among fear that may have trouble monsieur glover toussaint said quietly be assured with will maintain safe conduct with life biassou must have arrived at camp after left must have heard there be going to meet english officer have followed be present when francois arranged to send messenger to propose meeting to then assented a often a not forgets in morning what have agreed to overnight went apart spoke to men twenty of have accompanied from camp with twelve who have formed escort nat sailor there be in thirty eight from quiet way in took up arm nat have little doubt that must if necessary make stout fight against biassou savage arrived in two three minute have evidently travelled at top of speed for breath came fast be bathed in sweat aspect be savage in extreme most of wore garment other spoil of murdered victim of broad panama hat others have woman shawl wrapped round waist a sash have jacket be once white others be naked to waist few have gun rest ax pike carried long knife conspicuous among be biassou negro of almost gigantic stature immense strength to owed small part of supremacy among friend came on shouting treachery treachery word be re echoed in hoarse chorus by follower who numbered about hundred fifty at threatening aspect of new comer toussaint men closed up round signed to stand back quietly awaited coming of biassou calmness of toussaint have effect on biassou instead of rushing at with axe a have seemed be intention paused again shouted treachery what nonsense be talking biassou toussaint said be carrying out arrangement to francois agreed other night be having interview with british officer when did agree to thing great negro roared last friday night agreed that be well that must learn intention of english that must ascertain position in must stand be to come here remember nothing about toussaint be possible enough latter replied know that be uncommon thing for to forget in morning what be arranged overnight officer have come here on invitation under safe conduct man will touch while live be agreed biassou said have sworn to that white who fall into hand will be spared such be case be not said to follower answered with loud shout began to press forward men have not fallen into hand toussaint said have come here on invitation a have told with safeguard be very well for to talk toussaint know pretend to be with heart be with white be here to conspire with against raised axe a if about to rush forward be madness biassou toussaint said sternly have not enough enemy now that must quarrel among have done enough harm to cause already by horrible cruelty for coloured man who fall into hand of white have to suffer severely beware how commence conflict may be more numerous than be be better armed even if overpowered in end must suffer heavily before did so wish harm toussaint for last time demand that white men will be given up to for last time refuse toussaint said men without order moved up close to biassou stood for moment irresolute then with shout to men to follow sprang forward in instant nat threw before toussaint when biassou be within couple of yard of threw up arm levelled pistol between negro eye drop axe shouted be dead man negro stood like black statue for instant pistol be foot from face knew that before uplifted axe must fall must be dead man drop nat repeated if before count three fire one two negro axe fell to ground stand where be nat exclaimed slightest movement fire come up here men four sailor came up cutlas in one hand pistol in other man be prisoner said keep between one on side other two behind if make slightest movement to escape if black behind approach nearer send four bullet into brain men took up station a directed now biassou went on lowering own pistol can continue conference with toussaint illustration drop nat repeated see biassou toussaint said have only rendered ridiculous repeat what said before officer be here in answer to invitation sent to after francois have agreed that be advantageous to learn what object of english be if question will find that be a say have have conference have expressed view will repeat what have said to british governor of jamaica think that result may be be well that english must understand that have resolved that whether french be possessor of island slavery be abolished for ever here will return at once to coast will then sail direct for jamaica now if have observation to make will be glad to hear doubt what say biassou replied sullenly must be settled by what francois say when rejoin so be toussaint said now pray let there be quarrel between have be forced to withstand because be bound by sacred promise division will be fatal to cause for moment may be in superior force time who love follow might be more numerous well know be a faithful to cause a be must set example to follower that while may differ a to method by success be to be gained be at one in main object admit be wrong great negro said frankly drank more than be good for before started blood have be heated by speed with followed be sober now for have to thank added with grim smile young officer though own that like method let think more of held out hand to toussaint latter took shout of satisfaction rose from negro on side determined attitude of toussaint men fact that have four white among that almost of have musket have cooled courage of biassou follower who a soon a leader be captured saw even if gained victory must be at cost of at least number there be prospect of plunder of advantage knew that beloved respected a toussaint be be very possible that who did survive fight must fall victim to indignation must be aroused at news of attack being made upon now that be settled may a well be starting for coast toussaint nat said there be nothing more for to arrange a presence here might possibly lead to further trouble sooner be off better will not ask to stay negro said think that will have more trouble there be saying several of biassou men have wine skin with quarrel might arise when have drunk more will send down under same escort a before think that will need so many must not like to weaken so far there be fear for toussaint said decidedly arriving in hot blood might have attacked be sure will not do so now know well enough must be terribly avenged be to do so be quite necessary that must take a many men a before for be possible that of biassou men might steal away follow few minute afterwards nat set out with men guard of twelve black be still hour before time at be to be met by boat therefore halted when within mile of shore there waited until be dark then went on alone with four sailor to beach in few minute after arrived there heard sound of oar of gig be heartily glad to see back again turnbull said a nat stepped on to deck lippincott have be horribly uneasy about day did everything go off quietly yes except for two three minute when bloodthirsty scoundrel biassou came upon scene with hundred fifty of follower there be very nearly shindy then passed off for did not like looking down muzzle of pistol at few inch from head four men made prisoner until affair have taken friendly turn be not long after for when leader of party be prisoner guard have order to shoot instantly if there be trouble be astonishing how quick people be in coming to understanding yes must say so turnbull laughed however a have turned out well have fulfilled mission doe matter to hope that have now done with creeping alongshore work chapter xvii french frigate on arriving at kingston nat went on board flag ship reported to admiral particular of visit to toussaint be evidently long headed fellow admiral said from point of view proposal be fair one be afraid people at home must never give such undertaking must be impossible for to have one island where black be free while in others must remain slave must be a much a saying to 'if want freedom must fight for ' even if people at home must bring to pay immense amount of money must be required to emancipate slave by indemnifying owner must nevertheless be ruin of island connected with however will take ashore to governor after clerk have made copy of report have made two copy sir better then will go at once governor heard story received report be at least satisfactory said to have learnt from one of what view of principal leader be consider that have performed commission exceedingly well lieutenant glover undoubtedly at great deal of risk to a to matter of communication will of course receive serious attention be far too important business for anyone to give off hand opinion upon fancy sir that be likely to have more active work before long for think there be doubt that war will very shortly be declared with france privateer will be swarming about sea be nearly six month before special incident took place vessel have be missing since capture of agile be evident that pirate there might have be among island have moved to water where must carry on trade with le interruption agile cruised about among island although have pleasant time officer men alike grew impatient at uneventful nature of work thing be little changed in hayti biassou have be deprived of command be surmised that have be murdered at rate be never heard of again francois toussaint commanded former came to be so jealous of toussaint popularity that latter be obliged to retire to cross frontier into spanish part of island there be well received showed great ability in various action against french with whom spain be then at war many other negro have declared for spain upon singular ground that have always be governed by king preferred to be ruled by king of spain rather than by republic with only six hundred men toussaint drove fifteen hundred french out of strong post occupied in spanish town of raphaelita afterwards took several other post village be for success that gained name of l'ouverture opener marquis d'hermona gave rank of lieutenant general three french commissioner have returned to france have be succeeded by two others santhonax poveren former ruffian of same type a who be deluging soil of france with best blood who made odious to party by brutality greed at last at end of february came news of execution of king of france certainty that war be imminent now will have more lively time turnbull said have be dull enough of late there have be nothing to grumble at surgeon said what must have have be sailing about like gentleman with nothing to do to drink sleep look at island take thing easy altogether talk doyle turnbull said laughing there be one who have grumbled more than be in cause of science irishman retorted how can ever become distinguished man show what be in make sort of discovery if there be never chance come in way there be instrument ready for use might a well be at bottom of sea hone once week well nigh shed tear because of good work ought to be doing be very well for turnbull wo forget how to kill man when time come let tell that fellow who doe know b c can kill man whereas take man of science to cure there be good deal in doyle nat said when laugh have subsided though know that considered in light before that perhaps be because have tried one never tried other be fine thing doyle said to be surgeon there see man with leg shot off if be not for must die take in hand amputate bit higher up make tidy comfortable there be walking about almost a well a if have two leg although be not fit for ship service again must be a good man in fight with cudgel a ever be now ask fairly what be there that can do to compare with nothing in way must admit nat laughed well may be having opportunity of showing superiority before long be just ground french privateer be likely to choose there be plenty of french port for to put into hundred of bay where must lie hidden lot of shipping to plunder doubt will be thick in channel down strait merchantman will not think of going there unless in large fleet under convoy of ship of war while here though might be guarded on way across atlantic must have to scatter a soon a be among island well must look out that be not caught napping of course until get news that war be declared ca fire upon frenchman while if one arrived with news before got might sail up close by pour in broadside at rate be likely to take prize lippincott said for instant get news can pounce upon french merchantman yes homeward bound must hardly hear news a soon a do while of coming out many slow sailers will have left before war be declared may not be here for week after hear of great thing will be for to put on main line of traffic a have received special order can cruise where like must say that coming from france must be likely to keep down coast of spain on to madeira before strike across a in way must be altogether out of line of gulf stream then if be making for hayti must probably be coming along west on about th parallel north while if making for guadeloupe martinique must be three four degree farther south probably privateer must follow same line a before commencing operation must want to take in provision water to learn where cruiser be likely to be to pick up pilot so on so must say that can cruise about water for fortnight safely then go through caribbean island cruise seventy eighty mile beyond carefully avoiding putting into of own island a pas why must do turnbull asked because chance be that must find at barbados st lucia dominica in fact at of other island one of frigate at rate officer senior to in case a have fixed order from admiral might be detained sent off in direction might not suit at good doyle said be always safe rule to keep out of way of bigger man than have always observed that captain of man of war of frigate be sure to be down on small craft if get chance be like big boy at school fagging little one must do quite a well without be just matter of devilment to show authority heaven protect against falling in with frigate if be frenchman must sink if be britisher must bully reached ground on nat have decided to cruise three day later look out at mast head shouted sail ho word acting like electric shock to on deck how doe bear about east by north sir there be three vessel can only see topsail at present two of be bit bigger than third look to to be merchantman must say other by cut of sail be frenchman low cheer broke from men now if fellow brings news that war be declared be in luck nat said be convoying two french merchantman have overtaken have two british prize have picked up if be english will not get so much prize money then will have le difficulty with privateer if privateer be because must have put good many of hand board prize so can in case count upon doing well at rate be not likely to suspect that be english being french built french rigged even if have doubt will be satisfied a soon a see name on bow will not get up more sail will go up have look at turnbull said slinging glass over shoulder went aloft think called down after long look at that middle ship be good deal larger than look others be carrying stitch of canvas have royal topgallant sail yard have wide spread be inclined to think that be frigate large corvette certainly french one a to others can not say with certainty rather fancy be english in case have captured on way being much faster than be have to go under easy sail to keep with well hope be not too big for nat said a turnbull rejoined what must call too big sir turnbull asked with smile well must say that fifty be too big must think so indeed twenty gun sloop must be pretty formidable opponent yes twenty must about suit especially a may have fifty of men on board other craft be if be prize be men be more afraid of than gun two to one be great odds in gun especially a generally work ours faster than french do when come to hundred fifty men so against forty may be very unpleasant if get spar knocked away come alongside of may a well get french flag up at once with good glass must make out long way off let men have breakfast be bad thing to fight fasting men be not long over meal by time came on deck again stranger be within five six mile wind be in north east agile be almost close hauled while others have wind broad on quarter there be now no longer doubt that outside vessel be two large british west indiaman fact that be in company with what be undoubtedly french frigate be regarded a absolute proof war have be declared that french ship of war on way out to colony with news have overtaken captured two british ship be probably sailing in company a approached agile be luffed up more into wind in order to pas between frenchman prize within few cable length to starboard of how many gun do make out to be mr lippincott think that have eighteen gun on broadside odds be pretty strongly against nat said will have weather gauge count for good deal anyhow will be able to annoy possibly if hang on to sound of firing will bring up one of cruiser from barbuda antigua awning be stretched over quarter deck have not be taken down a brigantine approached french frigate there be sign that intention be not of peaceable nature french ensign floated from peak sailor on deck be lounging about with jacket on others in shirt only few with hat on seemed to be watching with idle curiosity approaching vessel nat officer retained uniform for a only head shoulder showed over rail there be nothing to distinguish from of fine french privateer for generally adopted regular naval dress two vessel be fifty yard apart a met nat sprang on to rail in reply to hail from frenchman what ship be that raised cap in salute shouted agile of bordeaux have news from france sir yes war have be declared with england illustration nat sprang on to rail thank be good news indeed leapt down on to deck vessel be travelling at speed of about eight knot hour be already passing one fast when a nat waved hand french flag be run down english ensign already fastened to halyard be simultaneously run up moment later five gun have previously be trained to bear aft double shotted poured broadside into quarter of french frigate shout of surprise fury rose from thought that little craft so fearlessly approaching be enemy have crossed mind of on board still le that if british must venture to fire upon so vastly superior foe about ship nat said instant gun have be fired sail trimmer be at place agile shot up into wind head paid off swept round on other tack crossing stern of frenchman gun on starboard side sending shot in through stern window raking whole length a be brought to bear then wore round on heel gun on larboard side be reloaded again raked frenchman so far not single shot have be fired in return din on board frigate be prodigious a gun have to be cast loose magazine opened powder shot carried up sail trimmed to enable to bear up so a to show broadside to puny foe before must do so agile true to name be again round frenchman confused by variety of order issued be slow at work a opponent came up into wind brigantine be again astern of raked time with heavy charge of grape chorus of shriek cry from frigate told how terrible be effect by st patrick surgeon exclaimed to lippincott be grand look a if captain be going to give chance instrument laid out ready for action never mind doctor will be able to practise on frenchman lippincott laughed french captain knew business putting helm over again ran off wind so that two vessel be now on same tack with agile on opponent quarter several of french gun be now brought to bear discharge be too hurried owing to brigantine lying so much lower in water shot flew between mast made hole in mainsail in moment be round again crossed opponent stern at distance of thirty yard word being passed along that gunner be to aim at rudder post to double gun loud cheer rose a two of shot struck mark frenchman replied with volley of musketry from marine gathered on poop three of sailor fell several others be hit frenchman be when agile delivered last broadside running nearly before wind be speedily evident that injury to rudder have be fatal for although attempted by trimming sail again to bear up time fell off though not before of shot have hulled active opponent seeing however that must now be easily outmanoeuvred frenchman made further effort to change course continued doggedly on way topmen swarming aloft shaking out more canvas agile followed frigate example placing on stern quarter kept up steady fire yawing when necessary to bring gun to bear french replying occasionally with one of stern gun owing to accelerated speed at vessel be now going indiaman have be left behind hour later frigate mizzen mast have be severely wounded by first broadside went over side cheer after cheer rose from agile opponent be now at mercy have to repeat tactic with have begun fight just a nat gave order to do so musket shot be heard in distance crew of one of merchantman have be allowed to remain on deck a being under gun of frigate there be possibility of attempting to overpower captor a soon however a became evident that frigate be getting worst of have be hurried below hatch dropped over from port hole however must obtain view of what be going on ahead of a soon a saw frigate mast go by board armed with anything must serve a weapon managed to push up after hatch rushed on deck prize crew be clustered forward watching fight shout from helmsman apprised of danger rushed aft be however le numerous than british sailor better armed for believing that frigate must easily crush tiny assailant be unprepared to take part in fight contest be very short one knowing that frigate be crippled that brigantine must soon be free to return to frenchman saw that must eventually be taken officer in command being knocked senseless with belaying pin threw down knife surrendered other indiaman at once put down helm on seeing that british flag be being run up on consort must not let that fellow get away nat said can leave frigate alone for hour will give two more broadside with grape through stern window then bear up after lumbering merchantman will be alongside in hour in le than time be within pistol shot of west indiaman prize crew at once hauled down flag agile went alongside released prisoner who have be securely fastened in hold replaced by french crew indiaman officer have be allowed to remain on deck now captain nat said to english master please keep sail full follow will not

circulated men hastened into boat with alacrity with went surgeon assistant to see if must be of help on board while captain first lieutenant nat went into cabin latter related detail of action skilfully managed indeed mr glover captain said when have finished one must have done better be fortunate indeed that little craft be so fast handy for if frigate have brought gun to bear fully upon ought to have be able to fairly blow out of water with single broadside may ask if be first action sir be in tender of orpheus frigate when captured very strong pirate hold near port of barcela in caracas destroying place capturing blowing up three of ship remember affair captain said very gallant one be for if be right frigate must not get into entrance landed men captured two of pirate battery turned gun on ship while schooner have captured few day before sailed right in engaged be nearly destroyed when one of pirate blew up officer in command of be killed midshipman be very highly spoken of for succeeded to command gallantly went on board pirate drowned magazine much more be said about than necessary nat said captain looked surprised by way lieutenant broke in remember name now be mr glover mentioned in despatch yes sir a said captain be good enough to make more of affair than deserved expect that be best judge of that captain said well after after sir have command of little four gun schooner be cruising along coast of hayti to pick up fugitive when came across brigantine now command in act of plundering merchantman have just captured left prize followed be faster more weatherly than be having have luck to smash jaw of gaff after running fight of seven eight mile be able to get back to prize recapture before pirate came up crew of prize came up manned gun between engaged brigantine carried by boarding on taking into kingston admiral gave command raised crew from twenty to forty have now be cruising for four five month not until sighted frigate prize have have luck to fall in with enemy well sir captain said even admitting that have have luck there be question that have utilized opportunity have extraordinary record if get shot prophesy that will be admiral before many officer old enough to be father now be sure must be anxious to get on board prize a soon a possible so will take to at once in few minute be on deck of spartane be scene of extraordinary activity lower mast have already be parbuckled on to deck where sheer leg have be erected by party mast be soon in place wedge driven in shroud have be shortened men be engaged in tightening lanyard

go ashore with to governor ought to pay respect to fortunately will not require assistance from for unless be greatly mistaken job will be finished evening mast rigging will certainly be fixed before dusk carpenter must stick to job till be done like make shift will not be so good a original think will serve turn for there be little likelihood of bad weather at time of year suppose intend to keep merchant seaman on board if not will spare hand be much obliged sir think will do very well be fine reaching wind will scarcely have to handle sail between jamaica very well understand feeling must like to finish business without help be very natural must do same in place how about merchantman paper sir will tell governor have ordered to be taken to kingston where there be regular prize court therefore will not be necessary to trouble with manifest here then if have permission captain will row off to at once tell to get under sail now will overhaul long before get to jamaica mount between six twenty gun keeping together french privateer if have arrived must venture to attack especially a can not have received news yet war be declared think must be very good plan captain said for if be to start with be clear that must only be able to go under sail be evident by account that be faster than frigate with reaching wind suppose there be not more than knot between if wind freshens must find hard to keep up with visit be paid governor agreed that must be better that indiaman must sail at once indeed have already started be two three mile away before nat captain arrived at governor house when on shore nat ordered two three barrel of rum to be sent off in boat to frigate on arrival allowance be served out to worker before save that mizzen mast be twenty foot lower than usual that stern quarter be patched in numerous place with tarred canvas spartane presented former appearance when majority of crew have finished work prisoner be transferred to isi two hour later carpenter boatswain party have securely fixed temporary rudder at daybreak next morning two frigate brigantine started on westward voyage chapter xviii engagement three vessel kept company until on third day after sailing overtook two merchantman nat supposing that isi must now leave went on board to thank captain for great assistance that have given will stay with now mr glover news of outbreak of war will be known at jamaica by time for despatch be sent off on day before sailed from home by fleetwing be fastest corvette in service be to touch at antigua then go straight on to port royal be to carry news to barbados so that doe not make difference whether reach kingston two hour earlier later there be possibility that french may have sent ship off even before declared war with a be certain that there be several war ship of out here one of might fall in with before reach jamaica therefore a order be simply to report to admiral at kingston think be quite in accordance with duty must continue to sail in company with thank sir there certainly be at least one french frigate in bay of hayti if have received news be quite likely to endeavour to pick up prize before be generally known just a spartane picked up merchantman though possibly might beat off must very much prefer to be let alone yes have done enough for one trip must much regret be to be deprived of of capture agile be signalled to prepare to pick up boat nat be soon on board own craft again ran up to within speaking distance of spartane shouted to turnbull that isi be going to remain in company with turnbull waved hand for although have not entertained fear of being attacked felt nervous at responsibility if sudden gale must spring up temporary rudder be carried away be comfort to to know must happen isi must doubtless take in tow for in anything like wind agile must be of little use however weather continued fine in five day after leaving barbados entered kingston harbour three hour before isi have spread sail entered dropping anchor hour before agile sailed in in charge of three large ship brigantine be heartily cheered by crew of vessel in port be naturally supposed that be isi have done principal work in capturing spartane captain however have rowed to flag ship directly came in port leaving mr ferguson to see to spartane being anchored have given brief account of nature of procession be approaching three four mile away be most extraordinary young officer admiral said first distinguished nearly three year ago by rescuing daughter of planter in hayti who be attacked by fierce hound who must have be killed have not run up be very seriously hurt managed to despatch animal with dirk since time have be constantly engaged in different adventure be in desperate fight when orpheus broke up notorious horde of pirate on mainland distinguished greatly be up country in hayti when negro rose there saved from black lady daughter same girl that have rescued from dog shot eight of villain have one of rib broken by ball in spite of that carried lady who be ill with fever thirty mile across rough country down to cape francois in litter then gave command of little cockle shell of schooner mounting four gun carrying only twenty men hearing of planter family in hand of black landed whole of crew while expecting to be attacked by boat rescued planter three lady six white men got down on board although opposed by three hundred negro then captured brigantine now command valuable prize that have taken say have now captured french thirty six gun frigate after fight in lost in killed wounded half crew recovered two indiaman have picked up on way out went out on quarter deck where admiral repeated to officer story that have just heard from soon circulated round ship of crew have just cleaned gun with have returned salute fired by isi a entered port on arriving for first time on station be scarcely surprised when a brigantine approached first lieutenant gave order for ten more blank cartridge to be brought up for crew to prepare to man yard surprise of on board other ship of war merchantman be great when saw sailor swarming up ratline running out on yard be unusual thing admiral remarked to captain of isi own ship possibly contrary to rule of service think occasion excuse brigantine did not salute a came into port a be considered to be on station what can be doing on board flag ship nat said to lippincott think be going to man yard be not king birthday anything of sort know of a be just eight bell must be something of kind a came nearly abreast of flag ship signal well done agile be run up at same moment there be burst of white smoke thundering report tremendous cheer rose from seaman on yard be saluting sir lippincott exclaimed ensign have be dipped in salute to flag salute have be acknowledged by admiral five minute before lippincott now sprang to stern again lowered ensign admiral officer be on quarter deck a raised cocked hat others stood bareheaded nat uncovered be so moved that have difficulty in keeping back tear felt deep relief when last gun have fired cheer given by own handful of men by on board prize have ceased for next quarter of hour be occupied in seeing that four vessel be anchored in safe berth then a signal for to go on board flag ship be hoisted reluctantly took place in gig went to make report admiral saw by pale face that be completely unnerved at once took into cabin see mr glover began kindly that must much rather that did not say anything to at present welcome have be given to speaks more than word must do of appreciation of gallant feat say that have taken first prize since war be declared for be probable that other capture have be made nearer home at rate be first have be made in water be surprised indeed when captain talbot told that have hundred french prisoner on board fifty wounded a have not mark of shot either in sail in hull must not understand until gave outline of what have taken place of how have become possessed of be prize much injured have good many shot hole on quarter sir stern light fitting be knocked away suffered very serious damage requires new mizzen mast there be not hole in canvas be new for fired only at stern be just below deck that mast be damaged have hope written full report of engagement nat handed in report be very short merely stating that having fallen in with thirty six gun french frigate spartane convoying two prize have engaged after placing on quarter have raked until mizzen mast fell rudder be smashed that seeing that must not get away have then returned to prize turned out to be jane of liverpool of eight hundred ton burden flora of london of nine hundred thirty crew of latter on seeing that spartane be crippled have risen overpowered prize crew other struck colour when came up to then returned to spartane struck flag without further resistance desire to bring to notice great assistance received from lieutenant turnbull whom afterwards placed in charge of prize from mr lippincott be also duty to mention assistant surgeon doyle have be indefatigable in attention to own wounded of spartane then followed list of own casualty of spartane very official report mr glover admiral said with smile when have glanced through however admiralty will wish to know detail of action of so exceptional character must therefore ask to send in a complete account of affair a possible both for own information theirs now think have better take glass of wine can see that really need one will have to receive congratulation of officer by way do know anything of cargo of two ship retook sir have really not have time to enquire till left barbados be constantly employed on way out have kept close to spartane in order to be able to assist at once if anything went wrong with steering gear must wish to say sir that feel under deepest obligation to captain talbot for great assistance that crew have rendered in getting up jury mast fitting up temporary rudder have not be for might have be detained for time at barbados having drunk glass of wine nat went out with admiral on to quarter deck officer pressed round shook hand congratulated did not last long for admiral said kindly sound of cannon gentleman have have much greater effect upon mr glover nerve than have of prize think must let off without further congratulation for to day besides have long report to write for good many other thing to see to nat be glad indeed to take place in gig to return to agile spent two hour in writing report in duplicate when have done went ashore to prize agent to enquire what formality be needed with regard to recaptured merchantman having signed official paper went up to monsieur duchesne monsieur pickard family have sailed month before for england duchesnes be still in possession of house have hired enjoyed said so much feeling of rest security that be by mean anxious for sea voyage indeed madame duchesne be still far from well husband be reluctant to take to cold climate of england until summer have well set in ah dear nat madame duchesne said be hoping that must be able to spare time to call to day husband must have gone off to see knew that have great deal to do town be talking of capture of french frigate recapture of two prize that have taken several of friend have come in to tell about of course be not surprised for capturing frigate with agile be more wonderful than taking agile with arrow be lucky affair altogether madame duchesne knew that must say so myra said indignantly do always say be luck a if luck must do everything have patience with will endeavour not to use word again in presence myra nat laughed have time for argument to day have only just run in for flying visit to see how be have end of thing to see to suppose will be day before business of prize be finished frigate formally handed over value of indiaman cargo estimated however a soon a be at free will come in for long talk know that there be nowhere feel so happy at home a do here be indeed three day before have time to pay visit be too bad of not coming to dinner myra said a entered really did expect hoped must be able to get here in time ever since saw have be going backwards forward between ship shore calling at dockyard prize court to day there have be regular survey of spartane be so long over began to think must not be able to get away at will be becoming quite millionaire monsieur duchesne said if go on like well see be lucky beg pardon myra mean be fortunate have very small crew on board arrow a be independent command whole of prize money for capture of agile prize be divided among with exception of flag share found to surprise that share came to l without knowing anything of cargo of prize have recaptured now what will be paid for spartane must think that share must come to twice a much time so will be able before long to retire into private life be if have inclination to do so suppose madame duchesne said that if marry will want to settle down be too young to think of matter madame nat laughed why be only just nineteen will be quite soon enough to think of in eight ten year there be doubt that when time come will give up sea think be fair to wife to leave at home while be running risk of being shot be bad enough for in time of peace in war time must be terrible for strike that war be likely to be long one seems to that be question for man to ask whether love profession woman better if care more for sea must remain single if think more of woman let settle down with sound very wise monsieur duchesne said with smile when time come for choice fancy that most men accept either alternative marry still go to sea be all right when have only profession to depend upon nat said then if woman with eye open to fact that must be away from for month be ready to take man for better for worse suppose temptation be too strong to be withstood happily wo be put in way for even if never take ship will have enough to live on quietly ashore now must tell story of fight myra said story be told in twenty word replied did not suspect that be enemy until have passed broadside told what be a agile be faster much more handy than frigate managed to keep astern of sailing backwards forward poured broadside in stern while must scarce get gun to bear on managed to cripple rudder after fight be virtually over however kept flag flying till shot away mizzen after seeing that be at mercy that captain two lieutenant more than half crew be killed wounded lowered colour now really be whole account of fight if be telling sailor who must understand nautical term must explain matter more clearly if be to talk for hour must understand more about than do now hour later nat went out with monsieur duchesne to smoke cigar on verandah myra remaining indoors with mother who be afraid of sitting out in cool evening breeze going back to conversation about marriage nat monsieur duchesne said be question wife feel little interest in see be now more than three year since saved be life after rendered wife inestimable service now know that in country marriage be for most part arranged between young people with arrangement must be considered indecent if father mother be out here usual course must be for mother to approach wife talk matter over with wife must consult with finally when old people have quite come to understanding father must speak to on subject be impossible here now seems to wife that having rendered such inestimable service to having be thrown with daughter good deal who may say without undue vanity be very attractive young lady must scarcely be indifferent to a said according to british notion be too young to think of marrying at rate wife have sounded myra girl have assured that have never said word to must lead to believe entertained other than what may call brotherly affection for now can tell frankly that one of reason for remaining here for past six month have be that desired that matter must be arranged one way other have struck that be not youth only that prevented from coming to asking for myra hand foolish idea that be a be undoubtedly case very rich heiress before go farther may ask if be case if really entertain such affection for daughter a must putting aside question of money of youth lead to ask hand can answer at once sir ever since first met especially since saw how bravely supported that terrible time when might fall into hand of black have thought of daughter a most charming girl have ever met of course be lad young girl thought of marriage at time even entered mind during past three year that feeling have grown until have found that happiness depends entirely upon felt monsieur that lip be sealed not only by fact that be heiress only penniless lieutenant because must be most unfair ungenerous be on strength of service may have rendered to ask for hand be not on account of service much a recognize offer hand because mother feel that happiness be great object of life be involved in matter in most case young lady well brought up doe not give heart until father present to eligible suitor be exceptional case do think that girl whose life have be saved a hers be at risk of of rescuer who during most terrible time came to look up to a protector of herself mother who moreover be constantly hearing of daring action to whom dearest friend also owed life must not make hero need not say that subject have not be mooted to be because desired matter to be settled before left for europe that have lingered here be glad indeed that now know feeling in matter be conscious that in giving to be securing happiness have of course ever since day when saved from dog watched character very closely result have be in respect satisfactory now will go in tell will take place by mother side that may a well come out here keep company in minute myra stepped out on to verandah be cool nice here nat think must do mother more good out here than keeping in house where in first place be hot while in second place give horror to see way moth thing fly into light burn to death doubt be pleasanter here nat said wondering how ought to begin be very soberly said nat myra laughed one must think that be proposition required good deal of consideration be proposition received consideration in point of fact just at present dear head be little turned with conversation have just have with father what do mean asked mean that see before great unlooked for happiness happiness have hardly ventured even to hope for at present be incomplete be for to crown if can do so father have given consent to telling that love do love truly earnestly myra must not be content with anything le than love want to be gratitude want thought of business with dog of other business with black to have anything to do with must have something to do with said softly for be owing to that first began to love be at first doubt girl love for one who have done so much for since then have become woman love for one man that must choose out of love nat love with heart ten minute later went hand in hand into house monsieur duchesne have told wife what have occurred in verandah a came in rose threw arm round myra neck kissed tenderly have chosen wisely child have made very happy can give to monsieur glover without one misgiving know that in hand life will be happy one now went on with smile will have to face terrible problem be discussing hour since will have to choose between wife sea problem may be settled at once madame nat said with smile at rate there be occasion to choose at present madame duchesne went on myra be just past sixteen father think that be a well that must wait at least couple of year before there be talk of marriage for sake yours after brilliant service especially in capturing frigate be sure of rapid promotion must be pity indeed for to give up profession until have obtained rank of captain when must honourably retire will leave for england very shortly france be out of question a said daughter be young can well afford to wait be so madame quite acquiesce in decision a to going to england be likely may be going there very shortly admiral hinted to day that a dockyard people say that spartane can be ready for sea in ten day so will probably send home in very kindly kept back report of action merely stated that french frigate spartane have be brought in in tow by majesty brigantine agile together with two merchantman have captured on way out have also be retaken by agile said that thought be only fair must carry back own report full despatch on subject of course may be sent out again may be employed on other service at rate will be able to get short leave before go to sea again have be out here now six year feel entitled to little rest must certainly rather be employed in mediterranean than here for there be more chance of seeing real service next day nat received order from admiral to hand over command of agile to lieutenant turnbull lippincott who must pas examination receive step be to act a first lieutenant midshipman from one of ship on station be to be second officer nat be ordered to superintend repair fitting out for sea of spartane be awfully sorry that be going glover turnbull said of course be great pull for being appointed to command be very jolly happy a be think there ever be pleasanter party on board one of majesty ship however of course be great lift for will try to keep thing going a comfortably a did have doubt that will do turnbull have able ally in doyle doyle be inconsolable when came on board yesterday told that be going home in spartane be to have command be worst news have heard for many day doyle have said be very well turnbull have sort of complaint to make of be afraid that luck will go with glover be luck not ship whatever have put hand to have turned out well say that have not done work a well a must be done there be doubt that luck be everything if one of agile gun have knocked away mast spar from arrow must have be up with again have shot from frigate crippled must have be after taking agile into french port instead of bringing in here yes then see that upon occasion put craft where be difficult to get gun to bear on yes yes know that doe not alter bit if there have be only one shot fired have be unlucky boat must sure enough have brought one of spar about ear well doyle may be that be luck not glover pulled through see must have be shot have throat cut by pirate if have be taken by so possibly be good genius of boat may be lippincott botheration to irishman said a saw by twinkle in turnbull eye that be really chaffing there be one thing certain if get wounded fall into hand will not regard that a matter of luck well at rate doctor glover told hour ago of piece of luck in none of here can share be engaged to very pretty french girl whom be always calling on when be in port thought be what must come of turnbull lippincott said must be rum if have fallen in love with after that did for be greatly taken with doctor said first time came on board saw with eye that race be lost before have time to enter besides must not afford to marry without money one of poor devil of planter who have have to run away from hayti with for most part just clothes stood up in must hardly make father in law yours faithfully must desire wonder how manage to keep up such fine establishment here suppose have little put away in old stocking be just running through be shiftless people be planter having be always used to luxury know value of money turnbull burst into fit of laughter in lippincott joined for in early day of cruise on arrow have heard from nat how friend have for generation laid by portion of revenue allowed interest to accumulate so now that time have come for utilizing reserve be really much richer people than have be when living on fine plantation doyle looked astonished at laughter dear doyle turnbull went on be too comical to hear talking of shiftless planter belonging a do to most happy go lucky race on face of earth now will ask did ever hear of family of irish squire who for generation put aside tenth part of income allowed interest to accumulate without touching so that when bad time came found that be twice a well off a be before begorra be right turnbull never did hear of such thing believe ever happened since first irish crossed sea from somewhere in east well at rate doyle be what duchesnes have done must think from what glover say though did not mention precise sum for did not know must say that must come to at least hundred thousand pound mother of moses doctor exclaimed be mighty bad turn have done turnbull that never gave a much a hint of before must have be sorry for glover who be in way good fellow still must have deemed duty to family who once a know be case of almost other family in ould country be king of ireland must have restored ancient grandeur of family built grand castle kept open house to comer to think that never knew then think doctor lippincott said with laugh that only have to enter list to cut glover out go quite so far a of course now thing be settled for good must be of use trying to disturb must hardly be fair on glover see a long a be open matter might have well tried luck must have have great advantage see be grown man whereas glover be still lad then though say must talk head off be a good a who have kissed blarney stone at bewildering dear creature be great advantage doubt doyle see glover have one advantage have doubt counted with lady more than have enumerated have saved life at risk of own have carried mother through terrible danger yes yes there be something in doyle said shaking head if poor young fellow be satisfied with gratitude have nothing more to say at rate have lost chance now perhaps a know about might put up to other lady in similar circumstance with heart free to bestow upon deserving man must not be justified in doing so doyle after what have be saying about building baronial castle keeping open house be clear that must soon bring fortune to end however great might be therefore must not feel justified in aiding in way in matrimonial adventure be poor heart never rejoices doctor said tumbler be empty sam rascal bring bottle of old jamaica fresh lime cold water be one of drawback of bastely climate that there be pleasure in taking punch hot one of negro brought in material now doctor turnbull said know that in spite of terrible disappointment will drink heartily toast glover mademoiselle duchesne may live long happily together be good doyle said a emptied tumbler at draught nothing short of bumper must do justice to hand bottle again lippincott cut couple of slice off lime yes will take two piece of sugar please turnbull now be going to propose toast new commander of agile may in hand do a well a did in of nat glover three day later agile started on cruise nat spent time in dockyard where be so well known to official that did everything in power to aid to push matter forward week after brigantine have left spartane be ready for sea nat have seen admiral several time have heard nothing from a to who be officer who be to take spartane home whether be to sail a passenger bearing despatch a one of officer when went on board flag ship to report that be ready for sea admiral said mr winton first lieutenant of onyx be invalided home be good officer climate have never agreed with a father have lately died have come into property will have doubt go on half pay for time until be thoroughly set up again will therefore appoint a first lieutenant of spartane mr plumber second lieutenant of tiger will go second have decided mr glover to give rank of acting commander captured ship be fair that must take to england mind think probable enough that authority at home may not be willing to confirm rank a be little over two year since obtained present grade feel that be incurring certain responsibility in giving command of thirty six gun frigate have have opportunity of showing that be thorough seaman can fight a well a sail ship be immensely obliged sir nat said hesitatingly have never for moment thought of doe seem tremendous responsibility besides will be over two officer many year senior to have spoken to of admiral said pointed out to that after have captured frigate with little brigantine commanded considered almost right to take home put frankly to that if have objection to serving under one so much junior must by mean press point that at same time must naturally prefer having two experienced officer with instead of officering entirely with young lieutenant junior to yourself be glad to say that of agreed heartily admitted very great claim that have to command mr winton be anxious to get home know that might have to wait time before ship of war be going mr plumber be equally anxious for short run home for a frankly stated to have for three year past be engaged to be married have ground for hope that may get appointed to ship on home station so a gentleman be perfectly willing to serve under there need be difficulty on part in matter will therefore consider a settled have made out appointment a acting commander sincerely hope that will be confirmed in rank at rate will count for good deal that must have acted in capacity here be instruction will be short handed can not spare enough men from ship on station to make up full complement hundred fifty be that can possibly let have have told master of two indiaman that will have to furnish contingent have be on board ship to day addressed crew said that be going to take home spartane be short of hand said that did not wish to press men against will hoped that five twenty from ship must come forward voluntarily that number have aided to bring spartane in here knew might be sure that ship must be comfortable one told must give pass saying that have voluntarily shipped for voyage home on guaranteeing that must if chose be discharged from service on arrival more than number required volunteered at once asked captain to pick out for men who have before be on board spartane of whose conduct have spoken highly three merchantman will sail under convoy nat went ashore after leaving admiral naturally went straight to duchesnes who do suppose be going to command spartane asked a went in know who ought to command took ought to command well seems absurd be just what be going to do myra clapped hand in delight have made real captain then said with laugh will be acting commander give one honorary rank of captain may be long time before get appointed to rank admiral have be awfully kind people at home be not likely to regard age appearance a in way suitable for position be happy to say nat that will sail under convoy have be settling affair making arrangement for leaving have morning definitely taken cabin in myrtle a furniture be not ours have not accumulated many belonging knowing that might be sailing at moment can get everything packed by to night go on board to morrow morning captain must not tell at what hour must sail said that must depend upon frigate must like to start at eight if must can not say whether everything will be quite ready however have better be on board at hour will be jolly indeed having so close to will be able to see other sometimes myra asked many time hope of course must depend partly on weather if be becalmed at time might come on board spend whole day if be bowling along rapidly must scarcely be thing to stop two ship in order that passenger might go visiting be twelve o'clock on following day when spartane fired gun at signal anchor have be hove short be run up sail shaken out spartane three vessel under charge started on voyage chapter xix home voyage home be pleasant not exciting one suspicious sail be sighted until neared mouth of channel then two three craft bore appearance of french privateer have at different time approached only to draw off a soon a made out line of port of spartane there have be sufficient day of calm light wind to enable duchesnes to frequently spend few hour on board frigate nat have felt little uncomfortable at first be not long before became accustomed to position of course must not be on same familiar term with officer a have be on board agile insisted upon first second lieutenant dining with regularly will really be kind of if will said for will feel like fish out of water sitting here in solitary state a have drawn something on account of prize money kept excellent table two officer willingly agreed to suggestion have always thought mr winton said that there be good deal more stiffness than be at necessary even desirable on board ship of war be not so in army dined several time at regimental mess at kingston although colonel be of course treated with certain respect conversation be a general a unrestrained a if have be private gentleman yet of course on parade ground colonel be a supreme a captain on quarter deck at sea captain really never get to know anything about officer except with regard to duty on board ship think be good either for officer in general that must be cut off from a much a if be emperor of china agree with so far mr winton said do think rein of discipline be held too tautly that where captain be really good fellow life on board might be much more pleasant than now be with bad tempered overbearing sort of man suggestion must act just other way well must easily put stop to nat said if admiralty must refuse to appoint bad tempered overbearing men to command other laughed must help out of difficulty certainly think that change have better be deferred until perceive a junior officer in service perceives that such men be curse to everyone else that be hated by whole crew from ship boy to first lieutenant that ship with contented cheerful crew can be trusted at time to do duty against odds sailing south of isle of wight spartane came in through nab channel there left convoy who anchored on mother bank while sailed into portsmouth harbour with white ensign flying over tricolour a entered be greeted with loud cheer by crew of ship of war a soon a have picked up mooring nat landed at dockyard proceeding to admiral reported there admiral be away inspecting fort in needle passage young officer said captain painton might be able to give information that require only want formally to report before taking post chaise to london perhaps have better see other said little puzzled a to who young officer must be who be in charge of despatch think have what name will say glover flag captain be short square built man with keen eye not unpleasant expression bluff hasty in manner now mr glover what can do for asked shortly well sir hardly know course of procedure a want to start with despatch for london in quarter of hour will be glad to be able to hand over ship command if can not be taken over in summary way to know whether first officer be to retain charge of until can return from town what be vessel that have honour to command sir captain painton said with slight smile spartane frigate prize mounting thirty six gun entered harbour quarter of hour ago captain have idea that be ill timed joke on part of young lieutenant do wish to understand sir said sternly that be in command of prize that certainly sir be what wish to understand have brought home from jamaica have honour to hold appointment of acting commander there see be official despatch of be bearer addressed to admiralty with word charge of acting commander glover officer sir suppressing with difficulty explosion of wrath at what considered fresh sign that service be going to dog first officer be lieutenant winton second lieutenant plumber very well sir will go off at once will detain no longer nat at once hurried off while captain painton went into office of of official of dockyard service be going to dog said here be young lieutenant who from appearance ca have passed more than year pitchforked over head of heaven know how many senior placed a acting commander of thirtysix gun frigate french prize sir just look up record of lieutenant under one be lieutenant of fifteen year service other of twelve be monstrous scandalous sort of thing be destructive of discipline prof that everything be to go by favouritism just at outbreak of war be enough to throw cold water on spirit of who be hoping to distinguish ignorant of storm have be excited in mind of flag captain nat be already on way having a soon a landed sent coxswain to order post chaise to be got ready for starting in quarter of hour be eight o'clock when dropped anchor by nine be on road by handsomely tipping post boy drew up at admiralty at past four what name will say sir doorkeeper asked acting commander glover with despatch from jamaica admiral looked up with amazement a nat be announced latter have not mounted second epaulette to a commander be entitled admiral on first glance thought that attendant must have made mistake did understand sir that be commander acting one only sir have come home in command of spartane prize mounting thirty six gun admiral be good enough to appoint to acting rank in order might bring home with despatch report respecting capture by brigantine agile of ten gun have honour to command yes saw very brief notice of capture in gazette ten day ago particular be given suppose mail be just coming out when arrived be partly reason doubt sir think admiral must have written more have not in kindness of heart left to to hand in full report may say have good fortune to recapture two valuable west indiaman that spartane have picked up on way out admiral rose from table took down thick volume from book case at back be word record of service be partly printed wide space being left under name for further record to be written in glover nathaniel be that christian name captain glover nat bowed exceptionally good record 'distinguished greatly in attack by frigate orpheus on three piratical craft protected by strong battery passed a lieutenant shortly afterwards appointed to command of schooner arrow four gun charged to rescue white inhabitant off hayti if possible to enter into communication with negro leader learn view in course of performance of duty landed with crew of twenty men took off french planter family eight other white in hand of force estimated at three hundred fifty black fought way on board ship again later on engaged pirate brigantine agile of ten gun have just captured spanish merchantman after sharp fight took possession of prize with aid of crew capture agile now with agile have taken spartane thirty six gun frigate to say nothing of recapturing two valuable west indiaman prize of hers suppose commander glover if confirm in rank command will go forth appear next time with french three decker in tow from tiny schooner to frigate be greater distance than from frigate to line of battle ship yes sir nat said with smile advantage of quick manoeuvring one get in small craft give one chance against larger adversary becomes lost when be frigate against line of battle ship spartane be fairly handy must not hope to gain much advantage way over bigger vessel wonder admiral have men enough to spare to send home must hardly have done so sir fifty of merchant sailor belonging to recaptured prize volunteered for voyage be furnished by admiral with discharge on arrival at portsmouth very good plan for be hard work to get men now that be fitting out ship at naval port now commander glover will detain no longer will carefully read through despatch evening will discus with colleague to morrow will be glad if will dine with to morrow evening at half past six here be card address beg pardon sir be altogether ignorant of such matter must come in uniform plain clothes must suit best admiral replied with smile a have only just arrived to day from west indie doubtless have have little time for preparation before sailed be more than likely that may not have have time to provide with full dress uniform have not sir indeed have have time must not have thought of buying one of acting rank must naturally terminate a soon a object for be granted be attained very well then come in plain dress may tell for information that when invited by admiral to official residence must be expected to appear in uniform when asked to dine at private residence must not be considered a naval function although at say that must be wrong to appear in uniform there must be necessity for doing so a everyone dressed for dinner in west indie for sake of coolness comfort nat be well provided in way after dinner at golden cross went to playhouse have posted letter to father be written before landed directly reached town saying that be home that of course must not say how long must be before must be able to leave ship a soon a did so must run down into somersetshire stay there until received order to join vessel to return to west indie next afternoon paper came out with official news news boy be shouting hoarse capture of french frigate by ten gun british brig thirty six gun against ten three hundred fifty frenchman against fifty englishman nearly monsieur killed wounded rest taken prisoner glorious victory nat be greatly amused a looked out of window of hotel at eager hustling be going on to obtain one of broadsheet sound big thing said to there be nothing in whole thing be over in le time than take to talk about well hope will get off to portsmouth again to morrow go down to dear old pater wish dinner be over doubt there will be more of old admiral there will be wanting to learn in out just a if twenty word must not tell how be thrashed so easily know well enough that if have quick handy craft get under weather quarter of slow moving frigate latter have shadow of chance although not official dinner twelve gentleman who sat down be with exception of nat connected with admiralty first lord several other admiral be there others be head of department post captain before begin dinner first lord said have pleasure in handing to commander glover there be one opinion among colleague be that a have captured spartane have come home a commander can not do le than confirm in rank leave in charge be certainly unusually young for such promotion career have be for past four year so exceptional that seem to have scarcely option in matter such promotion be not only reward have gallantly won that must receive will feel animate other young officer to wholesome emulation will be advantageous to to service in general nat must scarcely credit ear that might be appointed second lieutenant of spartane other ship of war be thought probable acme of hope be that first lieutenancy in smart sloop might possibly be offered to two officer on way home have talked matter over with have be little amused at seeing that never appeared to think within bound of possibility that rank must be confirmed although a admiral before sailing told have most strongly recommended that must be done thought certain that authority at home must see matter in same light have asked not to give slightest hint to nat such promotion might be awarded to never can tell admiral said what admiralty will do here be chance that often get of making really popular promotion without suspicion of favouritism being entertained beyond fact that have be mentioned in despatch doubt if anyone at whitehall a much a know young fellow name service generally will see that for once merit have be recognized on part of one who so far a patronage go be friendless nat returned to portsmouth following morning spent hour in signing paper going through other formality spartane will be paid off to morrow captain glover port admiral said will be recommissioned immediately hope will be able to get of men to re enter for there be good deal of difficulty about crew so great number of ship have be fitted out during past four five month that have pretty well exhausted seafaring population here even press gang fail to bring many in going on board nat sent for boatswain gunner informed that a be to recommission spartane be anxious to get a many of hand to reship a possible have doubt that of will join sir quarter master said talking among saying that have be a pleasant ship a have ever sailed in if be to hoist pennant good many of must sign on must not mind giving couple of pound head think that must be of use sir if men will join will join if wo wo besides have got pay most of prize money coming to must be only so much more to chuck away if have thing sir think when men like officer like to show that be so must rather reship without bounty to show that liked than have supposed that be for sake of money after men have be paid off next morning told in short speech that have be appointed to recommission spartane said that must be glad to have good many of with again be much gratified when fully two third of men including greater part of merchantman stepped forward entered name that speaks well indeed for young commander port admiral who have be present said to flag captain be seldom indeed that find anything like so large proportion of men ready to reship at once prof that have confidence in skill a well a in courage that feel that ship will be comfortable one be expected that spartane must be at least month in hand of shipwright men on signing be given leave of absence for time a soon a be arranged nat took post chaise drove to southampton there found duchesnes at hotel ship have gone into
