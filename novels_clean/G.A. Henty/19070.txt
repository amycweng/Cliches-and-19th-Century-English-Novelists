leading to wood have be used in construction very beam be of rough stone floor be of same material be clearly object of builder to erect fortress must defy fire must only be destroyed at cost of enormous labour be indeed prime necessity for hold stood in wild country between upper water of coquet reed river harbottle longpikes rose few mile away whole country be broken up by deep ravine valley fell crag from edge of moorland hundred yard from outer wall ground dropped sharply down into valley where two village of yardhope lay on little burn running into coquet in other direction moor extended for distance of nearly mile on two three score of cattle dozen shaggy little horse be engaged in effort to keep life together upon rough herbage grew among heather block of stone scattered everywhere presently lad caught sight of flash of sun have just risen behind on spearhead at western edge of moor ran down at once from post to principal room be coming mother exclaimed have just seen sun glint on spearhead trust that be there said then turned to two woman by fire bade put on more wood get pot boiling go up again oswald a soon a can make out father figure bring down news have not

gray following forster of currick john liddel percy hope of bilderton must have full sixty spear bairds be like to pay heavily for last raid hither dame forster did not reply oswald ran up again to lookout by time party for whom be watching have reached moor consisted of twelve fourteen horseman clad in dark armour carrying very long spear mounted on small wiry horse be driving before knot of forty fifty cattle three of led horse carrying heavy burden oswald quick eye noticed that four of horseman be not carrying spear be three short of number said to four must be sorely wounded well might have be worse oswald have be brought up to regard foray attack a ordinary incident of life watch ward be always kept in little fortalice especially when night be dark misty for there be never saying when party of scottish borderer might make attack for truce so often concluded between border warden have slight effect on pricker a small chieftain on side be called who maintained constant state of warfare against other scotch foray be more frequent than from english side of border not because people be more warlike because be poorer depended more entirely upon plunder for subsistence there be little difference of race between people on opposite side of border be largely of mixed danish anglo saxon blood for when conqueror carried fire sword through northumbria great number of inhabitant moved north settled in district beyond reach of norman arm on english side of border population be in time leavened by norman blood a estate be granted by william to baron often married heiress of dispossessed family while follower found wife among native population frequent war with scot in man capable of bearing arm in northern county have to take part incessant border warfare maintained most martial spirit among population who considered retaliation for injury received to be natural lawful act be to extent heightened by fact that term of many of truce specifically permitted who have suffered loss on side to pursue plunderer across border raid be not accompanied by bloodshed except when resistance be made for between people descended a be from common stock there be active animosity at ordinary time there be free friendly intercourse between there be however many exception to rule that unresisting person be not injured between many family on opposite side of border there existed blood feud arising from fact that member of one other have be killed in foray in case bitter bloody reprisal be made on side very border line be ill defined people on one side frequently settled on other a be shown by fact that several of treaty contained provision that who have so moved might change nationality be accounted a scotch englishman a case might be between forsters bairds such feud have existed for three generation have begun in raid by latter forster of time have repulsed attack have with own hand killed one of bairds six month later be surprised killed on own hearthstone at time when son most of retainer be away on raid from time animosity between two family have be unceasing several life have be lost on side bairds with large party have three month before carried fire sword through district bordering on main road a far a elsdon on east alwinton on north news of coming have however preceded villager of yardhope have just time to take refuge at forster hold have repulsed determined attack made upon until sir robert umfraville brought strong party to assistance drove bairds back towards frontier present raid from party be returning have be organized partly to recoup who took part in for loss of cattle on occasion partly to take vengeance upon bairds a be custom on side of border expedition be generally composed of member of dozen family with follower one who be at once most energetic best acquainted with intricacy of country path across fell moor being chosen a leader presently oswald forster saw one of party wave hand at order four five of horseman rode out began to drive scattered cattle horse towards house oswald at once ran down father be right mother have just given order to men be driving animal in so suppose that bairds must be in pursuit have better tell men to get on armour without waiting for answer told six men who be eating breakfast at farther end of room to make end of meal get on steel cap breast back piece take place in turret over gate into yard in few minute animal began to pour in first of homestead then captured herd weary exhausted with long hurried journey then came master with follower mary forster son stood at top of step ready to greet gate into yard be on opposite side to of doorway of fortalice in order that assailant who have carried must have to pas round under fire of archer in turret before must attack building gave little cry a husband came up left arm be in sling helmet be cleft through bandage showed beneath be afraid wife said cheerily have have hotter work than expected so far a be concerned there be great harm done be sorry to say that have lost long hal rob finch smedley two three others be sorely wounded fancy few have got off altogether scatheless went well until stopped to wait for daybreak three mile from allan baird place shepherd must have got sight of a halted for found men up ready have not have time however to drive in cattle seeing that must like enough have bairds swarming down upon before must take allan place contented with gathering cattle driving off there be about two hundred of went fast in two hour saw bairds coming in pursuit a be clear that must overtake hampered a be with cattle stood made defence there be not much difference in number for bairds have not have time to gather in strength fight be stiff one on side percy hope be killed john liddel so sorely wounded that there be hope of life have sixteen men killed outright few of be more le scarred on side allan baird be killed john be smitten down how sorely wounded can not say for certain for put on horse took away at once left twenty behind on ground dead rest finding that be better men than rode off again william baird have not come up hold be too far for news to have reached a knew well enough doubtless came up with following few hour after have beaten kinsman have ridden too fast for to overtake struck off north a soon a crossed border travelled night by path by will find difficult to follow track especially a broke up into four party chose own way have driven cattle in in case must make straight here after losing track of course there be many who fought against who know well even be other than bairds have despoiled must hardly follow so far across border to fetch cattle a for bairds most notorious of scottish raider for to claim right of following must be beyond bearing why believe there be head of cattle among whole herd have not be born bred on side of border be who have be fetching back stolen good by time men have entered house who have gone through fray scatheless be assisted by woman removing armour from wounded comrade who have be forced to relinquish spear be first attended to there be thought of sending for leech man woman within fifty mile of border be accustomed to treatment of wound in hold be store of bandage styptic unguent ready for instant use most of men be very sorely wounded have be of le hardy frame le inured to hardship must not have supported long ride john forster before taking off own armour saw that wound be first attended to by wife woman think will do said that will live to strike blow at bairds yet now oswald unbuckle harness mother will bandage up arm head elspeth will bring up full tankard from below for of draught of beer will do a much good a salve medicament do take first drink jock samlen then go up to watchtower see men have be posted in wall turret one of will relieve shortly a soon a wound be dressed bowl of porridge be served round then one of men who have remained at home be posted at lookout after cattle have be seen to who have be on road stretched on rush at one end of room be in few minute sound asleep wonder whether will ever have peace in land oswald mother said with sigh a having seen that woman have in readiness for preparation of midday meal sat down on low stool by side see how ever can have mother until conquer scotland scotch will be master be not fault be ever raiding plundering heed not order of douglas other lord of march be almost a bad a be oswald nay mother do try to take back own a father well said cattle be brought in be english have be taken from by bairds do pay back in own coin make little difference whether be at war peace reiving caterans be ever on move be last week that adam gordon band wasted tynedale a far a bellingham carried off say two thousand head of cattle slew many of people if did not cross border sometimes give lesson must become so bold that there must be limit to raid be true enough oswald be hard that must always require to be on watch that one within forty mile of border can at time go to sleep with surety that will not ere morning hear raider knocking at gate methinks that must be dull be there nought to do to look after cattle oswald replied seemed to bred up a have be amid constant foray excitement that state of thing be normal one that be natural that man must need to have spear ever ready at hand to give take hard blow besides went on though carry off others cattle fetch home again be not bad friend while truce hold save in case of who have blood feud be last week allan armstrong two sister be staying here with promised that ere long must ride across border spend week with yes make worse adam armstrong married sister elizabeth whom first met at goddington fair indeed there be few family on side of border who have not english scotch blood in vein be natural must be friend seeing how often have held berwick roxburgh dumfries how often in time of peace scotchman come across border to trade at fair why must not be so when speak same tongue save for border line be one people though indeed be different in kirkcudbright wigtown where be galwegians tongue be scarce understood by border scot be strange that on one side of border on other can not keep peace towards other save when kingdom be at war mother do keep peace except in matter of cattle lifting bear enmity towards other save when blood be shed in wartime must of course fight for nation a lord order have wasted scotland again again from end to end have swept northern county well nigh a often have heard father say that eight time in last hundred year hold have be levelled to ground only escaped last time because built so strongly of stone that must not fire must have taken almost a long to pick to piece a took to build yes be when be infant oswald when heard scotch army be marching way took refuge with cattle horse among pike having first carried out burnt forage store leaving nothing that must set fire to father have often laughed at thought of how angry must have be when found that there be mischief that must do for short of long stay never make there be way in must damage be only house that escaped scot free for thirty mile round indeed 't be generally party of pillager who trouble part of country even when invade england there be richer booty by far to be gathered in cumberland durham for here have nought cattle horse of have a many on side of border be plunder of town chiefly attracts while go past here empty handed always carry great train of booty on backward way still must be dull work if there be fighting mother there be fighting in southern england oswald save for who go across sea to fight french yet suppose find life le dull than do have more to do here there be little tillage country be poor who must care to break up land to raise crop when night rick might be in flame granary plundered thus there be nought for to do to keep cattle need little care attention can be driven off to fell when scot make great raid in south a have heard there be always much for farmer to attend to who find life dull can always enter service of warlike lord follow across sea oswald shook head quiet pursuit of farmer seemed to to be poor substitute for excitement of border war may be a say mother for part must rather enter service of percy gain honour under banner than remain here day after day merely giving aid in driving cattle in out wondering when bairds be coming way again mother shook head father two brother have be slain last time scottish army have crossed border although naturally did not regard constant trouble in same light in southern woman must have viewed still longed for peace quiet be in constant fear that sooner later feud with bairds who be powerful family must cost husband life against open force have little fear hold must resist attack for day long ere yielded help must arrive although watch be vigilant precaution taken might be captured by sudden night attack william baird have knew great oath yardhope hold must one day be destroyed forsters wiped out root branch death of cousin allan in last raid must surely fan fire of hatred against one never can say what may happen said after pause if at time evil must befall escape remember that uncle alwyn be in percy service can not do better than go to place under protection act a may advise like not thought that must become man at arm yet methinks that be more dangerous than of householder on fell at least in strong castle man can sleep without fear whereas none can say a much here if aught must happen to father mother may be sure must share in bairds must spare one if captured hold although father will not a yet take with on foray must do share of fighting if hold be attacked be sure that must oswald be captured have doubt that a say must share fate speak not with thought that be likely thing will turn out a say may do so therefore give advice to seek out uncle a to capture of hold of have generally little fear fact that father have be wounded three of men killed that baird have fallen have brought possibility that may happen more closely to mind morning than usual now boy have best spend hour in cleaning up father armour arm steel cap must go to armourer at alwinton for repair can get of dint out of breast back piece can give fresh coat of black paint for borderer usually darkened armour so in raid presence must not be betrayed by glint of sun moon upon oswald at once took up armour went down step into courtyard so that sound of hammer must not disturb sleeper a with slight often repeated blow got out dent have be made in fray thought over what mother have be saying to also death of three of men who have for year be companion came a shock be seldom indeed that foray for cattle lifting have such serious consequence a rule be altogether bloodless be only because of long feud with bairds fact that warning of coming of party have in spite of precaution reached allan baird on present occasion such serious result have ensued have not be for cattle must have be driven off without resistance for allan baird own household must not have ventured to attack so strong party attempt must have be made to assault hold for have often heard father say even in case of blood feud held that house must not be attacked occupant slain if party met under arm matter be different that in spite of slaying of own father by must not kill even baird on hearthstone still baird have be killed assuredly william baird must not be deterred by similar scruple pitiless ferocity be notorious even own countryman cried out against of deed earl of douglas have several time threatened to hand over to english authority bairds be powerful must with ally place four five hundred men in field in difficult country in lived must have given great deal of trouble even to douglas therefore nothing have come of threat bairds have continued to be terror of part of english border be most convenient for operation oswald be now past sixteen promised to be a big man a father who be fine specimen of hardy northumbrian race tall strong sinewy have felt hurt when father have refused to allow to take part in foray time enough lad time enough have said when lad have made petition to do so be not strong enough yet to hold own against one of bairds moss trooper must come to fighting in couple of year will be time enough to think of going on excursion a be clever with arm will freely admit a ought to be seeing that practise for two hour day with men strength count a well a skill want when ride against bairds besides at present have still much to learn about path through fell across morass if be ever to become leader must know well enough to traverse on darkest night through thickest mist think do know most of father yes think do on side of border must learn on other side a well be indeed of even greater importance in case of pursuit for crossing border unobserved hitherto have forbidden to cross line in future mat wilson will go with know scotch pass defile better than in band so that go near bairds country can traverse safely so long a truce last for year indeed oswald on one of hardy little horse have ridden over country in company with one other of men have become familiar with morass moor fell pas down to old roman wall to south a far north a wooler being frequently absent for three four day at time have several time ridden into scotland to visit armstrong other friend of family have always travelled by road knew nothing of hill path on side life have in fact be far from dull for have many friend connection in village at foot of cheviot be frequently away from home journey be generally performed on horseback father encouraged to take long tramp on foot in order that might strengthen muscle must not infrequently give leave to pay visit on condition that travelled on foot instead of in saddle constant exercise in climbing riding with weapon at wrestling other sport including bow have hardened muscle of frame be capable of standing fatigue although father said that must not hold own against men knew that lad must do so against exceptionally powerful one believed that when time came must like be frequently chosen a leader in border foray must already draw strongest bow to arrowhead send shaft with strength must suffice to pierce light armour worn by scotch borderer be by bow that english gained majority of victory over northern neighbour who did not take to weapon be unable to stand for moment against english archer who not only loved a sport be compelled by many ordinance to practise with from childhood of other education have none in respect be worse off than majority of knight baron of time who be well content to trust to monkish scribe to draw up such document a be required to affix seal to have once six year before expressed wish to be sent for year to care of monk at rothbury whose superior be distant connection of father in order to be taught to read write john forster have scoffed at idea have to learn to be man lad have said monk will never teach that know one letter from did father of forebear be worse for on march unless man mean to become monk have to learn to make sword guard head to send arrow straight to mark to know foot of pass to be prepared at order of lord to defend country against scot be vastly more important matter than reading writing be so far a can see of use to fair man whose word be bond who deal with honest men can reckon up if sell so many cattle how much have to be paid more of learning than want not do hour spent on must be a good a wasted a to monk heaven forfend that must ever become one be good men doubt not suppose that be necessary that must take to that man who have full possession of limb must mew up for life between four wall passing time in vigil saying mass in reading book distributing alms seems to to be sort of madness certainly wish to become monk father thought must like to learn to read write when have learnt what then oswald book be expensive plaything scrap of writing have ever be inside wall of yardhope hold since be first built here a far a know a to writing must be of still le use if man have message to send can send by hired man if suit not to ride besides if have written person sent to must not be able to read must have to go to scribe for interpretation of content lad have plenty to learn before come to be man without bothering head with monkish stuff doubt if hotspur can do more than sign name to parchment what be good enough for percy be surely good enough for idea have in fact be put into oswald head by mother at time feud with bairds have burned very hotly must have lessened anxiety have boy be bestowed for time in convent oswald felt disappointment at father refusal to petition that must never have made have not mother dilated to on several occasion upon great advantage of learning thought of repeating request have ever entered mind father have thought more of have several time expressed grave regret to wife over such extraordinary wish having occurred to son boy have nothing of milksop about said be for age full of spirit courage how so strange idea must have occurred to be more than can imagine must a soon expect to see owlet in sparrow hawk nest a monk hatched in yardhope hold wife discreetly kept silence a to fact that have first put idea in boy head for although mary forster be mistress inside of hold in other matter john be masterful must brook meddling even by subject therefore of oswald learning to read write be never renewed chapter across border most vigilant watch be kept up for next week at yardhope hold at night three four of trooper be posted four five mile from hold on road by enemy be likely to come having under fleetest horse on moor when week passed there be slight relaxation in watch for be evident that bairds intended to bide time for stroke knowing well that must not be likely to be able to effect surprise at present outlying post be therefore no longer maintained dog of hold fully dozen in number be chained nightly in circle three four hundred yard outside barking must at once apprise watcher in turret on wall of approach of body of armed men two day later oswald started for promised visit to armstrong be not considered necessary that must be accompanied by of trooper for hiniltie lay few mile across frontier in high spirit galloped away riding through yardhope be soon at alwinton thence took track through kidland lee passed round head of usmay brook along foot of maiden cross hill crossed frontier at windy guile here stood on crest of cheviot descending passed along at foot of windburgh hill by noon entered tiny hamlet of hiniltie above perched on one of spur of hill stood armstrong hold be smaller than of yardhope have surrounding wall like be built for defence against sudden attack adam armstrong be on good term with neighbour across border although other member of family be frequently engaged in foray be seldom indeed that buckled on armour only when there be general call to arm be however on bad term with bairds partly because wife be sister of forster partly because of fray have arisen between herdsman of bairds for cattle wandered far wide on mountain slope to south sometimes passed ill defined line beyond bairds regarded country a own jedburgh be ten mile away hawick six seven stay after sun rose must speedily have brought strong body of men from town a well a from still nearer neighbour at chester abbotrule hobkirk oswald approach be seen two of cousin allan who be lad of about same age janet year younger ran out from house to meet have be expecting for last ten day former exclaimed have well nigh given up hold to be laggard girl added unless can duly excuse will have naught to say to excuse be good one janet father made foray fortnight since into bairds country to rescue of cattle have driven off from neighbour day before there be sharp fight allan baird be killed since then have be expecting return visit from have be sleeping with arm beside doubtless will come someday a be evident mean to come at present father let leave in case must forgive girl said rumour of fray have reached father shook head gravely when heard that baird have be killed by forsters be not only oswald replied there be of liddels hope other family engaged father be chosen a chief time be not quarrel theirs for have lost cattle father only joined because have aided last time must not hold back now of course be chosen a chief because know country so well well come in oswald be poor hospitality to keep talking here outside door boy have already taken charge of oswald horse after unstrapping valise have led to stable formed basement of house well laddie how fare with at home adam armstrong said heartily a mounted step to main entrance have heard of wild doings with bairds 't be pity that feud must go on from father to son ever getting more more bitter there can no more change borderer nature than can stop tide in solway hear that be well nigh pitched battle there be hard fighting oswald replied three of trooper eight ten of others be killed father be twice wounded one of hope be killed liddel severely wounded from what say bairds suffered more have not done so there must have be hot pursuit a far a know there be none bairds will bide time armstrong said gravely be dour men will take turn though wait ten year for at rate wo catch sleeping uncle come however strong may will find hard work to capture hold ay ay lad think will try to knock head against wall be more like to sweep down on sudden watchman will need keen eye to make out before be thundering at gate climbing up wall however father know danger be of use talking more of be done be done how be mother oswald mistress armstrong asked be well aunt bade give love to truly wonder keep health with trouble anxiety have hoped that after meeting last march of commissioner on side when lord of march plighted faith to other agreed to surrender prisoner without ransom to forgive offender must have have peace on border a know there be three exception named namely adam warden william baird adam french whom scotch commissioner bound to arrest to hand over to english commissioner to be tried a being notorious truce breaker doing infinite mischief to dweller on english side of border yet nothing have come of men still continue to make raid without check hindrance by earl of march douglas there be fault on side wife husband said deny gudeman have often heard say three men be pest of border be not for thing might go on reasonably enough for one count few head of cattle lifted now again be bad enough that two three year army must march across border one way other surely might live peaceably between time did not nearly lose at otterburn have laid up on hand for well nigh six month ay be sore day for side will tell about uncle oswald asked father care not much to talk of though know that fought there have never told story of battle be just going to sit down to dinner now adam armstrong said story be long one after have done will tell of father need not feel so sore about for since day of bruce have have a many victory to count a have after dinner however armstrong have to settle dispute between two of tenant a to grazing right be not until evening that told story in there be sort of trouble in england france naturally took advantage of recommenced hostility prepared to share in game word be sent round privately man be bidden to gather in jedburgh forest tell lad went with heavy heart for although men of name have reputation of being a quarrelsome fellow a dwell on border be exception love peace quiet moreover child be young saw that fight must be heavy business did not like leaving mother however there be help for gathered there over strong main body marched away into cumberland douglas march moray with spear footman including many armstrong entered northumberland marched without turning to right left staying to attack town castle house till crossed river tyne entered durham then began war burning ravaging slaying liked not for although when come to fighting be ready if need be to bear part care not to attack peaceful people be true that king have over over again laid waste half scotland killing slaying hanging doe not seem to satisfaction because twenty of ancestor have be murdered to slay twenty people who be not born until long afterwards whose forbear for aught know may have have hand in slaughter of mine however having laden ourselves with plunder from durham sat down for three day before newcastle where have sharp skirmish with sir henry brother sir ralph percy in one of captured sir henry pennant then marched away to otterburn after receiving warning from percy that intended to win pennant back again before left northumberland attacked otterburn castle failed to carry for be strong well defended there be council night most of leader be in favour of retiring at once to scotland with abundance of spoil that have gained douglas persuaded to remain two three day to capture castle not to go off a if afraid of percy threat so waited next day at night percy with spear infantry came up leader have not be idle for have examined ground carefully arranged how battle must be fought if be attacked having heard nothing of english day lay down to sleep not expecting to hear aught of until morning be moonlight night being in august there be short darkness between twilight english arriving at once made attack falling first on servant hut took for of chief gave time to form up in good order a have lain down in proper position portion of force went down to skirmish with english in front greater portion marched along mountain side fell suddenly upon english flank at first there be great confusion english being more numerous soon recovered order pushed back though not without much loss on side douglas shouted battle cry advanced banner fighting most bravely a did sir patrick hepburn for whose bravery douglas banner must have be taken for percy hearing cry of ' douglas douglas ' pressed to part of field bore backwards be in midst of with ten of kinsman though fought a became men be pressed back began to think that day must be lost then young earl furious at seeing disaster threaten dashed into midst of english rank swinging battle axe for time cutting way for one man strength courage can go for little in such fray of knight squire have followed in darkness be few who perceived advance presently three knight met spear pierced be borne from horse mortally wounded happily english be unaware that be douglas who have fallen have known courage must have be mightily raised day must assuredly have be lost too be ignorant that douglas have fallen still fought on in other part of field march moray be holding own bravely sir ralph percy who have like douglas charged almost alone into moray rank be sorely wounded being surrounded surrendered to sir john maxwell elsewhere many capture be made by party a fight went on advantage turned to side for have rested day before began battle fresh after hour of sleep while english have marched eight league be weary when began fight sir james lindsay sir walter sinclair with other knight who have followed douglas found still alive with last word ordered to raise banner to shout 'douglas so that friend foe must think that be of party instruction followed others pressed forward on hearing shout soon large party being collected resumed battle at point moray march bore array in direction where believed douglas to be battling so together pressed upon english so hardly that retreated for five mile pursued very hotly very many prisoner be taken of quality be at once put to ransom allowed to depart on giving knightly word of payment within fifteen day be great victory in truth none of well knew how have come about for english have fought a well valiantly a did be ill for wearied men to fight against fresh one never be more surprised than when found that battle for time have gone mightily against be yet won in end methinks that be to great extent due to fact that englishman fought for while having on previous day received strictest order to fight man under leader to hold together to obey order in respect kept in company so in end gained day against foe a brave much more numerous than thank uncle armstrong have often wondered how be that percy being three to one against be yet defeated fighting on own ground a be 't be long indeed since suffered so great reverse be true enough oswald in day of wallace bruce scot often won battle with long odds against be because fought on foot english for most part on horseback method good enough on open plain ill fitted for land of morass hill like scotland since english also took to fighting on foot chance have be equal have repulsed invasion not so much by force a by falling back so wasting country that english have choice of retreating starving there be reason indeed why when equal force be arrayed against other chance must also be equal for be come of same stock men of northern march of england of scotland be alike hardy accustomed to war be united people a english be methinks that there must never have be such constant war between for english king must not have cared to have invaded country where must find little spoil have hard work to take noble have always be ready to turn traitor be mostly of norman blood norman name small part of have estate in england a well a in scotland hence be that worst enemy have always be in midst now be time for bed will be heavy in morning know that intend starting at dawn with dog have promised to bring in hare for dinner not only oswald allan janet also be afoot early after taking basin of porridge started for hill accompanied by four dog carried with bow arrow in case dog must drive hare within shot six hour later returned carrying with five hare brace of bird have fallen to oswald bow being shot while on ground for in day idea that be unsportsmanlike to shoot game except when flying be unknown for week went out day sometimes with dog more often with hawk be trained to fly not only at bird in flight at hare on whose head alighted pecking beating so fiercely with wing that gave time for party on foot to run up despatch quarry with arrow once twice accompanied adam armstrong when rode to of town in neighbourhood spent day with friend of armstrong there for fortnight time passed very pleasantly to english lad at end of time adam armstrong returned from visit to jedburgh with grave face have news said that king richard have be deposed that henry duke of lancaster having landed in yorkshire be joined by percy earl of westmoreland have be proclaimed king will cause great trouble in england for surely there must be many there who will not tamely see king dethroned by treasonable practice having just title to crown promoted to place thing be contrary to reason justice king have same right to crown a noble to estate none may justly take away save for treasonable practice king can not commit treason against therefore be like there will be much trouble in england fear that there be chance of truce concludes at end of month being continued fact that two great northern lord of england be with force in south will further encourage trouble peace that with small intermission have continued since battle of otterburn be like to be broken therefore lad think best that must cut short visit by week will return finish when matter have settled down here in scotland be not without trouble ill blood have arisen between march douglas owing to duke of ramsay breaking promise to marry earl of march daughter taking douglas girl to wife too have sorely angered one more powerful than douglas march mean of course albany who really exercise kingly power trouble in scotland will in way prevent war from breaking out with england on contrary quarrel between two great lord

respect like of valiant father addition of young blood to party will indeed not be unwelcome while perchance may learn something from will assuredly be able to tell much that be new of doings on border of nothing vague report have reached ear thanks allonby hotspur said expected nothing le from will of course practise at arm regularly when not occupied in carrying message will be surprised to hear that will go for two hour daily to monastery where have for last three month be learning reading writing at hand of brother roger fighting monk be own desire laudable one when say that have succeeded in giving brother roger satisfaction may well imagine that must have made great progress smile ran round face of esquire for brother roger pugnacious instinct be widely known truly sir henry if brother roger did not lose patience with must be hard indeed if must not get on with in truth desire to improve speaks well for lad disposition when hotspur left allonby said take seat master oswald first have dined took meal hour since with uncle oswald replied ay remember that uncle stick to old hour tell be with father in foray headed to carry off cattle have be lifted by bairds heard report of last night be not with to great disappointment for said that year must pas before must be fit to hold own in fray affair be somewhat hot one three of father men be killed ten twelve of under other leader father several of band be wounded very sorely happened thus then told detail of affair might well have be worse allonby said for have bairds have time to assemble must have gone hardly with father party especially a there be a have heard blood feud between have scored last success oswald said seeing that accompanied sir richard rutherford in raid nigh two month ago a hear while rest came on harrying plundering croquetdale bairds gathering remained at hold found deserted for indeed father must not hope to defend successfully against so large force there employed in demolishing outer wall much of hold must have completed task have not be for defeat inflicted upon rest of scot by sir robert umfraville when be forced to hasten back across border father sent message afterwards saying that mother with follower have be forced to take to fell on return found place well nigh destroyed that be going to set to work to rebuild a before that hoped time to demolish bairds hold in like fashion will be time before place be restored for father mean being limited retainer must have to turn mason a material be there doubted not that in time must make good job of truly be hard life on border squire said be wonderful that can be found willing to live within reach of scotch raider have done fair share of fighting under lord banner to pas life never knowing whether may not awake to find house assailed must be worse than hardest service against open foe now master oswald will go down to courtyard see what instructor have done for in matter of arm with whom have be practising since came here principally with godfrey harpent dick bamborough william anell have have turn with great many of other men at arm three men name be stout fellow good swordsman a borderer suppose that have practised with lance call by such knightly term with be spear nought else borderer carry for fighting for pricking up cattle from time must sit horse have always practised for while day with of father trooper with using blunt weapon whitened with chalk so a to show where hit fell although in charge upon footman border spearmen must couch weapon ride straight at foe in skirmish where can single out enemy there be series of single combat so fight circle round other trusting to agility of horse to avoid thrust to deliver one when there be opening spear be nothing like so heavy a knightly lance thrust with a with point of sword in way can hardly penetrate armour one of other esquire said be only in downright charge that try to do so when be fighting a speak of thrust at face at armpit joint of armour in truth seldom fit closely below breastplate scotch use even le armour than do borderer breast piece being smaller seldom wear back piece be question chiefly of activity of horse a of skill of rider little moor horse be a active a young goat although horse rider can stand charge of heavily armed knight squire methinks that if one of trooper brought to stand must get better of save if knight took to mace battle axe have horse with oswald yes be in stable have gone out with morning a soon a castle gate be opened have ridden for couple of hour before began exercise do take in hand first marsden allonby said to one of younger esquire young man of two three twenty light steel cap with cheek gorget shoulder arm piece padded leathern jerkin be put on then with blunted sword took place facing other squire took up position of easy confidence be good swordsman good naturedly determined to treat lad easily to play with for time before scoring first hit soon however found that game be not to be conducted on line that have laid down oswald after waiting for minute two finding opponent did not take offensive did so for time marsden have work to do to defend several time indeed be with greatest difficulty that guarded head activity of assailant almost bewildered a continually shifted position with cat like spring leapt in dealt blow leaping back again before opponent arm have time to fall finding at last quick a might be marsden blade always met own oswald relaxed effort a be growing fatigued a did so marsden took offensive pressing backwards foot by foot time however that found approaching barrier other obstacle must prevent further retreat oswald with couple of spring managed to shift ground when saw that marsden be growing breathless from exertion again took offensive at last landed blow fairly on opponent helm by faith squire said with laugh have nevertheless little mortification in must a soon fight with wildcat yet breath scarce come fast while have not a much left in a must fill eggshell be excellent display allonby said truly lad activity be wonderful might well puzzle oldest swordsman by such tactic marsden did exceedingly well too many time thought that sword must have gone home up to last guard be always ready in time a for yourself have scarce opportunity of seeing how sword must guard head for trusted always to leg rather than arm well lad will do arm be like iron must have tired long before with sword be little over heavy for a to wind must tire out stoutest swordsman in percy train say that in press of battle where activity must count for little good man at arm must not get better of in single combat with plenty of room must be good man indeed who must tackle especially be clad in armour fighting without only chance must be to get in one downright blow must break down guard a marsden say fight like wildcat rather than a man at arm a time may come when will ride in heavy armour so lose advantage of agility have best continue to practise regularly with men at arm learn to fight in fashion must be needed be engaged in pitched battle when on horseback in armour will be glad indeed to do so oswald said modestly know that be very ignorant of real swordsmanship men at arm have quite at mercy when insist upon not shifting ground at home have only practised with father trooper always fight on foot with stout stick instead of sword without defence save head piece fighting in knightly fashion knew nothing of until came here will soon acquire that lad with strength of arm length of wind quickness of eye activity will make famous swordsman in time ah here be sir henry have be trying lad metal hotspur asked a saw in act of taking off steel cap marsden have already done so that have sir henry find a of proof marsden here who be mean blade have taken in hand lad have more than held own against not so much by swordsmanship a by activity wind be curious contest marsden compared oswald to wildcat comparison be not ill one for indeed spring leap be so rapid sudden that be difficult to follow fight be like one between animal hound marsden defended well against attack until breath failed be dealt downright blow on helm on see have made shrewd dent a for blow fell upon air for lad be ever out of reach before riposte came in own style of fighting must wager on against man at arm in castle be glad to hear said will feel le scruple in sending on mission be not without danger will need training to fit for combat in rank doubt have have opportunity for such teaching must go down before heavy armed man with lance like blade of grass before millstone think not sir henry at least not in single combat for by account horse be a nimble a of course in charge horse must be rolled over a say think not oh well will try have hour to spare do put on suit of full armour sinclair will ride out to course beyond castle what will put on lad will put on only breast piece steel cap only said must have chance against lance sir henry pretend must stand against man at arm armed with sword mace only that thought that with horse must evade shock of fully accoutred man then harass maybe wound with spear well will try lad put on what will get horse saddled will be rare amusement to see so unequal course will be ready in quarter of hour oswald went up to uncle told what be proposed alwyn who have witnessed exercise with rough rider of father smiled grimly if can evade first charge doubt not that can will have at mercy with light spear against lance moor horse against charger put on heaviest of two steel cap strong shoulder piece be like enough that in temper may throw away lance betake to sword will demand that carry mace battle axe that must only carry sword spear horse nimbleness may keep out of harm be a much a can expect hope for put on light breast plate too for in spite of wooden shield to lance head may hurt sorely if doe chance to strike oswald saw that horse be carefully saddled procured from uncle piece of cloth removing spearhead wrapped round head of shaft until formed ball size of fist whitened thickly with chalk in few minute sinclair who be heaviest strongest of esquire rode out into courtyard in full armour sir henry with own esquire several of gentleman of earl household came down hotspur laughed at contrast presented by two combatant one mass of steel with shield lance on warhorse fully caparisoned other slight active looking figure with little defensive armour on rough pony have scarce ounce of superfluous flesh now gentleman said may be engaged in warfare with scot before long will here have opportunity of seeing nature of border fighting combat may seem to ridiculously unequal know moss trooper can tell that in single combat like activity go far to counterbalance weight armour remember how robert bruce before bannockburn mounted on pony struck down sir robert bohun good knight powerful one a party went out through gate to tilting ground outside wall men at arm seeing that something unusual be going to take place crowded up to battlement looking down on ground now gentleman percy said will take place at opposite end of field when drop scarf will charge be understood that need not necessarily ride straight at other that be free to of to do best can to overthrow opponent a gave signal two rider dashed at full speed at other for moment spectator thought that oswald be going to be mad enough to meet opponent in full course when however horse be within length of other rough pony swerved aside with spring like of deer wheeling round instantly oswald followed opponent latter tried to wheel charger a did so be spear struck in vizor leaving white mark on side of slit then too wheeled horse maintaining position on left hand somewhat in rear of opponent who be thereby wholly unable to use lance while oswald marked junction of gorget helmet with several white circle furious at finding incapable of defending of striking blow squire threw away lance drew sword hotspur shouted at top of voice breach of rule breach of rule combat be at end word be unheard in helmet making horse wheel round on hind leg sinclair rode at oswald with uplifted sword latter again couched spear under arm touching horse with spur animal sprung forward before sword must fall point of spear caught squire under armpit hurled sideways from saddle hotspur round ran forward sinclair lay without moving stunned by force with have fallen oswald have already leapt from horse raised sinclair head began to unlace fastening of helmet hotspur face be flushed with anger upbraid lord pray oswald said must scarce have avoided breaking condition helpless a felt must not have heard voice must be lost in helmet pray be not angered with hotspur face cleared at request will not lad said indeed have be punished sufficiently by time that helmet be removed one of soldier from battlement ran out from castle with ewer of water be dashed into squire face presently opened eye heavy fall be thought little of in day a sinclair be raised to foot looked round in bewilderment at who be standing round hotspur said good temperedly well master sinclair lad have given lesson may be useful to must scarce have believed if have not seen that stout soldier in full armour must have be worsted by lad on rough pony see now that advantage be on latter side in combat like with plenty of room to wheel horse why must have slain dozen time sinclair look at vizor that white mark be equal on side of slit have there be spear head on shaft must have pierced to brain joint of armour behind be whitened thrust brought from horse must have spitted through through now let there be ill feeling over be experiment useful one have be in place know must have done aught more than did sinclair be hot tempered of generous disposition held out hand to oswald frankly be fair fight said worsted altogether one bear malice for fair fall in joust condition be not at even oswald said on pony like mine unless have caught in full career be impossible that matter must have turned out otherwise often wondered hotspur said a walked towards gate that chivalry must have be so often worsted by rough scottish trooper now understand scotch always choose broken ground always scatter before get near circling round fall upon chivalry when weight array be of use to happily misadventure have never happened to might well do so scotch too have regard for law of chivalry once behind will spear horse a indeed happened to at otterburn 't be lesson in war one may well take to heart when next fight scot will order on account be mounted men to break rank happens be to move in solid body in case must defy attack upon by light armed horse however numerous at gate of castle alwyn forster met have given more useful addition to following than dreamt of alwyn hotspur said did see conflict watched from wall sir henry felt sure how matter must end lad be quick sharp at border exercise have seen work with father trooper there be not many of who must hold own against in fighting in own way must back moss trooper against best horseman in europe be always accustomed to fight man for though score of men at arm must ride through hundred of if met charge in single combat activity nimbleness of horse must render more than match for fully caparisoned knight so seems hotspur said yet if sinclair have known that lad be about to swerve in course indeed ought to have known for must have be madness to meet charge too must have changed course to left when couple of length away for might be sure that lad must turn way so a to get on left hand in case must have ridden over like thunderbolt yes sir henry oswald must have have eye on knee bridle moment horse changed direction must have be round other way like arrow from bow must have planted a did in squire rear perhaps so hotspur said thoughtfully at rate alwyn boy have given lesson have done good service by presenting to chapter mission for next three four month oswald be little at castle percy utilizing service in manner most agreeable to by sending on errand to various knight gentleman in different part of northumberland to fortified place held by english across border fortnight after contest with sinclair sir henry formally appointed one of esquire be young said for such post a have shown that be well able to take care of in arm a perceive to be shrewd worthy of confidence age matter little a messenger will be more useful travelling a one of esquire than a one without settled rank can not only send written communication by can charge to speak fully in name with authority oswald be not slow in finding out advantage that position gave on first errand on have be sent have be treated a ordinary messenger have be placed at dinner below salt herded with men at arm a esquire of lord percy be treated with courtesy be introduced to lady of family sat at high table be regarded a being in confidence of lord youth excited little surprise acted in favour because be evident that percy must not have nominated a one of esquire have not shown particular merit in journey often passed near yardhope where rebuilding of wall keep be being pushed on with much vigour inhabitant of village in valley lending assistance to restore fortalice regarded a place of refuge in case of sudden invasion by scot parent be greatly pleased at promotion especially mother who have always be anxious that must not settle down to adventurous dangerous life led by father by lady john forster said though be six month since first left have changed rarely speak not of fine garment have grown widened out be fast springing from boy into man be small thing percy must have thought so well of a to make one of esquire already be from merit of mine father because thought that a messenger must be able to speak in name with more authority than have be merely bearer of letter from 't be not only that father replied received letter two day since from brother alwyn written by hand of monk of acquaintance telling that lord percy be mightily pleased with not only because have set to read write from way in have defeated one of esquire in bout at arm alwyn said that doubted not that must win knightly spur a soon a came to full manhood so be clear that merit have something to do with advancement though may be also due to extent to cause assign for monk who wrote letter added on own account that have be preceptor that though have often rated soundly have made wonderful progress monk be good teacher oswald laughed must have made better man at arm than will ever make monk believe pleased more that worsted sinclair indeed be small thing to do seeing that have idea of fighting save of charging straight at foe than at progress made at book command contingent that monastery sends when percy take field to repel invasion must have own will must gladly exchange monk robe for harness of man at arm must wish for stouter companion in fray speed with have performed journey intelligence showed in carrying out mission reporting on issue earned for lad increasing amount of liking confidence on part of lord be not only that delivered reply to hotspur message accurately remark upon personal manner bearing of to whom be sent be of still greater value to percy naturally have promised to have contingent of fighting men ready in case of serious invasion by scot oswald be able to gather from manner whether promise must surely be fulfilled whether in case of trouble knight be more likely to keep array for defence of own castle than to join percy in general movement one day when oswald have be engaged six month at work have taken several time into cumberland westmoreland a well a north lord percy summoned to private apartment hitherto have done well oswald feel now that can trust with mission of far higher importance than have hitherto performed 't be not without danger know that will like none le for reason be young indeed for business of such importance seems to that of around must be best fitted to carry out manner of speech have changed much since came here doubtless can fall at will into border dialect differs little from on other side can pas well enough a coming from jedburgh other place across border world know lad that george earl of march dunbar be mightily offended at rothesay breaking off match with daughter marrying child of rival douglas now be going to tell what world doe not know be secret must cost many life be to be blabbed abroad must not tell have not perfect confidence in discretion anger of march a be mostly called on side of border while in scotland more often call earl of dunbar go beyond mere displeasure with douglas sullen resentment against rothesay have sent confidential messenger to intimating that be ready to acknowledge king a sovereign place force at disposal see be surprised a be indeed natural march have ever be rather for england than for scotland although have never gone so far a to throw off allegiance to scottish throne be not for to consider whether march be acting treacherously to james of scotland whether be acting in good faith towards be easy for to send messenger to since scotland trade with england ship bound for london might well touch at one of port on way down presence of englishman at dunbar must not be so readily explained messenger especially enjoined on not to send communication in writing even by most trustworthy hand since accident might precipitate matter drive to take up arm before be in position to give aid therefore in first place wish to journey to dunbar to see earl deliver to message will give endeavour to inform how far be to be trusted say what will can scarce bring to believe that will really throw off allegiance to scotland save in event of great english army marching north when doubtless must do what most scotch noble have always done namely hasten to give in submission make best term can for 't be business like not although be duty to accept proposal that if made in good faith must be of vast value to king must after seeing earl return here with speed to bear message march may give to report impression a to sincerity good faith 't be month since received message since then have communicated with king have received authority to arrange term with march to guarantee in possession of lordship to hand over to certain tract of douglas country bargained for to assure of support must be told that king urge to delay at present from taking open step a in first place be bound by truce just arranged for next two year in second because having just cause of quarrel with scotland being at present newly seated on throne must have difficulty in raising army for invasion of country king be ready to engage not to renew truce to collect army in readiness to act in concert with a soon a be terminated earl have sent by messenger ring on being presented at dunbar will gain for person who carry immediate access to will also give signet in token that be come from will carry also slip of paper can be easily concealed saying that have full authority to speak in name can explain to have selected for mission because of knowledge of border speech because youth of age can pas unobserved where man might excite attention remark possibly be detained until must render satisfactory account of here be condition set down upon paper take commit to heart then tear paper into shred burn a far a roxburgh can of course ride a squire beyond must travel in disguise have better procure here take with for although governor of roxburgh be trusty knight be best that soul must know that go on mission to march will simply give letter to stating that be engaged in venture in service that horse armour be to be kept for until return thanking lord percy for honour done in selecting for mission promising to carry out to best of power oswald retired making way up to inner room set about learning content of paper given be indeed copy of royal letter to percy when have thoroughly mastered detail must repeat word followed sir henry instruction tore letter up carefully burned fragment then went out into town bought garment suited for travelling unnoticed in scotland dress being almost identical on side of border save for lowland scotch bonnet on return found that lord percy have sent for during absence at once went to apartment have be thinking over matter further sir henry said abbot came in just a left among other thing mentioned that friar roger have again fallen into disgrace having gone so far a to strike sub prior on cheek almost breaking jaw of worthy man that finding discipline punishment of avail with be about to expel in disgrace from community said that have only retained so long on account of goodwill for fellow from fact that must a have often urged be most valuable a leader of abbot force in case of trouble with scot that last offence have passed bearing for time must say nothing for discipline must be maintained in monastery a well a in castle after abbot have left be walking up down in vexation over affair for like rascal in spite of way there be one else who must so well lead contingent of monastery thought occurred to like not going altogether alone for time be lawless might meet trouble on road yet did not see whom must send with now seems to that stout knave must make excellent companion for in first place like like secondly monk travelling north on mission say from abbot to prior of monastery near dunbar must pas anywhere unheeded in third place although a peaceful man must carry military arm might yet take with staff with warrant must be match for two three ordinary men lastly may be able to convince abbot that can thus get rid of from monastery for time avoid scandal occasion yet hold available on return for military service what say lad must like much sir henry must wish for stouter companion although may be quarrelsome with fellow be methinks solely because discipline of monastery fret longs for more active life believe that must be fully trusted to behave discreetly be engaged in outdoor work there can be doubt that be stout man at arm in way must not trust in way with object of mission if obtain abbot consent will simply send for rate soundly for conduct telling make allowance for natural unfitness for vocation have a matter of grace obtained from abbot permission to use service for while to suspend sentence upon until be seen how comports with view be about to send a companion on commission with have intrusted to town of dunbar will hint that if behaves to satisfaction may persuade abbot to allow to remain in service until time come when may be useful to convent for military work still undertaking to drill lay brother keep abbot contingent in good order that when trouble be at end will obtain for full absolution from vow so that may leave monastery without disgrace of being expelled may then take service with with a man at arm wish to be frank with if must rather go alone matter will remain a be must much rather that went with lord from many conversation have have with be sure that be shrewd clever once beyond wall of monastery free to use weapon must be full of resource there be doubtless much lawlessness on side of border although must seem little worth robbing two travel more pleasantly than one monk have taken such pain with have be so kind that there be one with whom must travel with greater pleasure then will go across to monastery at once see abbot doubt not that will grant request for much often a brother roger have given cause for anger know that have sort of kindness for will gladly avoid necessity for punishing disgracing if be arranged monk will come over here see hour later brother roger came in to captain quarter so have be in trouble again brother roger alwyn forster said with laugh a held out hand to have hour ago be lying in prison cell cursing hot temper with a seemed certainty of being publicly unfrocked turned out like mangy dog from pack be not mind that thought of being unfrocked be altogether disagreeable for own be grievously ill fitted for vocation that fast vigil be altogether hateful to must not be pleasant thing to go out into world a one who have be kicked out though might get employment a man at arm must never hope for promotion however well might behave however hour ago cell door be opened be taken before abbot whom found closeted with latter rated soundly said that for sake of otterburn have spoken for to abbot that a must for present be able to make use of in work must be more to liking abbot have consented to reconsider decision must lend to for time in hope that good conduct must in end induce to overlook offence in case might even be induced to take step of le painful description than public disgrace for freeing of gown naturally replied be grateful for lordship intercession that outside monkish office there be nothing must not do to merit kindness told be to report to nephew who must inform of nature of service upon be at first to be employed be to undertake journey with oswald said be going on mission for lord to dunbar object of mission be one concern only be one of importance a road be lonely since march douglas quarrelled order be badly kept on other side of border thought must be better for companion assuredly must wish for none better than for in first place have proved true friend to in second have so much knowledge that will not lack subject for conversation upon journey lastly must get into trouble must reckon upon a match for two three border robber nothing must be more to taste monk said joyfully did not feel quite sure before whether be glad sorry that expulsion be put off for always thought that must come to day now that learn for what service hotspur intends feel a if must shout for joy get flagon of beer good alwyn have drunk water for last twenty four hour be in too great haste to learn what be before even to pay visit to brother cellarer who be stanch friend of mine do go a man at arm master oswald for a mission be clearly of private character disguise may be needful roger will go in own capacity a monk journeying on mission from abbot to head of religious community near dunbar doubt not that lord percy will obtain letter from abbot though may be that there will be no need to deliver still may help on way a be going with will attire a young lay servitor of convent must that have be otherwise monk said with sigh must have travelled far more lightly in heaviest mail harness than in monk robe besides how can carry arm for use in case of necessity can carry staff oswald said laughing being so big man will assuredly require long heavy one even if be heavily shod with iron one need object be not so bad master oswald seven foot staff of thickness of wrist with iron shoe weighing pound two be carnal weapon not to be despised a doubtless know bishop when ride in field always carry mace instead of sword so that may not shed blood though say not that cracking of man skull be to be accomplished without loss thereof however if bishop may lawfully crack man head a eggshell see not that blame can attach to humble most unworthy son of church if slight harm must come to man from use of so peaceful instrument a staff how about young master can carry sword oswald replied in time like man travel unarmed a go a servitor assistant to reverence there will be nothing unseemly in carrying weapon to defend from attack of foe can surely take dagger too dagger be meet companion to sword be sometimes mighty useful in close fight mark take smaller dagger also can be concealed under coat will assuredly do same there be many instance in trifle of kind might come in useful such a for shooting lock of door working out iron bar will do so oswald said though hope there will be occasion such a say for use when do start master oswald tomorrow at daybreak will ride a far a roxburgh will go on own horse though a good animal a be ever saddled have poor appearance have best purchase palfrey a fat sleek a may be found with strength enough to carry weight will be amply provided with money if find bargain let know will give mean mind buy nothing look like warhorse something in keeping with appearance that evening oswald have interview with percy received final instruction bag of money be careful with lad said not so much because of use that may be to because be seized searched by robber others sight of gold might awake suspicion that be not what seemed might lead to long detention keep eye on brother roger see that doe not indulge too much in wine cup that comports rather in keeping with attire than with natural disposition if have difficulty in restraining if doe not obey order send back at once will see again evening be waiting for in apartment now lord having come for money for purchase of palfrey bade get send to when get there when monk appeared before latter said see here monk have saved from punishment become a be surety see that discredit will remember that although young esquire may ask advice benefit by experience be leader order when give be to be obeyed a promptly a if be who spoke to one of men at arm be representative in matter be obeying order a will obey mission be one of importance if fails from fault of yours have better drown in first river come to than return to northumberland think that can trust lord monk said calmly be very poor monk methinks be not bad soldier although go in dress of one will really go a other know that duty a soldier will be to obey even a regard potation own be sometimes deeper than must be methinks that a soldier will be much le thirsty than be a monk if enterprise must fail from default of mine lordship may be sure that will bear advice in mind doubt not that will do well roger must not have sent with esquire on business have not believed that must prove worthy of confidence know that man may be good soldier even wise counsellor though may be very bad monk next morning pair rode out from castle at daybreak roger be dressed in usual monkish attire of time long loose gown with cape head covering resembling small turban rode compactly built little horse seemed scarce capable of carrying weight ambled along with a if scarcely felt oswald be dressed a lay servitor in tightly fitting high hose short jerkin girt in by band at waist going half way down to knee rode own moorland horse carried on arm basket with provision for day march wore small cloth cap fell down to neck behind uncle accompanied to gate be by order opened to give egress goodbye lad said know not wish to know object of journey be enough for that be confidential mission for hotspur be proud that must have be chosen for feel convinced that will prove have merited lord confidence goodbye friend roger let love of fisticuffs hard knock carry away try bear a if be still in monastery with abbot keeping eye upon brother roger laughed make cold shiver run down back alwyn be feeling a if have just got out of cold cellar into sunshine must shout with very lightness of heart be not in least disposed to quarrel with anyone so let mind be easy a to doings will be discretion even if be called upon to strike will do so a gently a may be putting only such strength into blow a will prevent opponent from troubling further so with wave of hand rode on have better strap staff beside saddle under knee oswald said when have ridden short distance carry a if be spear have seen already three four people smile a passed roger reluctantly allowed oswald to fasten staff beside one want something in one hand said on foot doe not matter so much now be on horseback again feel that ought to have spear in hand sword dangling at side must remember that be still monk roger although enlarged for season day perhaps will be able to gratify desire in way have best moderate speed of horse for although amble along merrily at present can never carry that great carcase of yours at pace through journey must like one good gallop roger sighed a pulled at rein horse proceeded at pace better suited to appearance of rider nice figure must look with robe streaming behind oswald laughed there must soon be story going through country of mad monk now take turning to right here leave main north road for be bound in first place to roxburgh thought that must be that berwick though asked question will not travel like beyond roxburgh will journey forward on foot supposed that must come to master oswald for otherwise must not have told to provide with staff journeyed pleasantly along whenever approached town large village oswald reined back horse little so that head be on level with roger stirrup slept that night at kirknewton where put up at small hostelry oswald have intended going to monastery there roger begged so earnestly that must put up elsewhere that yielded to must have end of question asked a to journey across border object roger said always go against conscience to have to lie unless upon pressing occasion moreover oswald said with laugh might be expected to get up to join community at prayer at midnight might give monk bed instead of more comfortable one in guest chamber there may be something in roger admitted have so often to sleep on stone bench for punishment of offence own to weakness for soft bed when can get one however oswald be pleased to see that follower behaved at resting place with more discretion than must have hoped for although somewhat surprised host by heartiness of appetite on other hand be moderate in potation talked little retiring to bed of thick rush at curfew in truth be afraid to trust said to oswald a lay down side by side never have felt so free since otterburn never indeed since unfortunate day when be wounded conceived fatal idea of becoming monk two three time impulse to troll out trooper song be so strong in have to clap hand over mouth to keep in 't be well did roger for assuredly if have so committed on first day of starting must have sent back to alnwick feeling that must not be safe for to proceed with farther when get upon cheviot tomorrow may lift voice a choose be best that confined to latin canticle even there for habit of breaking into song of other kind might grow upon will do so roger said seriously of canticle have plenty of ring go word matter not seeing that understand next morning resumed journey crossed cheviot be here comparatively low hill after four hour riding arrived at roxburgh why do come here roger asked must surely have be much shorter have travelled through berwick along coast road much shorter roger sir henry thought better that must go inland to haddington thence east to dunbar a thus entering town must seem that came from edinburgh from western monastery whereas did journey by coast road might be guessed that have come from england a before put up at hostelry oswald then proceeded on foot to governor house soldier be loitering at door what do want lad one of asked a came up have letter be charged to deliver into governor own hand complaint suppose from worthy prior who have lost of beef maybe governor will inform if ask oswald replied will pull ear for when come out young jackanapes soldier said hotly that danger must even risk business first pleasure afterwards while other soldier burst into fit of laughter at astonishment of comrade at what deemed insolence of young servitor of monastery quietly entered guard at door who have heard colloquy led into governor room messenger with letter desire speech with sir philip said bid enter knight said briefly oswald entered bowed deeply waited until door closed behind attendant then said be bearer of letter sir from lord percy to knight looked at in surprise hotspur have chosen strange messenger muttered to a took missive oswald held out to cut silk bound with dagger read content a laid down rose to foot excuse want of courtesy said lord percy tell that be one of esquire slight recommendation that be intrusted with somewhat important mission on part to dunbar still higher recommendation for assuredly must not have selected for purpose have not stood high in regard indeed at first took for what seemed a

governor went downstairs followed by soldier who have not yet recovered from surprise at seeing oswald seated evidently on familiar term with lord oswald said nothing to until arrived at golden rose then led way to stable handed horse over to suppose that pulling of ear will be deferred for time said with smile to soldier who have made remark man sheepishly took hold of bridle must not tell sir began of course must not oswald interrupted still may be lesson to that be just a well not to make fun of people until be quite sure who be there bear malice get yourselves stoup of wine in payment for service thought that there be something out of way about other man said a walked up street with two horse must never have turned upon a did be evident that be someone of consequence be here on secret business other with sir philip be well that did not bear malice for must have got hot from governor have reported what said to chapter at dunbar journey passed without incident of importance oswald have reason to congratulate on having taken monk with on one occasion a be passing over wild heath party of eight ten men on rough pony rode up be armed with spear sword reined up with exclamation of disappointment a roger who have rolled up robe round waist for convenience of walking let fall round have played scurvy trick monk leader said angrily who be to guess be monk who be thus striding along must find difficult to walk with robe dangling about heel roger said whither be bound whence be going be travelling to dunbar being sent to convent of saint magnus there come from roxburgh 't be shame so stalwart fellow a be must be leading drone life in convent when true scotsman be sharpening spear in readiness for what may come when truce with england expires be glad to hear that be so well employed roger replied methinks that in day like be sometimes useful to have few men of thews sinew even in religious house for there be who sometimes fail in respect owe to church be true enough men laughed well go thy way there be naught to be gained from travelling monk naught good friend save occasionally hard blow when monk happens to be of strength stature carry staff like 't be goodly weapon in sooth look a if knew how to wield even monk may know that seeing that staff be not carnal weapon rolling up sleeve roger took staff in middle with hand in manner of quarterstaff made play round head with speed vigour showed that be complete master of exercise enough enough man said while exclamation of admiration broke from others truly from such champion strong enough to wield weapon resembles weaver beam rather than quarterstaff there must be more hard knock than silver to be gained be more pity that such skill strength must be thrown away in convent perhaps be a well that be wearing monk gown for methinks eight to one a be of might have got broken head before gained few penny in pocket come on men better luck next time be clear that man be not one be charged to capture with follower rode off across moor think that be what seem oswald said a resumed journey man speech be not that of border raider follower must hardly have sat horse so silently obeyed order so promptly have be merely thieving caterans besides marked that said be not man be watching for whom think that be then master oswald think possible that may be party of douglas follower led by knight may be douglas have received hint of march being in communication with england that have sent party to seize search traveller who looked like messenger from south of course may be only fancy still be right glad that be wearing monkish robe for have be alone might have be cross questioned so shrewdly a to purpose in travelling that might have be held on suspicion mean employed to get truth out of at small town where stopped next night learned that many complaint have be made by traveller from south of how have be stopped by party of armed men on border closely questioned searched in case robbed have be going on for week sheriff of county have twice collected armed force ridden in search of robber altogether without success be believed that be stranger to district description given of have not agreed with of noted bad character in neighbourhood certainly master oswald monk said seems to support idea money valuable be soon found by what men say of way in clothes belonging of traveller be searched must seem to show money be not object of band rather discovery of correspondence money be only taken a cloak have doubt that be there to intercept someone roger though may not have be percy messenger still be well rid of hope that will meet more on way hope be fulfilled reached dunbar without further interruption here deemed better to separate monk went to convent gave out there that be on way to edinburgh being on journey thither to see aged father who be in last sickness oswald went to shop bought clothes suited for son of trader in fair position changing thing at inn where have put up made way to castle must have speech with earl said to warder at gate have order to wait upon what be name condition that matter not be here by earl order sent ring by might be known that be authorized to have access to on seeing ring warder at once called to one of servitor bade conduct oswald to earl apartment whom will say asked when reached door give ring to say that bearer awaits admittance to man entered room then opening door again motioned to oswald to enter earl tall powerfully built man looked with keen scrutiny at from whom come young sir from holder of ring lord earl oswald said presenting ring percy have given name be oswald forster have honour to be one of lord percy esquire come alone earl asked came with companion monk be in disguise of young servitor of convent came on foot from roxburgh then unscrewed handle of dagger percy have given for purpose pulled out small roll of paper handed to earl contained only following word intrust undue confidence in bearer matter wot of be in good train of messenger know nothing be so writ by sir henry percy said oswald in order that if be detained searched on way paper found on might not be forced by torture to say aught of message signet ring must have shown to whom be coming be concealed in staff lord must not have be discovered have not that be split open have be so must have admitted that lord percy have indeed committed signet writing to to carry have bid travel a servitor of monk on journey north that more than that be to be delivered to knew nothing lord percy selected a messenger partly because from youth must not be likely to be suspected of being messenger between two great lord in second place because if arrested matter found on statement in letter must be readily believed must not be supposed that important state secret must be committed to lad like earl made reply for time sat with eye fixed on oswald face a if be reading thoroughly then do know matter in question do lord be bearer of further communication to say on then lord percy bid say that on receipt of message to forwarded by one of knight to king at westminster that matter be discussed by majesty with two three of most trusted councillor after full consideration king have accepted offer will grant condition sent lord also document with royal seal attached engaging to observe condition of compact document lord percy hold to be given to on convenient occasion deemed of so important nature that must be too hazardous to send to king in letter to lord percy begged to tell that so long a truce continued must not collect army to support that a time for termination approached must begin to do so must be in readiness to take field in north immediately move in matter earl sat for time in thought do know condition of compact asked suddenly oswald have expected question felt sure that earl who be when not inflamed by anger cool cautious man must highly disapprove of hotspur frankness might possibly detain if knew that possessed so important secret therefore replied a to such grave matter be not necessary must know more than have said to lord earl a be secret that douglas have personal enmity deemed that compact referred to king giving aid must need against douglas answer be apparently satisfactory earl asked further question on head be there other reason than have stated why chose a messenger reason gave lord be that a came of family who reside within few mile of border have relative on side whom sometimes visited language be similar to spoken in roxburghshire so must therefore pas a lowland scot without difficulty one in fact at various place at have stopped have taken for aught countryman though monk with be often taxed with being englishman though belonging to monastery at roxburgh again earl be silent for time must think over message will give for percy said like not delay though see that there be good reason for a one of hotspur esquire must fain treat with courtesy lodge here might cause question a to who be be therefore better that must lodge in town have put up anywhere rested for hour at sign of lion lord engaging room there in order to effect change in clothes left by back entrance in order that change must not be observed be best that fetched travelled in away rather that returned unnoticed a be getting dark now can doubtless be managed when sally out place cloak over shoulder to hide dress a servitor go to other inn falcon say there that be staying for few day in dunbar having come here on business with that bade go there so that might know where to send for if necessary can pas for what seem young trader who have come from edinburgh to arrange on part of father cloth merchant there for supply of stuff for clothing of retainer oswald carried out instruction walked about until be quite dark then entered inn made way unobserved to chamber where have left clothes put on made others up into bundle then went downstairs again paid bill saying a did so that have found friend came to see that have room to take in after leaving house threw cloak have carried on arm over shoulder put on cap belonged to other dress then went to falcon inn repeating to landlord statement earl have made be at once shown to chamber with deference will worship have supper here in room below will come down said be dull work sitting alone having ordered supper with flask of wine oswald again donned attire a trader went downstairs just a entered room in several person be sitting soldier came in from outer door looked round room have message from earl for person who be with afternoon oswald at once rose went across to earl bade tell soldier said in low voice that present furnisher be robert micklethwaite that place of business be near castle gate at edinburgh please thank earl for information oswald replied then returned to seat have indeed while dressing be wondering what name must give be like enough that in dunbar many might know name of principal trader in edinburgh be to give unknown one might be questioned a to place of business message therefore relieved of difficulty after have finished supper be excellent one beckoned to landlord be stranger here landlord said pray to drink cup with tell news of place may know name of micklethwaite went on a landlord sat down that come sends regularly to arrange for supply of cloth quality price required for earl retainer master micklethwaite always put up here when visit dunbar landlord said must have misunderstood for one day when be talking with said that be trouble to that have son have oswald said luckily for who be nephew be good customer landlord went on good company too care not for french wine doe not trouble cellarer much be careful man oswald said with smile though be good trencherman doe not waste money on such matter however let have freer hand than us asks not when return for close account of outgoings what do say here a to chance of war with england fear worst landlord replied war be ruin to have have english at gate of dunbar over many time already town sacked burnt over head more than once though say that might not have be worse for earl have ever stood aloof a much a possible have often inclined towards english side still even then be bad enough for whole country from berwick have often be wasted to check progress of army trade well nigh ruined pest on war say way think that present earl leaning must go think not about one way other business be to sell food liquor earl to take part in affair of state in day like be quite enough for man to attend to own business without troubling about of other people more especially when other be powerful noble who think little enough of slitting tongue that wag too freely lad john sanderson be fool know better than to open mouth touching affair of great noble know not how may be with burgher of edinburgh here be content to cool own porridge let others take food hot cold a choose be not wishing to give so much own idea a common talk of town see that question be indiscreet ask pardon know meant harm lad that question be just one young man of age might ask without thinking that there be harm in that answering of might lead to harm can tell that folk may think here in dunbar say naught about to nearest neighbour can talk of war with england be too common thing for there to be harm in a one know aught one man opinion be a good a talk be general assuredly man asks neighbour what great lord will do how matter will go there be harm in two gossip wondering whether if english come town will hold out till help come whether will batter down wall first be kind of riddle see more that one know who may be by king side when storm break generation back men might make fair guess now be beyond wisest head to say for part leave thinking to whom concern from edinburgh ought to know more than do for in great city men can talk more freely seeing that one lord have place in hand that citizen have right hold to general thought be that will have war directly truce be over among who live by peaceful trade still hope for peace for see not what good come of war save to who make raid in england a often a not get more hard knock than plunder to quiet trader mean loss may well mean ruin if english army again march through scotland can discover reason why two country must not live peaceably together going about own business have heard said before now that must be good thing for country if border district on side be stripped altogether of people allowed to lie desolate ay must be rare thing that be thieving loon on side of border keep up ill feeling loss must not be great seeing that there be plenty of waste tract where people might be bestowed pas time more profitably in raising crop cattle than in destroying carrying off of neighbour however young sir be not like to be in time be afraid not sanderson must need make best can of thing a stand think 'twould be well if english do come north again capture edinburgh ruin trade for year to cross sea to france take service there scarce spoken like peaceful trader landlord laughed doubt not must make good soldier that sword must suit hand to full a well a yard measure well make not so much difference to men must eat drink though wine must be drunk up without payment must have to run risk of being killed on wall if english came must know that in short time men must come go a before that will drink good wine if have money to pay for in six month trade must be a brisk a ever men seem to think that time will be scot who will invade england for english baron have have enough of war in france will be slow in furnishing quota when called on that will carry fire sword through northern county that may do though northumberland hotspur will doubtless have something to say to fear will be a have be many time before army will march back with plunder news of damage done will inflame england then great army will march north noble will hasten to make term for harm damage will fall upon quiet people who have nought to do with invasion true enough young sir true enough though be shame that must be said have city voice in matter of peace war may be right sure that must hear more of invasion trouble from side of border say not that there must be peace for claim of english king to authority in scotland although have not heard so much of since bannockburn be in abeyance first time that there be really peace between france may be sure that will hear of again then town a well a country must join heartily in repelling invasion never did so in past time sanderson generally opened gate at once if closed be because there be strong garrison under knight noble who not townspeople have say in matter now methinks will to bed for have have long day travel next day passed without message from earl on following morning one of retainer from castle came in with message that earl desired presence of mr micklethwaite oswald went up at once earl be a before alone have be thinking master forster that must be safer for for be to tarry here for while came through safely be true might not have such good fortune on return even though sent written answer must be enough be percy signet found upon to ensure imprisonment perhaps death at rate must have mean of wringing from mission of be in charge while must send equally well message by sea a did before see that there might be slight danger lord earl oswald said quietly a well a might take passage down by ship touching at berwick other port earl brow clouded 't be matter to be thought over said moodily ship might be captured seeing that there be often french freebooting vessel on coast be order from lord percy be to return immediately have conveyed message to must gladly hasten departure earl said after moment pause see great issue hang upon affair however will think matter over again will see how can be best managed after leaving castle oswald went to convent where monk be lodged asked for speech with brother roger in minute two latter came out be off young master asked in truth be a bad here a at alnwick after taste of liberty be longing to be out again indeed have have trouble in accounting for stay here instead of continuing journey to see aged father if depended upon must say that must start forthwith what have somewhat feared along have come to pas be bearer of certain message of much importance from hotspur to earl fear that latter will detain think that know more than have said indeed be true like not that one who be so entirely cognisant of secret counsel intention must go free put down to fact might be captured on way back forced to confess whole detail of mission with be charged be possible that be so be more likely that dislike that anyone must know secret concern safety although have not said a much at present believe that be intention to hold here a prisoner though doubtless with due courtesy a befits percy messenger esquire until affair come to head may not be for year two yet be there guard over at present not that know of roger may be that inn be watched at rate must try to overtake did attempt to leave without permission then master oswald must say let be off at once how roger on foot must be speedily overtaken if not watched at present doubtless will be after interview with earl morning be to try buy horse might be arrested at once however have be thinking that best plan must be for to go round to port to bargain for passage for to edinburgh then must slip on board quietly hour before sailed methinks be a well that did not go in robe will purchase dress suitable to cattle drover for similar one for myself will bring yours for here in hour time if will wait hundred yard from gate for then can go to quiet spot change garment then go down to port will be standing at door of inn a pas say without checking pace hour at boat sail today tomorrow then do be near hotel again hour before time speak to a come out keep short distance behind if see that be followed by anyone must do best to rid of have better bring present garment along with may be useful roger assented joyously thought at rate for time be to get rid of robe filled with joy possibility that there might be danger in enterprise only added to pleasure feeling need for great care oswald walked for little time before entering shop passing through several quiet street when assured that be not followed went into booth of clothier have occasion for two suit of clothes such a must be worn by cattle drover said be about to travel having money about can best do so safely in such garment want one suit to fit for companion who be big stout man good deal above ordinary height 't be wise precaution honour for road be by mean safe at present can fit with ease will pick out largest clothes have in stock for companion purchase be soon made consisted of rough smock of blue cloth reaching to knee girded in by strap at waist breech of same material reaching below knee with strip of gray cloth to be wound round round leg from knee to ankle in addition oswald bought two pair of rough sandal two lowland bonnet suit be done up at request in separate parcel then retracing step joined roger handed clothes to will go outside gate change thing roger said then go down to port will then come to hotel a said if ship sail until tomorrow have only to put robe on over garment return to convent if there be one sailing evening will not go back there again will be on lookout for hour before boat leaf port nearer time of sailing better roger for if be watched there be trouble with man who follows sooner be on board before alarm be raised better must hardly think boat must start in evening know master oswald be down at port yesterday tide be high at three o'clock methinks that boat must put out hour two before low tide so a to take water with a far a new berwick there catch flood flowing into firth in case boat must put out at six maybe seven o'clock must that have be two hour later roger after dark be easy enough to silence man without attracting much attention in broad daylight must not be so easily done not if went straight from inn to port master there be need for to take that route be right roger indeed must be better not to do so for be to have idea that have escaped by water earl might send fast boat after therefore when come out will turn off go by unfrequented street lane in opposite direction in way will be better able to see if be followed may find quiet place where can give man clout on head will rid of will come out master oswald in present attire in disguise will wear cloak headgear will put legging over others so that will have to take off fling aside to throw off cloak cap put on bonnet of will not take minute can be done in doorway passage without attracting observation must be afraid to go out in drover attire servant at inn know now moreover man of such condition must not think of going to falcon be to be noticed coming out might be thought that have entered for evil purpose will be on hand master have thought of not returning to monastery must do so for have left staff there will be a suitable for drover a monk will go to harbour a soon a have seen if be evening boat sail will go back at once bid farewell saying that ship be sailing for leith have taken passage in oswald returned to inn hour later went down to doorway where stood a if idly watching flow of traffic quarter of hour later saw roger approaching looked character that have assumed to life have dirtied hand face smudged smock with stain of mud strolled along with free step head erect did not look at oswald a passed said boat sail at seven tonight oswald stood for time longer short distance down street observed two of earl retainer be standing apparently looking at good in mercer window after time moved on short distance passed inn stopped again to look in shop twenty thirty yard away then oswald left door landlord be standing in passage beckoned to to enter private room young sir said not whether have done anything have displeased earl be business of mine be fair spoken young gentleman must not that ill came to like not to meddle in earl affair for must think nothing of ordering house to be burnt over head however may warn that be making inquiry about one of retainer have be here two hour ago with confidential message from earl to inquire whether have said anything about leaving to bid send message to secretly must do so thank warmly good host oswald replied have have quarrel with earl have differed a to value of good requires must fain have at last year price wool have gone up must not sell save at loss may be that think will go away that if find be about to do so will send for agree to term indeed be so low that leave little profit however be well that must let know how much owe will pay at once make up account tell roundly there thereabouts then must leave suddenly can say truly have not asked for bill that be altogether ignorant of intention of leaving there can be occasion for that host said can pay next time come must decide to leave suddenly nay must rather settle obligation for if do business with earl may be time before return landlord made rapid calculation named sum oswald at once handed to with warm thanks for warning have given may stay here three four day longer said meaningly a earl may at last moment come to agreement a to price of good must be sorry to return to uncle without getting order for earl have for year be one of best customer landlord nodded understand said must be a well perhaps that must say a much in hearing of one of drawer so that if questioned will have witness who can bear out chapter back to hotspur be still broad daylight when at past six oswald left inn sauntered at leisurely pace down street eye at once fell on roger tall figure also saw two retainer of earl loitering about be not same men have seen in morning doubtless have relieved on watch took first turning off main street after passing through several lane found at foot of town wall narrow lane ran between row of small house one be about thought that roger must take advantage of loneliness of spot to endeavour to rid of follower whose footstep must hear distance behind presently glanced carelessly round men be thirty forty yard behind coming up with at rapid step be roger minute later heard voice raised in anger where be going fellow there be plenty of room to pas without pushing between want teaching manner roger gave loud laugh who be going to teach said will one of men said angrily placing hand upon sword hilt a did so be levelled to ground by tremendous blow from roger staff with shout other soldier drew sword before must guard staff again descended fell senseless beside comrade roger at once knelt beside tore off strip of garment rolling up pressed into mouth with string have brought for purpose tied in place then taking out few piece of cord tied hand behind ankle together dragged into dark entry left lying there whole transaction have occupied two three minute have attracted attention whatever soldier shout might have be heard there be clashing of weapon shout be too unimportant matter for anyone within hearing to take trouble about oswald seeing that roger needed assistance have occupied with stripping off outer pair of legging have made with cloak cap into bundle pressing drover cap down over eye be ready by time roger came up to be splendidly managed roger did well enough other said carelessly may be hour before anyone stumble over long before that will be at sea made way back through quiet lane until near port then boldly went down to side of small craft be just in time men skipper said in five minute must be throwing off rope hoisting sail now that have come will do so at once tide be just right for have nothing further to stop for boat be large fishing smack have put into dunbar afternoon with intention of disposing of catch two others have however come in still earlier market being glutted skipper have determined to take catch be heavy one on to leith have agreed for very small sum to carry two drover to port oswald roger aided in getting up sail in few minute smack be at sea wind be from southwest boat ran rapidly up coast earl will be in nice way when find that have gone roger said a stood in stern to watch rapidly receding tower of dunbar there will be hot hue cry for earl be not accustomed to be thwarted say that be mighty hot tempered man have doubt that a soon a fellow bring word of what have happened to find that have quitted inn will send party of horse out to scour road to berwick haddington to search country far near be welcome to do oswald said fear be that will send down to port to inquire if craft put out about hour at men be attacked even if doe so there be great chance of being overtaken be travelling fast in hour will be dark long before daybreak will reach leith having wind tide in favour way kept anxious watch a long a there be light enough for to make out if vessel left dunbar fancied that must see sail just a twilight be falling must be sure that be not effect of imagination be already ten mile away a tide have now begun to make along shore be certain that for time at least ship however fast might be must gain little upon until have fairly entered firth there must be moon even must overtake might well pas in dark when lay down agreed that must keep awake in turn that if made out ship apparently pursuing must offer skipper full value for boat betake to row for shore greatest danger roger said must be of passing unseen then lying to near entrance of port overhauling a came in be danger that can not guard against can swim roger be year since have done so monk replied used to do so in old day there be empty cask here by side went on if be challenged best plan must be to lower down quietly into water to hold on by boat must certainly go distance before have lost way brought up must be out of sight of ship before came together be good idea if hear hail will at once cut good length of rope twist round barrel for to hold on by think there be chance of being overhauled agree with in respect still be just a well to have plan prepared in case must happen kept vigilant watch through night without catching sight of craft proceeding in same direction a be still dark when helmsman hailed skipper see light of leith ahead later passed beacon fire marked entrance to port five minute later companion after paying sum agreed on stepped on shore that danger be over did not think that there be real cause for fear must like to see earl a band of horseman ride in today with news that can hear nothing of must like to hit just clout with staff a gave two retainer roger said earl a be be scandalous contrary to usage to arrest messenger especially when messenger be esquire of one of equal rank to message a suppose friendly one so much blame have mean of judging discretion consequence to others have fallen into hand of douglas of marauding leader might have be serious indeed doubt not have be content to stay with must have treated with honour might even have done so have got to send messenger to percy latter bade to return at once moreover said that have mission a soon a have carried present one to successful termination have done so master oswald yes think so roger be to ascertain earl real intention regarding certain matter think that mean honestly to adhere to offer made very fear that have shown lest intention must be betrayed seems to prove that be most anxious that naught must occur to interfere with plan earl of dunbar have ever be treacherous race roger said earnestly ready to betray own countryman in order to curry favour with england continue in possession of estate however a have benefited from need not grumble if scot be contented now master oswald what be to do next must say that have better find corner to lie down until daybreak think that of have slept then will go into tavern breakfast afterwards go on to edinburgh must like to see town castle chance may never come again to then tomorrow morning will start in earnest will have plenty of opportunity to talk over plan so let lose time now in looking for bed fortunately soon came upon fishing net carelessly piled under lee of stack of timber here threw down be soon fast asleep when woke sun be well up fisherman be preparing to get up sail who have like come in during night be commencing to unload cargo look there oswald exclaimed a pointed to vessel from whose masthead floated flag with arm of earl of march be just entering port did chase after see did not gain on fishing boat well methinks that have better be off at once roger said will soon learn boat have come from dunbar find out from men be disguise worn by so have best lose time in getting out of leith must never dare to seize here oswald said know that if have strict order to bring back must not feel much hesitation in seizing wherever found knowing well enough that burgher of leith must not concern greatly about capture of two drover who must probably be charged with sort of crime be one of own citizen must be different be scarce likely that burgher must care to quarrel with powerful noble for sake of two stranger of low degree gate will be open before will be safer in edinburgh than be here accordingly postponed breakfast passing through town without pause issued out by south gate walked briskly to edinburgh a soon a arrived found small tavern partook of hearty meal listening while ate to conversation going on around found that young duke of rothesay be at present staying at castle men say that dispute between uncle duke of albany have of late grown hotter might well be said rothesay be man now have shown brave soldier be not likely that must support with patience haughtiness overbearing manner of albany be evil day for scotland when good king who be then prince lamed for life so be forced on accession to leave conduct of affair to albany then earl of fife king a men know be just good have at heart welfare of subject accident have rendered unfit to take part in public affair love peace quiet a much a albany love intrigue dark devious way 't be sore pity that king can not make up mind to throw into arm of douglas call upon nobility to join in expelling albany from council to give charge of affair into hand of rothesay even to bestow upon kingly dignity while retires to peaceful life love must have be better done other said before young duke married for many of noble who must have otherwise supported must hold aloof seeing that accession of rothesay must be handing over real power of state from albany to douglas men say that feud between march douglas grows hotter hotter that boldness with march upbraided king for breaking off by rothesay of marriage with elizabeth of dunbar have so angered rothesay albany who have aided in bringing about match with elizabeth douglas that 't be like march will ere long be arraigned for conduct threat that uttered in passion well gossip matter little to elderly man said whether king prince duke be master have to pay assuredly be rothesay king tax must not abate seeing that be extravagant reckless though say not that have not many good quality benefit in way men like while taxation to support extravagance touch there be murmur of assent from little group who be talking who struck oswald a being farmer who have come in from country to sell cattle to butcher of town be interrupted in talk by landlord who came across to good friend said pray talk not so loudly concerning prince noble be true that be royal city that burgher of edinburgh have right liberty nevertheless be dangerous to talk loud concerning noble be quiet people none here wear cognizance of douglas albany still must do much harm be reported that there have be talk here concerning such powerful noble though douglas might care little what be said of methinks that there be others name name who must spare neither great small who incurred resentment knew not that be talking loudly john ker methinks that none save two men at near table have heard word look honest fellow enough still what say be right while may talk of thing by fireside be best to keep silent tongue while abroad need not disquiet about roger broke in have communion with lord prince so that can drive herd safely down into cumberland care not whether one noble have king ear have just returned from england well man may put in way of getting job if want one eldest of party said have small farm near lavingston breed cattle for edinburgh market have brother at lanark who buy cattle up in north when there be peace between country sends drove down to carlisle make good profit on sale saw two hour ago told that be daily expecting lot of cattle from north that intended to send on without delay to carlisle if say to that have seen recommended to call on see if wanted drover to aid in taking down doubt not will take on unless have already engaged men thank for offer roger said home lie near roxburgh intend to abide there for time for road be by mean safe at present douglas be thinking more of quarrel with dunbar than of keeping down border freebooter escaped time heard of taking heavy toll from herd followed of killing two three drover who offered objection so have determined to abide at home for time to see how matter go after taking brief view of town started in afternoon to walk to dalkeith where slept leaving there at daybreak crossed lofty range of hill came down into lauderdale have fear of interruption such a have experienced before a have douglas news of negotiation going on between march england must not think necessary to watch road between edinburgh border late in evening arrived at ancrum on teviot having done fully fifty mile since starting ten mile in morning took to roxburgh here put up at small tavern oswald donned servitor suit that have brought with from dunbar while roger to great disgust resumed monk gown put on over drover suit oswald then went to governor former acquaintance happened to be at door endeavoured to atone for former rudeness by at once ushering to governor room welcome back master forster latter said mission whatever be be speedily terminated from what said have not looked for for fortnight if have not come when did oswald said absence might have be prolonged for month however have gone well purpose starting at once for alnwick must fain reach wooler by nightfall that can do easily enough will order horse to be saddled at once thank sir philip will mount here in courtyard care not now what notice may be taken of seeing that there be ten mile to be ridden to frontier warrant will meet with interference on road knight said have not heard of anyone being stopped for toll for past year between

intercept messenger on whom might find letter from whom must extract proof of earl treachery 't be like enough hotspur said when man be so rash a to upbraid king still more albany must need fall under suspicion now go on with story when oswald have brought narration to end percy said have done very well oswald have deserved confidence placed in have shown much circumspection did well in escaping

therefore pray take elsewhere have striven long to make worthy member of order feel that be beyond must be best therefore that must go own way may come to be worthy soldier so justify in allowing to unfrock a be abiding in castle pray bid present here tomorrow must fain speak to give such advice concerning future conduct a may be of benefit to when roger returned from monastery next day wore much more serious face than usual abbot have done more good by talk morning said to oswald than by lecture penance have ever imposed on in truth be good man have half mind to say must return to convent do best to comport mildly becomingly felt that must not do oswald thing be too strong for however might strive know when temptation came must break out again so held peace what did say to roger said many thing gist of be that there be a good men outside wall of monastery a there be within that soldier have a many opportunity indeed many more opportunity of showing good man a monk have in battle said soldier must act a such fight stoutly against enemy take life a well a risk own after fight be over must show merciful if can not follow out precept to love enemy must at least be compassionate kind to above all must never oppress helpless must comport honourably kindly to woman child if necessary draw sword in defence against who must ill use though spoil of war be honourable necessary when captured in fair fight yet oppression robbery of poor be deadly crime always roger a if though soldier in arm be still monk at heart be brave strong may rise to honour whether may bear a if be of gentle blood wore knightly spur not who be so be honourable merciful a have vowed to be remember will hear of from time to time through lord percy that will gladden to have good account of to feel have not done wrong in letting go forth from house of rest to take part in turmoil strife of world said more than be pith of knelt down swore must strive to utmost in power to do a bade put hand on head bade go in peace tell mean to prove to that word have not be in vain two day later oswald started with roger rode to warkworth castle ten mile away bearing order to governor to add roger to strength of garrison telling that have shown to be brave soldier skilful one that must place confidence in appoint to sub command might become vacant on way entered wood here roger took off monastic garb clad in armour such a be worn by garrison of alnwick monk clothes be made up into bundle left in wood oswald saying will carry back with on return roger may be that may come in useful yet if travel together again in percy ' service month passed then earl of march came by sea to alnwick douglas regent have marched against with overwhelming force a be personal enemy knew that fate must be sealed if fell into hand have therefore be driven to declare openly a vassal of english king on day after arrival happened to be in hotspur room when oswald entered ah ah said be messenger percy left with scant notice sir smiled be forced to do so lord earl for in truth be not sure that must not prevent from following lord order to return after seeing be right in first place be not sure that be true messenger in second place feared that might on return fall into hand of douglas who must speedily find mean to wring from account of mission therefore thought that be best that must tarry while with at dunbar young fellow have good head lord percy be a hard to hold a wildcat put matter of watching into hand of two three of men whose wit have tried more than once know to be among most trustworthy of follower lad however outwitted how have never be able to explain fellow be found trussed up like fowl for roasting in alley into have be thrown having a declared be knocked down by giant fellow who sprung from knew not where just a be about to lay hand upon messenger after have vanished none have seen pas wall judged that must have started in craft sailed up forth fearing that if landed might speedily fall into hand of douglas sent vessel in chase missed indeed from time to knew not save by letter to whether have reached here safely after short stay earl of march be about to return to dunbar when heard that king be coming north with army for invasion of scotland must then confer with consider term on proposed to transfer allegiance to month later king arrived at alnwick there george dunbar earl of march entered into agreement with in renounced fealty to king of scotland in consideration for be granted estate in lincolnshire other revenue be also agreed that subject of king of england must support earl in time of necessity must be supported by received into fortress be not now in position to render very efficient aid to king for robert maitland nephew to whom have committed castle of dunbar have be summoned by douglas who have marched there with strong force by order of king have surrendered stronghold to however brought dunbar wife family considerable force of retainer safely across border percy together then made raid into douglas territory penetrated a far a haddington collected much spoil from country round douglas however came suddenly upon in great force be obliged to retreat hastily across frontier again abandoning baggage booty king invasion be more satisfactory earl of march be unable to place dunbar in hand a scot declined battle in open laid siege to edinburgh without success dunbar being closed to be unable to obtain provision be forced to fall back to england having accomplished nothing during invasion have shown much more leniency than have be custom with predecessor have taken what be necessary to support army have abstained from wasting country destroying village town slaughtering country people so far from embittering animosity between two nation have produced better state of feeling truce be in consequence concluded for year at kelso by special commissioner from king on st of december chapter ludlow castle oswald forster have not be present when in june king arrived at alnwick few day after coming of earl of march hotspur received letter from sir edmund mortimer brother of wife asking to send body of men at arm under experienced captain who must aid to drill newly raised levy for one owen glendower have taken up arm against lord grey de ruthyn that turbulent men be flocking to standard be feared that serious trouble might ensue percy be in position to send few men for with war with scotch imminent must not weaken by sending off large force however sent for alwyn forster need twenty picked men for service of sir edmund mortimer alwyn must send more be not for position of affair here what say to taking command of must gladly do so lord if be that there be chance of something more lively than drilling hind turning into men at arm have be business for year now without chance of striking blow in earnest think that there will be certainty of fighting alwyn welshman be growing troublesome again sir edmund think that there may be tough work on welsh march have written to for aid with king coming there be chance that earl of march will open war by harrying douglas land can spare great force even twenty tried men at arm must doubt be welcome a king be going to march into scotland there be fear that there will be serious invasion by scot therefore can be spared for while think not that of knight must care to go in command of so small array thought that might like to take will be right glad to do so lord will send nephew with be shrewd gallant young fellow know must far rather be taking part in active service against welsh than spending time in idleness here have be too long used to life on horseback to rest contented to be cooped up in castle besides there will be good opportunity of distinguishing of learning something of warfare even wilder more savage than in northern march must like much to have with lord methinks that have making of right good knight young a be be sure that head be better than mine must not be too proud to take counsel of if need be be settled then alwyn choose men set off tomorrow morning ralph peyton lieutenant will take command of garrison until return oswald be delighted when uncle told of mission with be charged that be to accompany be to have choice of men at arm uncle yes oswald know what be going to say must like to have mad monk of yours a one of must uncle have stouter man at arm in band have proved that can be discreet when chooses did good service in last expedition very well lad will take will send one of men over at once for to join on road tomorrow will choose young active fellow of whom have plenty have never fought against welsh be light footed agile country be full of hill swamp older men must do a good service here be castle besieged in absence of however there be slight chance for work against welsh must be of little use hotspur spoke to oswald that evening here be missive to give to sir edmund mortimer have commended to telling that though young there be not one of squire in whom must more implicitly trust that have carried out delicate mission for with rare discretion courage uncle a old retainer good fighter captain of garrison go in command of men at arm in regular fighting one must need better officer in such warfare a against welsh be like to be yours will be better head to plan a squire will represent have specially commended to a one always to be depended upon be greatly beholden to lordship oswald said will try to justify commendation that have given at daybreak on following morning little party rode out from castle oswald with uncle rode in front former in highest spirit while sturdy old soldier be scarce le pleased at change from monotony of life in garrison year seem to have fallen off shoulder lad said feel a young a did when fought at otterburn be bad business uncle trust such misfortune a will befall time hope not indeed oswald be sore fight be scarce likely to have pitched battle with welsh carls fight not much in fashion a have heard dash down from hill carry fire sword through district be off again before force can be gathered to strike blow then there be march to fro among hill be like chasing will o ' wisp like enough just when think have got cooped up prepare to strike heavy blow be hundred mile away plundering ravaging on side of frontier be half wild men short in stature match for when come to hand to hand fighting broad in shoulder tireless active a shaggy pony well nigh a untamable 't be fighting in there be little glory many hard knock to be obtained be good school for war teach man to be ever watchful on guard prepared to meet sudden attack patient under difficulty what be harder to be able to go without eating drinking for long time for say that might a well expect to find corn ale on crest of grampians a must on welsh hill prospect doe look very pleasant uncle oswald laughed however hill can scarcely be more barren than ours can be quicker on stroke than border raider for such work of northern march have proved far more useful than beefy men of south doubt doubt maybe that for reason sir edmund prayed hotspur to send detachment to aid for must know that be accustomed to country a rough to foe a active a have now to meet wonder have stirred up welsh now knowing a do although may gain success at first always end in harrying of land burning of castle village have be quiet for year be always like swarm of bee will work quietly enough till take offence at something then will pour out in fury attacking come across caring nothing about death so that can prick enemy with sting maybe be report that king be engaging in scotch war think that be good time to gather spoil from neighbour used to be mightily given to warring among of late have heard little of be hundred year now since be really troublesome rose under morgan ap madoc edward second have to reduce to submission build strong castle at conway beaumaris other place there have be one two partial rising since then nothing of much consequence may well be that present generation who have not felt power of english arm may have decided to make stroke for independence if so will need more than mortimer force that of other border baron to bring to reason a for little detachment will be drop in ocean however may be that be mere quarrel between mortimer of neighbour have heard somewhat of welshman owen glendower who life in part have grievance against lord grey of ruthyn who a say unjustly seized small estate of know that petitioned parliament for redress that petition be lately refused 't be strange that man must have known enough of english law to have made petition to parliament yes be common man went to england studied at university even lived in inn of court learned law of country then strangely enough became esquire in household of king richard did good service to when court be broken up on richard being dethroned went away to estate in wale since then have not heard of save a to dispute with lord grey petition to parliament thereon men who be at richard court have told that be courteous gentleman of excellent part be said of much learning man might be formidable enemy oswald said if have be robbed by lord grey might well head insurrection to recover estate from noble in course of ride be joined by roger who warmly thanked alwyn for having selected a one of band other soldier received heartily for fighting monk have be familiar personage at alnwick mighty strength jovial disposition rendered very popular among soldier of garrison there have be general satisfaction among when be known that have laid aside monk gown have become one of percy men at arm there have be many expression of regret that have be sent off instead of forming one of garrison of alnwick two three of addressed a usual a monk said look here comrade have be monk bad one le said about better be no longer monk man at arm a be not proud of doings a monk have given up title a have given up garb therefore give fair notice whosoever in future will address a monk will feel weight of arm name be roger a roger let be called henceforth so saying fell into place in line when cavalcade continued way journey be long one oswald have be well supplied with fund seldom found difficulty in obtaining lodging for party sight of esquire with small troop of men at arm wearing percy cognizance excited curiosity a rode south when turned westward be otherwise at halting place oswald uncle who dined apart from others be always questioned a to destination when be known that be travelling to castle of mortimer whose sister be wife of lord none be surprised for rumour be already current of trouble on welsh border when entered shropshire heard that owen glendower with considerable force have fallen suddenly upon retainer of lord grey de ruthyn have killed many have reoccupied estate of have be deprived by nobleman on fifteenth day after leaving alnwick arrived at ludlow castle of mortimer be lord oswald be at once conducted to hall where knight be sitting be bearer of message from sir henry percy said have sent hither party of twenty men at arm under command of captain of garrison at alnwick have hoped for more knight said taking missive opening can understand now king be marching against scotland percy can not spare troop to despatch so long distance trust that sister wife earl be in good health left so sir knight read hotspur letter speaks in term of high commendation of young sir said a laid letter down on table such commendation be rarely bestowed on one so young marvelled somewhat when entered that sir henry percy must have sent so young squire from what say doubt not that choice be good one indeed be plain that muscle have have rare exercise that can stand fatigue hardship better than many older men be like will have share for whole border seems to be unsettled have heard that glendower have boldly attacked driven out lord grey retainer from estate have taken a to right of matter have nought to say lord grey manages affair with welsh in own county of denbighshire along north keep eastern border meddle not with affair with mine know that glendower be supporter of king richard of whom there be many tale current saying that escaped from pomfret be still alive though doubt not that report that died there be true know that there be in scotland man whom plea albany to put forward a richard methinks be device to trouble king whether glendower belief in man not know not certain be that must embrace opportunity to prove hostility to henry whom professes to regard a usurper whether be on account of holding such opinion foolishly giving expression to that lord grey thought fit to seize estate know not indeed do care now however that man have taken up arm by force have dispossessed lord grey matter touch of who be responsible for keeping of peace in welsh march be only quarrel between lord grey man must matter little from hear exercise strange influence over countryman who deem that have mysterious power can call up spirit to aid for have never known instance where necromancy spirit have availed in way against stout arm good armour such be not assuredly opinion of unlearned in country in wale mountaineer be altogether without learning be full of superstition even with man more learned than commonalty be deemed by to dabble in black art may well be that reputation glendower have obtained be altogether due to fact that have much knowledge whereas people have none however may be there be doubt that welsh people be mostly ignorant at call of glendower men from part be hastening to join banner even on side of border there be complaint that welsh servant be leaving not openly after due termination of service making off at night without word of warning must seem to show that there be trouble on hand behoves to be watchful to hold in readiness lest at time must a in day of old cross border carry fire sword through shropshire hereford royal castle in wale must doubtless hold out against attack garrison must have to remain pent up within wall until succour reached fortunately most of be situated near sea must be relieved without troop having to march through place where heavily armed man can scarce make way where active half clad welshman can harass night day without ever giving chance of coming to close quarter messenger from lord grey arrived here yesterday indeed since attack on retainer have be in constant communication at first made light of matter said that must like to have welshman hanging from battlement of castle during last week message have be le hopeful glendower have disappeared from neighbourhood altogether leaving sort of proclamation to lord grey affixed to door of house saying that next time heard of mercy must be shown man must be slain now say that rumour reach of large gathering that there be bonfire nightly on hilltop doubt not that trouble will soon be suppressed admits that much blood may have to be spilt ere be done can bear testimony to bonfire for from top of keep dozen can be seen night blazing among hill of course sir messenger asking lord percy to send body of men at arm here be despatched before glendower attack on lord grey certainly be three month now since parliament refused glendower appeal for justice against lord grey rumour have be busy ever since said that be travelling through valley accompanied by of harper who have always taken leading part in stirring up welsh to insurrection avow that have retired to fortress be there weaving design for overthrow of lord grey even of whole of english castle say that claim to be descendant of llewellyn rightful king of wale there be foundation for for have talked to of better class of welsh who have like glendower studied in university welsh be above thing fond of long pedigree can trace pretend to trace lineage of principal family up to noah of admit that there be ground for claim glendower be said to have made still rumour make feel uneasy a have have many year of quiet here have not be necessary to keep up more than sufficient number of men at arm for defence of castle might have increased force for people of part bear deep animosity against welsh dread greatly a may well do from many wrong outrage have suffered at hand one reason why have not taken on many men since talk of coming trouble began be that close to border a be many have connection with welsh by business marriage if enrolled in garrison might serve a spy give warning of movement might undertake have hoped that percy must have spared hundred good men at arm must rather have have men than others because have be trained in border warfare by constant trouble in scotland must moreover come to with better heart than others since sir henry wife be sister be therefore almost family quarrel upon have entered have known when wrote that king be on way north must have taken step to raise strength elsewhere a of course percy must have occasion to use lance must muster lord grey have sent off messenger to king begging to denounce fellow a outlaw must be troublesome may after have done with scot send hither force for although may hope with aid of levy of border county to drive back welsh in force may come 't be thing to march into mountain matter have be tried again again have always taxed power of england to utmost 't be of use lamenting over spilt milk for part regret that parliament did not give fair hearing to glendower complaint against lord grey refusal to do so be high handed one have driven man to desperation have enlisted sympathy of welshman who have english neighbour for can not say among 'if be to be plundered despoiled complaint refused hearing what be to prevent being similarly despoiled 't be surely better to take up sword at once begin again fight for independence ' a be may cost thousand of life immense effort vast trouble before thing be placed on former footing doubtless captain of men at arm have brought be good soldier since percy say that be captain of garrison at alnwick bear high reputation in northumberland sir edmund may say that be uncle 't be from recommendation that lord percy in first place took into household will go down speak with knight said gave order a soon a heard who have arrived that proper entertainment must be given to yet be right must myself go down to thank for having come so far to welcome captain whose experience will be of small use to own men who have never be engaged in border war have fought in france under condition so different that experience will aid little save indeed if welsh grow so strong so bold that venture to attack castle percy men when knight descended have indeed sat down to supper with retainer of castle while alwyn be being entertained by captain of men at arm rose to foot when sir edmund entered waved hand to to be seated finish meal said afterwards if will muster in courtyard will inspect see what stout northumberland men lord percy have sent then went up to top of keep with oswald pointed out distant hill told what valley village lay among direction in such road a there be ran by time have descended percy men be drawn up in courtyard be uncle captain alwyn forster oswald said of whom lord percy have written to be glad to see so stout soldier here knight said holding out hand to alwyn be grateful to lord percy for sending in answer to request one in whom have such perfect confidence specially thank for having willingly relinquished so important post to head so small following be glad to come sir edmund for have rested so long at alnwick longed for brisk action fell gladly into lord view when requested to come hither can answer for men for be picked by from among stoutest of sir henry following that can well believe knight said a looked at twenty trooper tall strong men a brave a be strong doubt not will be glad to have so stout band to ride behind if welshman break out be accustomed to border warfare differs good deal from in northumberland while northern foray be mostly made by horseman be rare that welshman adventure on horseback be a active a wild pony a swift if trouble increase will give plenty to do learn from lord letter that will be a usual under pay from while be with will pay a much more 't be meet that if render service must see that be comfortable well contented there be murmur of satisfaction among men after recommending to care of captain of garrison bidding alwyn speak in name of men fearlessly for anything must be lacking sir edmund left courtyard seneschal of castle sir john wyncliffe requested oswald to follow first showed chamber in one of turret that be to occupy then took down to hall where two other knight four esquire two three page be assembled in readiness for supper mortimer with wife two daughter presently came down took place at head of table at others sat down in order of rank a guest oswald be placed among knight before sitting down sir edmund presented to wife daughter be one of sir henry percy esquire said can give more news of sir percy wife of whom beyond saying that sends greeting to hotspur tell nothing have be long member of sir henry percy household year lady hotspur speaks of in very high term say that have rendered great service that have highest confidence in to what family do belong sir dame asked from husband sister who be staying here month since learned much of northern family be son of john forster of yardhope who have reputation of being a hard fighter a on border be not knight though of fair estate for although earl percy offered knighthood for service at battle of otterburn said that preferred remaining plain john forster a father have be before mother be daughter of sir walter gillespie uncle be captain of garrison of alnwick be for goodwill towards father that sir henry appointed one of esquire thinking moreover might be more useful than because know foot of border having relation on scottish side of now sat down to supper after be over sir edmund took oswald with to wife bower there said can talk at ease tell how sister mistress be child did not say sir edmund wife asked that be captain of men at arm sir hotspur sent hither in command of band be so dame then surely must have be at table asked sir edmund replied said that must rather with permission lodge with john baldry who be like stout soldier who like better own society than of high table said that except upon rare special occasion always have be accustomed to take meal alone with comrade whom must take to room a be also john baldry habit prayed to allow to accept invitation to share room what say about habit be true lady can well understand uncle care not for company where must not be seemly for to raise voice to enter into hot argument on point of arm be service of sir henry speaks be mission with charged involved danger by way dame mortimer said sister in law wrote to time since telling of strange conflict be held between one of squire who have be newly appointed who on one of mountain pony worsted opponent although latter be much older moreover clad in full armour riding heavy warhorse be who be victor on occasion can scarce be said to have be victor lady be indeed hardly combat maintained that one accustomed to exercise in use among border men mounted on one of pony accustomed to move with great rapidity to turn twist at slightest movement of rider knee must be match for heavy armed knight in single combat although number must have chance against charge of handful of mailed knight sir henry put to proof at once chapter welsh rising for time garrison at castle have little to do lord grey have taken no step to recover estate from retainer have be so unceremoniously ejected have indeed marched strong force through welsh have entirely withdrawn must be necessary to keep so large force unemployed be to reoccupy land that abstained from taking decisive action prior to return of messenger whom have despatched to inform king of forcible measure glendower have taken to recover estate must have be trifling step to take to carry arm into wale so bring on fresh struggle after so many year of peace must not move in matter until have royal authority henry lost time in replying glendower have be open supporter of richard have retired from court rather than own successor a king have made complaint against lord grey before parliament appeal have be rejected by overwhelming majority attack upon lord grey be therefore viewed in light of insult to royal power fortnight after oswald party arrived at sir edmund messenger arrived with royal order to baron holding castle on border to proclaim owen glendower outlaw to take measure necessary to capture sir edmund shook head a read proclamation copy of be to be fixed to castle gate in other conspicuous place lord grey have stirred up fire that will be difficult to extinguish be a wise to kick over hive of bee when naked to waist a to set wale in ferment again have proclamation be sent to only must have taken upon to hold over until have made journey north to see king to submit to view on subject to point out how dire might be consequence to inhabitant of march how great must be effort required if glendower must be supported by whole of countryman a believe will be however a have be sent to keeper of march can not be done will at once send order to sheriff of shropshire hereford to warn militia that may be called out at moment must hold in preparedness having man arm accoutrement in good condition fit for service according to law will also issue order to own tenant to be ready to take up arm to drive herd away bring wife family into castle a soon a beacon fire be lighted on summit of keep be said to oswald to whom sir edmund have taken strong liking to whom spoke more freely than might have done to own knight officer a being in earl percy service having personal interest in matter in debate have heard tale have be brought in to showing how greatly people have be stirred by belief in glendower power of necromancy how blue flame have be seen to issue from window loophole of house how red cloud of various strange shape hover over mysterious sound be heard throughout night for believe not tale though must not take upon to say be false since everyone know that there be men who have dealing with power of darkness still must have to see thing before gave credence to that however make difference in matter true not seem to be believed by welsh can not increase power well will soon hear what reply make to proclamation of will certainly hear within few hour of posting answer indeed be not long in coming for within week copy of reply sent by glendower to king appeared side by side with proclamation put up none knowing who be daring enough to affix in glendower no longer spoke of grievance against lord grey declared that with will of people have assumed sovereignty of wale to be legally entitled by descent from king called upon welshman in england to resort at once to standard die be cast now sir edmund said a read paper affixed to castle gate be no longer question whether glendower be wrongfully treated by lord grey be matter touching safety of realm honour of lord king there be have now learned foundation for owen claim to be representative of king of wale through mother elinor be eldest daughter of elinor red who be daughter heiress of catharine one of daughter of llewellyn last prince of wale for aught know there may be others who have better claim than at least have royal blood in vein at present that matter little have usurped title of king of wale be evidently most ambitious dangerous fellow none can doubt that scheme have not just sprung from brain have long be prepared that quarrel with lord grey have hastened outbreak will myself ride to ruthyn consult with lord grey a to measure to be taken may be that force may be sufficient to crush movement ere gain strength though greatly doubt still must be well that must act in concert sir john burgon sir philip haverstone do take dozen men at arm ride through country bidding tenant assemble here next saturday in arm harness that myself may inspect may tell that third of number must be in readiness tonight must ride hither by morning others must on alarm being given gather in strong house selected by a most defensible in district with wife family so a to repel attack welsh may make leaving behind boy old men to drive out flock herd towards nearest castle to hereford shrewsbury a may be nearest to when knight have left messenger be sent out to owner of castle in radnor hereford shropshire bidding assemble in four day time at ludlow on day of meeting nearly three hundred tenant vassal presented to sir edmund having first inspected arm explained situation then man be asked how many must bring into field in accordance with term of holding be found total amounted to nigh eight hundred men know not when affair be likely to begin will therefore call only for quarter of force send son unmarried men at end of month can return to if need be can send a many more in place may be that will not require possibly man may have to come out must bear in mind be not for defence of town castle that men be required for garrison burgher can hold out against attack to save homestead from destruction news have created deep sensation although none of present have experienced horror of border warfare there be not one have heard from father tale of burning massacre wholesale destruction by welsh foray so long time have passed since last serious insurrection that news that wale might shortly be in arm again came a terrible blow to agreed to send in proportion of men at once to see that rest be ready to assemble immediately summons came next day forty knight owner of castle thickly scattered through border county assembled in ludlow castle there be long consultation arrangement be made for despatch of messenger by nearest to frontier with news of welsh raid point be fixed upon where must assemble with what force must gather thence to march to threatened place to assemble at ludlow castle mortimer being warden of march along line of

assembled in courtyard here after short consultation be determined that mounted party must be at once despatched to endeavour to harass advance of welsh troop consisting of alwyn men at arm twenty men of garrison fifty mounted men who formed part of new levy four hundred footman be to follow at once sir john wyncliffe at first thought of taking command be pointed out to that presence must be required in ludlow to marshal force must speedily arrive from country round sir john burgon therefore valiant knight who have greatly distinguished against french be unanimously chosen by companion a leader of whole party while with rode sir philip haverstone sir william bastow reminds one of one doings at home oswald uncle said a formed up little troop trust welsh will not retreat until have have taste of quality doubt much if will prove a formidable foe a scotch borderer for considerable portion of distance road led through forest at time covered greater part of country oswald at invitation of knight rode with at head of cavalcade way be beguiled by anecdote have be passed down from mouth to mouth of last welsh war reached knighton by nine o'clock enemy have not a yet come within sight of town throughout night sky to west have be red with flame of burning village homestead male inhabitant be under arm many have already sent wife child in waggon towards ludlow a town have strong wall men be determined upon making stout defence crowded round newly arrived troop with loud cheer be raised again again when heard that by midday four hundred footman must arrive to assistance have be arranged that sir philip haverstone must remain in town to take charge of defence that mounted men must under sir john burgon endeavour to check welsh plundering party in open sir william bastow be to remain to assist haverstone in defence of town there be great fear of falling a before day be out four five thousand men must be assembled at ludlow must be able to march to relief matter being arranged sir john burgon led little troop out of town account of welsh force be very conflicting balance of opinion be that there be not le than four five thousand of beyond fact that be skirting hill advancing towards knighton terrified fugitive must say nothing save of own experience be evident however that welsh force be not keeping together after crossing border have broken up scattered over country burning slaying of band have approached to within five mile of town might not improbably come in contact with fresh band of enemy crossing hill near source of severn a soon a have sallied from castle left town behind sir john halted party now men said there be one thing that must remember welshman be not to be despised doubtless will be able to ride over think that when have done so have defeated will throw down on ground leap up a pas over stab horse from below seize leg try to drag from saddle leap up on to crupper behind stab to heart be make so dangerous foe to horseman at crecy did terrible execution among french chivalry therefore be careful wary spit see on ground with lance hold sword ever in readiness to strike down a rise up beside keep in a close order a can for thus will make more difficult for to rise from ground a pas over then formed troop into two line in centre of front line placed twenty men at arm from castle with fifteen of tenant on hand oswald troop formed centre of second line with ten of tenant on flank of knight be in command in line be to ride fifty pace behind first to cut down who rose to foot after first line have passed if resistance be strong first line brought to stand be to ride up reinforce have ridden three mile when saw column of smoke rise mile away pace be quickened have gone short distance when panic stricken men came running down road how many welshman have attacked village sir john asked hundred of sir knight one of men panted out at least so seemed to indeed be side of village when rushed into seeing that nought must be done to resist fled at once when within three hundred yard of village entered open ground at once formed up in order knight have directed oswald took place by side of uncle couple of length in advance of own troop scarce word be spoken in rank here there dead body be scattered over ground showing that pursuit of fugitive have be maintained thus far from village wild shout of triumphant welsh sounded plainly mingled with came occasionally cry of pain seemed to show that work of slaughter be not yet completed that of villager still held one of house be defending until last face be set stern tenant knew that at moment similar scene might be enacted in own village while men at arm be eager to get at foe take vengeance for murder have perpetrated be sure keep rank sir john said remember that who straggle may be attacked by score of wild men slain before others can come to help ride forward in perfect silence till be within striking distance at gallop troop swept down upon village a reached first house saw that road be full of wild figure be emerging from house laden with such spoil a must be gathered there chiefly garment others with torch be setting fire to thatched roof while in middle of village number be attacking house somewhat larger more massively built than rest sir john raised sword with shout of mortimer mortimer shout be re echoed by follower moment later dashed into midst of welsh at first swept before speedily mountaineer running out from house gathered thickly on side of road a first line passed closed in behind running even more swiftly than charging horse strove to leap up behind struck at horse with sword hamstringing several of slaying rider a fell ride ride knight in command of second line shouted at even greater speed than before follower rode hotly forward came ere long on struggling mass for first line be now endeavouring to turn so a to face assailant with great shout second line fell upon war cry of percy percy being mingled with of mortimer approach have be unnoticed by welsh onslaught be irresistible welsh be hurled to ground by impetus of charge two line joined hand forward again sir john shouted troop dashing forward be soon hotly engaged with enemy who be in strong force at point where be attacking house order of commander be now impossible to follow be fierce melee where fought for face round oswald shouted now men lay about percy percy active little horse swung round instantly faced crowd surging up against be style of fighting to border men be accustomed active a welsh be border pony be a quick in movement wheeling turning hither thither keeping ever within short distance of other trooper hewed down foe with heavy sword being partly protected by armour possessed great advantage over opponent oswald uncle fought slightly in advance of others lending helping hand to other when pressure be greatest on one occasion welshman seized alwyn leg while be engaged with foeman on other side strove to throw from horse oswald wheeled pony with sweeping blow rid uncle of foe at same moment man leapt up behind while two others assailed in front welshman sinewy arm prevented from again raising sword must have be slain by in front have not at moment slipped right foot from stirrup thrown from horse leg sweeping off man who held behind hurled to ground beneath welshman grasp instantly relaxed a oswald tried to rise blow fell upon helmet four welshman threw upon threw arm around two of rolled over over with thereby frustrating effort of companion to strike stab through unguarded point in armour when suddenly there be mighty shout two tremendous blow be struck in quick succession then there be shout hold still master oswald hold still oswald tightened grasp on assailant who be now striving to rise there be crashing blow then last opponent slipped from grasp fled thanks roger said a leapt to foot be just in time minute fellow must have got knife into have have eye upon master time while doing little on own account have kept in readiness to come to aid if need be roger be fighting with heavy mace number of men lying round with skull crushed in showed with what terrible effect have be using oswald again leapt on to horse have be too well trained to leave master side have indeed in small degree aided by kicking furiously at welsh a strove to aid comrade on ground by time combat be well nigh over protection afforded by alwyn band against attack on rear have enabled sir john men at arm tenant to clear street in front of welsh though unable to hold own in open fight have now betaken to bow arrow from behind house shot fast door of house have still resisted have be thrown open eight men have come out followed by twenty woman child do of leap up behind one of sir john shouted woman up men then right about ride out of village be getting too hot for here order be quickly obeyed placing horse carrying double burden in centre troop rode out in compact body welsh poured out into road behind level spear alwyn shouted to men who have by order fallen in in rear of others long spear be levelled with shout twenty men rode down on pursuer bursting way through a if have be crowd of lay figure then wheeling returned again none venturing to try to hinder rejoined main body well done indeed sir john burgon exclaimed in knightly fashion verily long border spear of yours be right good weapon when so stoutly used once outside village troop rode quietly on to spot at have first charged then villager dismounted made stout defence men sir john said be well that have time to gain that house be agreed that must take to sir knight one of men said attack be so sudden that only woman have time to reach before be on have not be for arrival must soon have mastered for be bringing up tree to burst in door a none of have time to catch up bow arrow have way of hindering still methinks many must have fallen before forced way in men now fell in again number be counted loss be by far heaviest in front line five of castle men at arm fourteen of levy be killed several others have gash from long knife light ax of welsh five of tenant in second line have fallen none of alwyn band although most of latter have received wound more le serious in combat with welsh loss be heavy sir john said be a nought to inflicted upon welsh did not count a rode back assuredly over hundred have fallen not counting who be slain in last charge of yours alwyn truly men have fought gallantly a be shown by pile of dead where men at arm defended rear welsh will be moving ere long village be already burning may be sure that there be nothing left to sack in other house if come way must fall back for in forest will be match for if move across open country may get opportunity of charging again told two of men to dismount to crawl cautiously along one on side of burning village to bring back news moment welsh began to leave in twenty minute returned saying that enemy be streaming out at other end of village laden with plunder of kind there seemed to be order discipline among trooping along at pleasure good knight said will give lesson time on more favourable term than last troop formed into column galloped at canter through burning village at other end came upon number of straggler who be at once killed then emerged into field beyond formed line plain be dotted with men nearest hundred yard away farthest nearly mile in single line horseman swept along rearmost welshman turned round at tramp of horse at once throwing to ground bundle that carried took to heel with shout of warning a be alarm spread among rest who believing that foe have ridden away through forest be taken completely by surprise panic seized leader in vain shouted order voice be unheard among cry of men indeed gathered together a ran greater portion fled in various direction to escape line of spear vengefully following unable to avoid charge stood at bay like wild animal first shooting arrow drew short ax knife a horseman came within short distance of few have chance of striking most of falling pierced through through by spear who by swiftness of eye escaped fate sprung at horse like wildcat clinging to saddle while strove to bury knife in rider body back piece now served trooper in good stead a did superior personal strength beat assailant down on to pommel of saddle throttled stabbed while in many case where be hard pressed sword of comrade rid from foe so line held on way until reached head of body of fugitive then in obedience to shout of sir john burgon turned broke up into small body scoured plain cutting down flying foe did not draw bridle until what remained of enemy have gained shelter of wood then at sound of leader trumpet gathered around in centre of plain two three have fallen from welsh arrow not few have received ugly slash from knife with exception have come scatheless through fray at least two hundred dead welshman be scattered on plain have done work well men sir john said taught lesson that will not forget now let ride back to knighton see how matter go there on arriving at little town found that be quiet that body of welsh have approached town party of horse be again sent out in various direction smoke serving a guide village be found to be entirely deserted pushing farther on many fugitive came out from hiding place report be of same character welsh be in full retreat for own country by time troop returned with news to knighton footman from ludlow have marched in be being entertained by inhabitant who now that danger have passed have returned retired have sir john two fellow knight said a arrived with following be raid for plunder then not invasion doubtless glendower merely wished to warm blood to engage so far in enterprise that must no longer draw back must have carried off hundred of cattle sheep to say nothing of other plunder have not be for having news soon enough to get here before retired must have got off scatheless a be have learned that even well planned foray can not be carried out with impunity loss of three hundred life will not affect greatly when be clear that have murdered twice number a well a enriched with plunder think not that will hear of again sir john said glendower have shown without doubt what be intention may now wait to see what come of last night work expect that will keep among hill where can fight to better advantage for horseman be of little use where there be mountain forest after consultation between knight be agreed that two hundred of footman be to remain for two three day at knighton in case retreat of welsh might be feigned one intended to lull inhabitant into state of security then to make sudden night attack upon wall whole force remained until next morning then leaving sir philip haverstone in command of party remaining at rest horse foot marched back to ludlow band have indeed distinguished oswald sir john have said on previous evening a talked on event of day truly be a stout men a have ever seen fighting have escaped without wound though marked that armour clothes be covered with mire a if have be rolling in road be just what have be doing sir john one of leaped on to horse behind pinioned arm while two three others made at with ax stave clasp of fellow be like iron band seeing that only chance be to rid of slung leg over horse came down together undermost whether fall killed not can not say arm relaxed dozen sprang on in minute must have be killed have not that big trooper of mine come to aid with mighty mace dashed out brain well nigh before knew that be attacked stout fellow indeed sir john said one must like to have to ride behind on day of battle have marked before thought that have never seen more stalwart knave though methinks that must look better did not crop hair so wondrously short oswald laughed doe not to beautify sir john to hide fact that hair on crown be of six week growth then related circumstance under roger came to be member of troop by faith have done well sir john said man with such sinew a be lost in cloister be merry fellow too have often marked at castle laugh be veritable roar must sound strange echoing along gallery of monastery abbot did well to let go for fellow might well disturb peace quiet of whole convent say that have skill in war yes sir john have be instructor in arm of lay brother of of monk too led contingent of abbey at otterburn although day went against english follower greatly distinguished if must part with must better condition master oswald for on recommendation sir edmund must be sure make captain of company must be sorry indeed to part with sir john more so since have saved life today even be willing feel sure must not leave a have gone through adventure together belief that be to that owes escape from convent be adventure oswald be matter touching earl of march not sir edmund nephew now in care of king scottish earl george earl of dunbar also bearing title of earl of march now that have taken oath to king henry there be reason why must not speak of then gave account of visit to dunbar of escape why did earl wish to keep maybe sir that have not then made up mind thought that affair might yet have be accommodated between douglas scottish king perhaps be so sir john agreed be crafty a well a bold man however be well out of dunbar monk managed affair well think that earl be to be trusted must say so great scottish noble deem well nigh king equal carry on war against other a independent lord castle of dunbar be in hand of bitterest enemy douglas will come into small portion of estate without aid of england must not hope to recover interest therefore be wholly bound up with ours 't be strange that there must be two earl of march of different family name now dunbar have become vassal of king will make matter stranger however at present mistake can arise seeing that one be able warrior other mere boy in future be two earl of march at same time at court of king mistake might well be made strange complication take place doubtless be aware that sir edmund nephew be by right of birth king of england be know sprung from duke of clarence elder brother of duke of lancaster duke died without male issue right fell to edmund mortimer earl of march husband of daughter philippa from marriage be born roger mortimer who be lord lieutenant of ireland during part of king richard reign be killed in war of country left two son of whom elder be eight nine year old when richard be dethroned brother be now living at windsor be well treated there by king have lord nephew attained age of manhood at deposition of richard many must doubtless have supported right to throne for child of eight to rule realm keep in check turbulence of great lord must be so absurd that one even mentioned name henry of course ascended throne a if by right of conquest have heard something of before sir john a percy be among chief supporter of henry fact that there be one who have greater right to throne be never talked of at alnwick although by percy marriage with sir edmund sister became uncle of young earl of march can understand indeed sir edmund have never in most intimate conversation with expressed opinion that young earl must if have right be king of england chapter breach of duty two three hour after return of force to ludlow sir edmund mortimer returned having ridden almost without halt since be received news of welsh incursion knight met in courtyard well friend hear have sent welsh back again a fast a came can not say that sir edmund sir john wyncliffe replied sir john burgon went out with ninety horse coming upon party of five six hundred of killed number put rest to flight main body left of own free will without urging 't be pity that be so hurried for in twenty four hour must have have four thousand men on march against besides who first went on have done much damage there be house left standing between hill on side of llanidloes knighton from what can gather must have slain three four hundred at least at first total be put much higher a soon a retired many fugitive made way into knighton having slipped away in darkness when village be attacked concealed in wood among rock there have be fighting up in north too sir edmund said when got to ruthyn found that lord grey be away talked over matter with knight be to have left on morning of fifth day after leaving here at night glendower men raided almost up to gate of castle plan be well laid for just at midnight alarm be given by sentry on wall everyone ran to arm instant warder horn be sounded when reached top of wall fire be bursting out in twenty place be not long before knight rode out with hundred fifty men at arm welsh be already gone seems that have laid ambuscade round village on signal being given fell at once upon sleeping inhabitant put to sword fired house in ten minute from first alarm made off driving horse cattle sheep before be with party rode hard fast came up with none of party must have gone own way striking off into hill a soon a returned to castle started with four men at arm have lost time on road especially after rumour reached that there have be welsh raid here also now sir john burgon will give account of doings of party knight reported proceeding after leaving ludlow concluded be like that story must not have so run sir edmund have not be for bravery shown by northern men under young squire oswald captain alwyn so furiously did welsh assail in rear that must have suffered heavily indeed even if have not met with grave disaster have not be that band covered rear while charged forward fighting so stoutly that spot where posted be thickly covered with dead found time to look round now then for made poor resistance to advance never did see stronger fighting have questioned men say that none fought more bravely than young oswald uncle give warm praise lad however must have lost life have not be for stout fellow who stand head above comrade be very giant in strength oswald told how came about repeated account of incident be quick thought to throw fellow who held off horse though must not have availed much have not stout man at arm be at hand still in case must have defended single handed against five of knave though doubtless must have given good account of of have not arm be held alwyn said that three time during fray young esquire saved life by cutting down men who be attacking from behind while be occupied by other opponent in front will make valiant knight day sir john sir henry percy must not have written so strongly about have not good reason for feeling that must not do discredit to recommendation well sir knight have merited thanks for manner in have discharged duty during absence of course be perfectly right wyncliffe in remaining here until at rate knight brought in following from country round be important to save knighton vastly more so to prevent overspreading whole country might for aught can tell have be glendower object be a well that haverstone bastow must have remained at knighton now a have not broken fast have ridden since midnight without stop will breakfast can then talk over plan to be pursued for there be disguising fact that welsh be up in arm that have long heavy work before however be matter too serious for to undertake by ourselves be for king to take in hand raid can be punished by counter raid now glendower have declared sovereign of wale that everything point to fact that men of nation be ready to support be matter touch majesty very closely doubt not that a soon a have finished war with scot will march hither at head of army however will send out summons to tenant of nephew estate in herefordshire order to hold in readiness must glendower venture to invade think not that will do so know that county bristle with castle in people must find refuge that if undertook to besiege must speedily lose best part of army none of people have experience of war to besiege strong place need machine of kind of glendower have none be likely that can construct besides while marching out must be exposed to attack by garrison of castle sallying out in rear therefore think not that will be foolish enough to undertake great enterprise though may make raid carry off booty cattle a have now done moreover can not keep vassal in field longer than feudal obligation compel to stay unless pay feed might be done readily enough for two three month war may last for year must reserve mean strength till be urgently needed lord grey will doubtless be of opinion be sure to do what can to capture glendower a will consider not only a enemy of king a personal foe however powerful a be think not that will venture alone to lead army into welsh hill until receives assistance from king two day later news came that king a soon a heard of glendower proclamation have sent order to lord grey lord talbot to punish will reach chester two day hence sir edmund said after raid made here must gladly take small share in punishing rebel sir john burgon have have full share of honour by defeat of other day therefore will send sir william bastow do sir william take thirty of best mounted men of garrison together with lord percy troop ride to chester will give letter to lord talbot saying that being anxious to aid in punishment of rebel who have just raided march have sent in haste with fifty stout men to aid in striking blow if possible in effecting glendower capture before can do further harm to king loyal subject hour later troop mounted oswald be in high spirit for sir edmund have spoken few word to when telling of service to have appointed be sending troop with sir william bastow said chiefly in order may give opportunity of distinguishing also because be sure that percy must be glad that men must take part in enterprise in there may be honour credit lastly because must that party must do credit fighting other day showed that follower better understand warfare of kind than do mine troop arrived at chester second day after leaving rested horse for twenty four hour on arrival of earl of talbot lord grey sir william bastow called at inn where put up delivered letter from sir edmund mortimer 't be well done of sir edmund earl of talbot said although ruthyn lie beyond government of march be defending own command by aiding lord grey against presumptuous traitor will gladly take clump of spear with among whom be see small party of lord percy men at arm hear that sir edmund men inflicted sharp blow upon welsh near knighton met messenger bearing report to king a came along gave particular from seems that fight be for time hard one that welshman fought a used to do with much bravery did lord be not with party defeated having be left at knighton to aid in defence there must welsh attack town sir john burgon who commanded said that in village fought a if cared not for life though made scarce defence when fell upon a retired in disorder success gained attribute in small degree to percy little troop led by captain stout soldier who command garrison of alnwick by young squire of sir henry percy who though lad fought with extreme bravery be with now sir henry place great trust in wrote most warmly concerning to sir edmund mortimer be just going to supper earl said hope that will join pray tell where young squire be lodging may send for at once a must fain learn from lip closer account of fighting may be of utility to in adventure oswald arrived just a supper be brought in be introduced to earl lord grey by sir william bastow sit down with young sir earl said kindly be esquire hear of good friend sir henry percy a eat pray tell about fight with welsh sir edmund be not in command hear lord be away at time having ridden to ruthyn to hold council with lord grey ah have not heard that have be there earl grey said arrived day before welsh raid on estate sir finding that be absent intended to return home next morning matter delayed for day a rode out with knight to punish marauder who however made off before must be overtaken when see pray give thanks for so doing now tell happened sir william bastow can better inform sir of what took place until rode away from knighton where remained with sir philip haverstone to take command of townspeople in case welsh must arrive before strong aid must come sir william then related measure have be decided upon step taken to call out levy how brother knight have ridden to knighton with intent to hinder a far a possible welsh advance until footman must reach town to be followed shortly afterwards by troop must come in from castle of radnor oswald then continued story gave account of fight in village manner in welsh be attacked while retiring with booty completely routed tactic have in nowise changed then earl said since day of griffith llewellyn against direct charge be unable to stand attacked with fury whenever there be opportunity of fighting under circumstance when weight discipline gave little advantage hear from sir william bastow that little band covered rear of sir john burgon troop succeeded in keeping at bay until have broken resistance in front carried off small party of villager who be still defending be so lord men be accustomed to border warfare have for most part before entering percy service be often engaged in border foray have taken to soldiering after own home have be burnt cattle driven off by scottish raider therefore be accustomed to fight for instead of in close order horse too bred on moor be far more active nimble than be heavier horse of south enter heart soul into fray kicking plunging striking with foreleg at who approach to assail rider thus be that be able to hold welsh carles at bay far better than men otherwise trained mounted must have be thing be that in border conflict man be accustomed to keep eye on neighbour if see hard pressed to give aid therefore be not surprising that while men slew many of welsh escaped with few cut from blow hatchet be unhorsed sir william tell be in great peril how did come about unhorsing sir rescue be result of what just said habit of keeping eye on neighbour welshman be on point of attacking captain alwyn when be engaged with two others in front struck man down a did so welshman sprang on to horse behind pinned arm to side while four others rushed at then related how have thrown assailant off horse have be saved by roger be good device quickly carried into effect earl talbot said though be well that man at arm next to be watching just a have watched captain else must have gone hard with be evident that if continue a have begun will turn out right valiant knight narrative be useful see that when fall in with welsh will be necessary to have picked body of men at arm whose duty will be to cover rear of main attack for seems that be real point of danger must come into conflict with will assign to body of men at arm who with percy men will under command fulfil duty must at once be of signal benefit to will give opportunity of distinguishing winning spur when time come thank greatly lord trust may so bear a to merit approbation next morning force mounted at daybreak consisted of two hundred horse that earl have brought with be to be joined at chirk by hundred fifty of lord grey men from ruthyn order having be already sent on for to hold in readiness be to be done quietly without stir a word must be sure to be sent to glendower be to be known in town that preparation have be made for expedition be to start from castle at ten o'clock at night when town must be wrapped in sleep must arrive at chirk before daybreak on arriving at castle be found that troop from ruthyn have duly come in be received by seneschal of william beauchamp lord of abergavenny chirk castle have passed through many hand having be several time granted to royal favourite being fine building standing on lofty eminence afforded view of le than seventeen county be square massive with five flanking tower vast strength be calculated to defy utmost effort of welsh to capture be short distance thence to valley of dee in be estate of glendower extending for eight mile north into what be now neighbourhood of llangollen a one of detachment have arrived before daybreak other two hour after dark be improbable that advent have be noticed at request of knight who commanded troop from ruthyn gate of castle have be kept closed day one being allowed to enter leave at daybreak next morning whole force sallied out three quarter of hour later dashed down into valley at point about mile distant from glendower dwelling be very large stately building near stood guest house church appurtenance of man of high rank be called sycharth here glendower maintained almost princely hospitality for in addition to estate possessed others in south wale more especially bard be welcomed here resided for month others who simply paused on ramble through country remained for few day be received with marked honour by glendower who be well aware of important service that must render indeed be on that relied to small extent to arouse feeling of populace hospitality be well repaid by song sung in hall cottage in praise by prophecy that be destined to restore ancient glory of country house be surrounded by moat wall have otherwise no defensive work a for hundred year english welsh have dwelt peaceably side by side many of castle be indeed held by welshman there be few garrison have considerable proportion of welsh in rank be singular that glendower must after defiance of king raid have lately be made have continued to dwell in spot so open to attack within striking distance of three great castle of ruthyn chirk holt certain be that kept garrison must suffice to offer stout defence against strong band although precaution be taken of keeping watchman night day in one of turret sound of horn be heard by horseman a soon a began to descend hill pest on knave lord grey exclaimed will slip through finger yet be scarce minute later when mounted man be seen to dash out at full speed from other side of building be evidently well mounted although pursuit be hotly kept up for two mile gained forest while be still quarter of mile behind be lost to view for although beat wood for distance must find trace of when passing by house detachment of hundred men be ordered to surround to suffer none to enter leave on return of pursuing party house be entered ransacked from end to end male retainer found in be ruthlessly killed furniture showed at once good taste wealth of owner be smashed into piece hanging torn down whole place dismantled only two female attendant be found be suffered by earl talbot order to go free be evidently lady bower when happen to be here lord grey said a hour later entered room in one of turret have be already plundered by soldier 't be pity that did not find one two of glendower daughter here must have be invaluable a hostage be too hasty talbot must have closely questioned of men two woman must have found mean to learn whether be staying here may be that be so that be even now concealed in secret hiding place hard by at once called up several of men set to search room in turret for sign of entrance to secret chamber although wall be tapped floor examined stone by stone clue be found to entrance if existed house be built entirely of stone offered facility for destroying by fire door be hewn down gate in wall taken off hinge thrown into moat being too massive to be destroyed by arm of soldier outlying building be burned down vineyard rooted up water turned out of fish pond then greatly vexed at failure to seize glendower two noble rode back to chirk leaving hundred men of whom band from ludlow formed part under two of earl talbot knight to retain possession of house until must be decided whether must be levelled stone by stone left standing to go with estate to whomsoever king might assign by lord grey advice sentry be posted outside wall from nightfall till daybreak to prevent risk of surprise by glendower whose spy might take word that main body of assailant have left one of great hall have be left untouched to serve for use of garrison a abundance of victual be found in house cellar be well stocked with wine be short time before garrison made thoroughly comfortable a soon a became dark twenty men be placed on watch oswald with party be to take third watch at midnight mortimer men at arm second captain of band be to place men at such point a might select alwyn talked matter over with nephew seems to former said that there be small chance of anyone trying to leave castle at rate if did so must scarcely be over wall for splash in moat must at once betray moreover love not killing in cold blood must poor fellow be stowed away somewhere must be willing enough to let go free agree with altogether alwyn oswald who have not heard talk between grey talbot concerning glendower daughter replied heartily must have gladly saved men who be killed today be one thing to slay in battle to slaughter unresisting men go altogether against grain then a be agreed on oswald must say that have best place greater portion of men well away from wall can leave two at gate set two others to march round round moat must say have best plant others in pair quarter of mile round house be vastly more important to prevent glendower from recapturing house by surprise than be to take prisoner two three fellow making escape agree with alwyn accordingly when filed out from gate four be posted a alwyn have suggested rest be disposed in pair in circle at distance round house will keep watch with roger oswald said 't be time since have have opportunity for talk with will take next post if like wood come closer to house there than at other point there be patch behind enemy might creep up eye ear be good a for roger if lift that mighty voice of in tone of alarm will reach ear of others be signal for to run back to gate at top of speed very well oswald will walk round ground see that be vigilant know not where glendower men be lying may hap be twenty mile away even so must have have plenty of time to have brought up by now think there be much chance of of men being surprised most of having in time be so used to midnight ride across moor hill so accustomed to see in dark crafty a welshman may be think there be chance of getting within hundred yard of of post without being seen especially a moon be still half full do think that there be chance of being disturbed master oswald roger said a took up post under low stunted tree think so if glendower spy have told that main body of who surprised morning have returned to chirk may be sure that enough have be left to hold place successfully against wild follower till assistance can reach must have nothing to gain by recapturing house for must not hold long against force assembled at chirk besides must know well enough that if be to fight successfully must be in wood whether have studied black art there be little doubt that have turned attention greatly to military matter that be foe who be not to be despised be playing deep game will give deal of trouble unless be greatly mistaken before have done with hear sort of strange story of power master oswald yes see roger spirit who a say serve can not be of much use must have warned of coming of talbot must not have taken unawares morning be true enough roger said in tone of relief for part be not greatly alarmed at spirit good abbot used to threaten must be carried off by unless mended way always slept soundly enough never saw aught to frighten used to say that spirit of of dead monk used to walk in convent garden though cell looked down upon have often stood there by hour never did see anything to frighten if welsh do come what be to do master fight by mean roger duty be to watch not to fight must lift up voice shout a loud a can then must run to gate there can make fight till rest join do shout until tell false alarm must raise whole garrison if naught came of must make laughing stock while be talking be keeping close lookout on ground in front of also to right left for watch be two hundred yard apart have to make sure that party of enemy slipped unseen between suddenly roger plucked oswald sleeve said in whisper unless eye deceive master saw two dark figure flit from clump of bush forty yard away to next to there go again see roger may be that be spy who have crept up close let give chase to will shout master be not attack stoop a low a can if look back will see that great figure of yours be off like hare run a softly a can stooping low set off at run being certain that figure be making straight for forest did not pause to get glimpse of ran straight on have gone seventy eighty yard when heard stifled exclamation then without further attempt at concealment two figure rose from bush twenty yard ahead fled for forest there be more occasion for stooping at top of

indeed two fairer maiden have never seen order be to look after welshman see that did not attack word be said of welsh woman besides be running away not thinking of attacking be very well roger can not deceive there be doubt that be duty to take two maiden prisoner heart ache at thought that might pas year of life in prison be not responsible for father misdeed ambition may be that if be restored glendower may be induced to treat who fall into hand mercifully none know of one need ever know will risk anyhow said after short pause know that be not doing duty in letting go be ever known must lose chance of further advancement if indeed did not lose life however need never be known conscience must sorely trouble whenever thought of shut up in one of king henry prison turned to girl again think lady asked that be in king hand father must make term submit certainly not one who have spoken before said have other child son daughter must not dream of abandoning right betraying country to obtain liberty of two of in case then imprisonment must in degree stop war bring about renewal of peace between two country certainly not a for must strangle in prison did think that thought of must turn father from noble purpose then in case oswald said quietly be clear that captivity must do nought to bring about peace to allay trouble have now begun therefore will take on to let go though in so doing may be failing somewhat in duty only promise that in future will use what influence may posse with father to obtain kind treatment for prisoner who may fall into hand expression of haughty defiance that have hitherto worn faded from girl face will never forget kindness sir one said in low voice thank with heart not so much for own sake a for father have be cruelly ill used have much to trouble although know that captivity must not turn from purpose must not greatly grieve trouble have already trouble enough on shoulder will accept one of jewel a token only of gratitude for kindness shown night to thanks lady gift will take be failing in duty at least will not be said that received aught for doing so then at least girl began turning to roger lady man at arm

sister must ask boon of success in war be not always on one side sister will think often of one who have so greatly befriended be by accident of war to fall into welsh hand must evil befall must be deep grief to pray then sir to accept little gold necklet value be small indeed be given to when child by father name be engraved on clasp must at time of stress send to father right sure be that on recognizing must treat a dear friend who have done so much for daughter pray to accept to wear always round neck wrist if must never prove useful to will at least recall to thought can not be so

news have be strange adventure roger very strange one master lord grey must tear hair if knew that two pretty bird have be hiding in cage day never knew however see not that can do harm nay more there be probability that may even benefit for if must happen by ill fortune must ever fall into hand of welsh must abstain from cutting throat then there perchance young lady must repay service have rendered by taking under protection may be so indeed roger though hope that will never hear more of tonight adventure may reason a will there be doubt that although have instruction touching capture of woman have failed in duty will in way trouble master oswald when be monk failed in duty score of time be whit worse for rather better indeed since be owing to failure that be now free man at arm instead of being mewed up for life in convent will not sleep one wink le for having saved two of prettiest girl ever saw from having be shut up for year in prison be afraid sense of duty be not strong roger be afraid not master saving in matter of doing duty in face of enemy mean roger that will do duty when so plea not otherwise expect be way with good many of roger laughed wonder whether lord grey have idea that glendower daughter be in house when arrived there know not remember now that have men searching for time for sign of secret passage whether be from idea that glendower daughter might be hidden away know not truly might have be roger said for saw among spoil be carried off when others rode for chirk silk stuff looked like feminine garment there be somebody coming across from next post broke off doubtless be captain must not tell what have done certainly not roger uncle be old soldier though must not for sake say anything about think not that must approve of have be done be best at rate to keep entirely to ourselves quiet here a elsewhere alwyn asked a came up quiet uncle 't be well for although methinks that must hold place against welshman must hardly hope that of post must not be cut off before must reach house be well to keep watch more think of more feel that glendower will scarce attack must not hold place did gain might well be that after be turned out again place must be destroyed seeing that must need two three hundred men to be shut up here in garrison after waiting hour alwyn again made round of post then went in to rouse party be to relieve a soon a issued out sentry be called in stretched for three hour sleep before day dawned messenger rode in from chirk bearing earl talbot order for evacuation of house a there must be advantage in retaining be empty glendower might return there afford opportunity for capturing on following day party broke up lord grey rode with men to ruthyn forty men at arm from ludlow returned to town where few day later news arrived that glendower with large following have established on rugged height of corwen be engaged in strengthening ancient fortification on summit for time there be quiet on border then came startling news glendower have suddenly surprised plundered burnt to ground town of ruthyn where fair be being held at time then having obtained great booty greatly injured enemy lord grey again retired be evident that local force of sufficient strength must be found to pursue glendower into fastness on range of berwyn snowdon nothing be done until three month later king on return from scotland marched into wale with levy of warwickshire leicestershire eight other adjacent county while order be issued to people of shrewsbury other town on eastern border to hold in readiness to repel

across border to join still for month operation be undertaken on side week after return of king force sir edmund mortimer said to oswald will no longer keep following from lord side have largely strengthened garrison twenty men however valiant be longer of importance a know must not have asked percy to aid have not thought that perchance might have come bringing with two three hundred men that sister might have accompanied maybe if matter go on quietly on northern march may be able to do so yet fear that scotch will take advantage of trouble here may for aught know have entered into communication with glendower so that may together harass kingdom have written several time to telling what good service men have rendered must have five hundred such good fighter with in case must

must be formidable opponent indeed a be be quite unable to stand against men at arm in set battle in respect be by mean equal to scotch for surprise irregular fighting must wish to see better men be unfortunate affair percy said seemed that have finished with wale at llewellyn death that two nation have become one in london many other place be settled among number of studied at university in shropshire radnor flint other border county have heard that most of labouring men be welsh have come to speak language indeed form small portion of garrison of castle so much so that fear must welsh really ravage border county be like not few of castle will fall into hand by treachery of fellow countryman in garrison sir edmund speaks very highly of oswald not only for behaviour in fight be reported to by sir james burgon knight well fitted to judge in such matter a inmate of castle said that from conversation have conceived high opinion of at present thing be somewhat quiet here be well that must like uncle take holiday for time visit father mother have sent over several time for news of next morning oswald mounted rode off attended by roger who have asked oswald to take with a have relation cared to visit alwyn be going for few day only indeed must probably have declined to take holiday at have not oswald earnestly begged to go with 't be two year since have be there oswald said

if have not seen shaken hand when have opportunity such a present oswald have seen so much during two year have passed since first left hold that a rode towards seemed strange that everything must be going on a if be day before that have ridden away only difference being that hold looked strangely small of little account after many strong castle have seen a soon a reached moor within sight of hold horseman be seen to leave ride at gallop towards be ever way oswald said like to know when visitor be seen whether come a friend foe a moss trooper rode up be about to put customary question recognized oswald wheeling pony without word dashed off at full gallop waving spear shouting a approached hold rode at canter after a reached entrance father mother appeared at door at top of step latter ran down step a oswald leapt from horse threw arm round neck thank god be back again boy cried though a yet can hardly believe that tall fellow be oswald otherwise be in way changed think mother that be looking better than when saw last be well dear said have have quiet year cause for anxiety thing have gone well with have be pleasant indeed for to have received such good news of doings to know that stood so well with hotspur oswald now ran up step to greet father who be already talking with alwyn who have slipped off horse run to speak to brother while oswald be occupied with mother well lad john forster said laying hand upon shoulder looking up down have grown well nigh into manhood always said that must over top though methinks have still three inch of advantage have yet time to grow up to look down on well have done credit to boy monkish reading writing have not harmed a be afraid must alwyn tell that man of percy troop did better than in fight with welsh save mayhap big man at arm down there who tell cracked skull of four welshman who be trying to stab besides disposed of on own account owe life indeed father be man after own heart strong brave hearty even jovial when occasion offer can troll out border lay with best can yet read write a well a abbot name be roger come up roger john forster shouted give grip of hand have saved son life a tell so long a live there will be nook by fire here hearty welcome when be tired of soldiering in truth be mighty man went on after roger have exchanged grip must have well nigh broken bone of ordinary man have be looked upon a one able to strike a hard blow a on border assuredly must strike heavier one why man must be five six inch bigger round chest than be have be active man from youth roger replied ever on horseback about while spent year with nought to do eat drink build up frame in monastery oswald told in letter that have be monk have with consent of abbot unfrocked be so roger replied with laugh methinks that be happy day for abbot a well a for myself when laid aside gown for fear gave more trouble than rest of convent besides be a if wolf cub have be brought up among litter of lady lapdog be sure to be ill time for for how long be at home with brother alwyn john forster asked presently be here for week only john oswald have leave for month seeing that at present there be great chance of hotspur needing service scotch be quiet since king returned hear ay be a quiet a be nature to be 't be not likely to last long went not with army hear that henry behaved so gently that scotch feel that must be almost act of ingratitude to meddle with for time however will not last long next spring will doubtless be storming down over hill again holiday passed delightfully to oswald roger enjoyed even more be so long since latter have be permitted freedom of riding at will over mountain moor that be like schoolboy enjoying altogether unwonted holiday oswald scoured country sometimes returning late in afternoon often staying for night at house of one other of oswald friend once crossed border rode to armstrong where stopped for couple of day bringing allan janet back with for roxburgh be still held by english unless when hostility be actively going on people of border save marauder who be always ready to seize opportunity offered of carrying off booty be on friendly term maintained frequent intercourse with other alwyn have returned to alnwick when leave be up have spent time quietly at hold brother have discussed many plan by defence must be strengthened arrived at same conclusion that must defend at present against small party must yield however much defence be increased at approach of invading army since even with assistance of inhabitant of surrounding district must not maintain until army be gathered invader driven out occasionally afternoon be devoted to sport on moor on one occasion john forster sent messenger down to yardhope other village on coquet to hold of neighbour inviting to come to gathering at there must be prize for riding wrestling running shooting feat of arm on horseback foot at comer must be entertained result be gathering such a have not taken place in part of country for year over thousand people assembled comprising woman a well a men sport began early various event be eagerly contested ralph gray won horse race horse have brought from south being far superior in speed to of smaller border horse although have trial be for endurance must have have small chance with shooting be close one of percy hope men winning at last quarterstaff prize be awarded to long hackett one of john forster retainer at wrestling roger bore off palm of opponent be in opinion of looker on more skilled at sport weight strength more than counterbalanced one after tried in vain to throw to ground succumbing a soon a put out strength began to be exhausted when drawing up to with irresistible strength laid quietly on ground oswald carried off palm in mile foot race at one o'clock sport be concluded while have be going on score of men be attending to great joint roasting over bonfire six bullock having be slaughtered day before duck goose chicken innumerable be also cooking while for table in hold at principal guest sat down be trout game venison pasty here wine be provided while outside long row of barrel of beer be broached for commonalty dinner over there be singing dancing alwyn have engaged sent from alnwick score of musician be divided into five party stationed at little distance apart round younger portion of gathering soon grouped while elder listened to border lay sung by wandering minstrel day be shortening fast a many of present have twenty mile to ride by six o'clock amusement came to end gathering scattered in direction delighted with day proceeding although must have be thought of small account in southern county be rare indeed in district so thinly populated so frequently engaged in turmoil strife except in running match oswald have engaged in none of contest being fully occupied in aiding mother in welcoming guest seeing to comfort while father assisted by friend hope gray liddel superintended arrangement for sport acted a judge in afternoon oswald cousin have joined heartily in dance enjoyed day to full a much a visitor gathering of kind be not uncommon shooting wrestling sword playing for men dancing on green for young people took place at most of village fair gathering at yardhope be long talked about a special occasion from hospitality in be included number of head of border family who be present took part in proceeding oswald mother have be prime mover in matter be proud of son thought that be good occasion to present to countryside a one who be now arriving at manhood be likely in time to make figure on border john forster have at first declared that be wholly unnecessary such thing have never taken place in time in father before may be husband said have be away from for two year may be a much more before return be like to become knight before long alwyn said that lad be sure to win spur must be well that must not slip out of memory of folk here besides have cousin be well that must carry back news that in spite of troublous time can yet be merry on suitable occasion cost will not be very great meat can scarcely be counted seeing that have a many cattle on moor a can pick up living there moreover neighbour gave helping hand to repair hold after be sacked last year 't be right that must hold sort of gathering will do for two purpose last argument have more weight with john forster than former one once having consented took a much interest in a did wife dug up pot in stowed away sum remained at end of year over above expense of hold provided be required without stinting three day after gathering armstrong returned home oswald rode with roger to alnwick next three month passed quietly uneventfully snow be lying deep on cheviot until spring there be little chance of scotch making foray oswald worked hard in hall where knight kept in exercise practised with young squire superintended drilling practice of men at arm of whom number at castle have be much increased for none doubted that in spring scot must after henry invasion pay return visit to england that northern county must need very strong force to hold in check be several time sent by percy with message to governor of roxburgh jedburgh to other commander calling upon to be vigilant to send in list of arm store required so that must be in good order to make stout resistance when need came when have received special order to return with speed to alnwick oswald generally found time to pay visit of few hour to armstrong on excursion roger man at arm always rode with for must not have be becoming for squire messenger of hotspur to ride without such escort alwyn have picked out for roger use one of strongest horse in castle be not showy animal having big ugly head being vicious in temper therefore after trial have be handed over to men at arm instead of being retained for service of knight have at first tried best to establish mastership over trooper soon found that effort be a nothing against strength of rider that might a well try to shake off saddle a to rid of trooper grip of whose knee almost stopped breathing oswald too be very well mounted sir edmund mortimer having presented with one of best horse in stable upon leaving upon nearing hiniltie one day just a new year have begun oswald be alarmed at seeing smoke wreath ascending from knoll behind village upon armstrong hold stood galloping on soon saw that first impression be correct that uncle tower be on fire found village in confusion what have happened asked reining in horse for moment hold be suddenly attacked two hour ago man said party of reivers rode through here none have seen coming there be time for to take woman child hurry to shelter of hold adam armstrong be away at roxburgh young allan with what few men there be at hold have just time to shut gate be hewed down in short time by trooper there be stout fight a entered allan be cut down left for dead trooper be killed dame armstrong be slain daughter carried off by reivers a soon a have sacked house set alight galloped off most of men here be away in field with flock in valley be too few to hinder must shut up in house until have gone oswald have dropped rein in speechless dismay be terrible said at last aunt killed janet jessie carried away allan wounded perhaps to death whence came villain asked suddenly from beyond cheviot can hardly be so for part be under governor of roxburgh english raider must dare to meddle with here besides uncle have always be on good term with holding aloof from quarrel having friend relation on side of border believe that be bairds man said there have long be standing quarrel between armstrong partly about stolen cattle more methinks because of relationship between armstrong people for oswald visit to uncle have made face familiar to villager say that bairds have sworn that will never rest until have slain last of forsters where be allan armstrong have carried down to last house in village priest meg margetson who know more of wound simple than anyone here be with have mother body be recovered man shook head hold be on fire from roof to cellar before left said others ran up there directly have galloped away house be like furnace indeed knew not of death until boy who have seen slain have dropped from window hidden till have gone came out told two three others be only one left alive of in hold when arrived saved young allan indeed whether life now not know not priest said when carried in state be almost beyond hope oswald galloped on to end of village leapt from horse threw rein to roger who have be muttering word that certainly must not have found in missal book of monastery be there nothing to be done master oswald not at present must wait till uncle return then entered house have met priest frequently during stay with armstrong a entered room be standing by pallet on allan be laid while very old woman be attending to decoction be boiling over fire be there hope father know not priest replied shaking head sorrowfully have stanched wound head be well nigh cleft open have skill in wound for be common enough in unfortunate country must say that there be hope meg here who be noted through country round for knowledge in matter think that be possible may yet recover be now making poultice of herb that will lay on wound rather on wound for have le than four think that will live young master old woman said in quavering high pitched voice 't be hard to kill armstrong have ever be hardy race save lad father have ever be prone to giving taking of blow watched by grandfather bed when be in a sore strait a came round be none worse for though blow must have killed man with softer skull curse upon bairds say have ever be race of thief raider be doings have brought trouble on border a long a can remember have gone to bear news to adam armstrong father yes sent off messenger on horseback a soon a have gone adam left early man will meet on way back hour later indeed adam armstrong rode in oswald met outside face be set hard must scarce have recognized kindly genial man who have always received so heartily there be hope that will live oswald said there be slight change in expression of armstrong face 't be well said that one must be saved to take revenge for foul business others be gone hope may rescue cousin might a well try to rescue young lamb have be carried off by eagle said bitterly even must archer send shaft through bird breastbone lamb must be bleeding injured beyond hope ere touched ground may revenge oswald have hope of rescue then went into house without further word chapter dangerous mission hour later adam armstrong came out of cottage where son be lying mood have changed have gathered hope from meg margetson confident assurance that there be ground for now let talk of what have best be done oswald said a led way into next cottage where woman at once turned child out cleared room for what force must gather uncle in grandfather time said two hundred armstrong follower must gather in case of need family be grievously thinned in day when edward carried fire sword through scotland for last fifty year roxburgh part have be mostly under english rule in time have never gathered a family still kin must know take up quarrel must say that in twelve hour must gather fifty sixty stout fighting men bairds must be expecting can put with family allied to retainer nigh three hundred men under arm hold be so strong one took fifteen hundred englishman under umfraville three week to capture be destroyed then be stronger now than ever must get aid from roxburgh think fear not uncle know that governor have strict order not to give douglas pretext for invading to hold garrison together since earl may at moment endeavour to capture town before help must arrive even be to send four five hundred men bairds must hold out for fortnight at least long before douglas must be down with army to rescue have be talking over with trusty companion here agrees with that unless body of men at arm must avail to capture fortalice by sudden assault can be raised must trust to guile rather than force propose that will at once start for hold see how matter stand where prisoner be confined what hope there be of getting free propose to send other man to yardhope to tell father what have happened to ask to warn friend to be ready to cross border to join force can gather for attack on bairds be true that stringent order have be issued that there be to be raiding in scotland father must not heed that for moment attack have be made upon killing of wife sister wounding of allan carrying off of niece must be deemed by grievance sufficient to justify disregarding order besides have old grievance against bairds be more bitter since led scot to attack yardhope can guarantee when get word from a to day place will meet there with at least hundred spear be true that with force that can bring must not hope to capture bairds hold together must carry sword fire through district before must gather force to meet in field fear must not do oswald william baird must be capable of hanging girl from battlement when first fire be lit oswald be silent from tale have heard of ferocity of dreaded marauder felt that be more than probable that uncle be right seems to said after pause that be best for to send two men to parton be a have heard though have never be there ten mile south of bairds let give name of johnstone at tavern where put up say expect relative of same name a soon a can find out how affair have best be managed will give instruction a to plan propose one will carry to other to father will parton be good place for to join force a well a other oswald plan seems to good one at rate can think of nothing better brain be deadened by terrible misfortune have own will must ride straight to bairds hold challenge brother son to meet one after in fair combat must be well contented if must slay one two of before being killed can quite understand uncle death must be in way advantage to girl nay must rather render more helpless therefore pray to let carry thing out a have planned uncle nodded will send out dozen runner to friend said beg to be here tomorrow morning early then when have talked matter over with will ride to roxburgh lay matter before governor know that will get help from at least when hears of gathering here will know 't be with evil intention against english ten minute later oswald messenger started for yardhope with full account of step be taking of arrangement have be made done have long talk with roger now roger said will be most dangerous business in have be concerned must not venture to undertake did not know must rely absolutely upon will do best master will adventure life more willingly since be in service of allan janet armstrong be always pleasant friendly with at yardhope like for a well a because be cousin now master what be to be done have gown with roger master know always told to take with thinking that might come in useful carried under saddle time be in wale seeing that be ride to jedburgh back thought that there must be occasion for be unfortunate roger for be upon that must depend to get entry into bairds hold well master can doubtless get rough cloth of colour at jedburgh indeed there be small monastery about three mile hence on road may be that if adam armstrong will go with say wherefore be wanted prior will let have one will see at once time must be lost while be away must shave head again roger face fell 't be hard master after have grown so well to match rest still for so good purpose must even give in on hearing what be wanted armstrong mounted rode off at once while be away one of villager shaved top of roger head again in hour armstrong brought back monk gown be loath to let have even for such purpose though told that be once monk of order finally said that conscience must not allow to lend that must sell to for six penny gladly gave be dark now oswald said know not road can give man to put on way will not make straight for bairds will strike road from glasgow ten twelve mile north of place so that can come down from direction then guide after taking on to road have best take charge of horse lead to parton there to remain with until messenger one from yardhope arrive must be a well to have horse there for can not know what need may have of will arrange at once oswald be there aught else yes uncle must leave armour clothes here borrow others will pas a disguise how must go oswald in truth be difficult matter that of minstrel must be best passport know nought of harp other instrument might go a vendor of philter charm sort of half witted chap whose mother concocted such thing must never let into bairds castle oswald then must be rough man at arm one who have be in service of earl of march who when turned traitor went over to english found without employment asked nothing better than to enter service of someone who will give bread meat in return for service that can render whether in hunting up cattle among hill striking shrewd blow in service of employer if need be must do if can think of nothing better oswald will speedily bring thing require a will be found in house in village ala will be needed more by who wore must be of good size uncle ay ay lad there must have be tall fellow among slew today hour later roger oswald mounted uncle sent two of men with saying that must look strange be one man to come with two horse to parton that two saying that master must follow must seem more probable tale will if can find quiet farmhouse mile out of village there get lodging for beast can arrange with to take up station on road so that can if need be find be with sigh roger flung into saddle be not horse on have ridden there strong shaggy pony doe not look much one of men said there be better horse of sort in country have speed bottom can carry up down hill be a sure footed a goat roger have assented to change for own horse be a unlike one monk must have bestrode a must be well imagined have obtained stout staff to village smith have added two three iron ring at end rendering formidable weapon indeed in such hand reminds of start for dunbar master said one might have worse weapon than swung round head in quarterstaff fashion still prefer mace that staff will do just a well roger man must need hard skull indeed to require more than one blow from such weapon now that adam armstrong have done that there be to do went again to cottage where allan lay have paid several visit there in afternoon there be nought for to do comfort to be gained from white face of insensible lad meg assured however that be going on a well a must be expected be in torpor at present said may so lie for two three day so long a there be fever will hope know when open eye there be nought to do to keep wet cloth round head to put on fresh poultice over wound hour now armstrong took place by son pallet for time work of making preparation for oswald departure of sending off message to friend have prevented thought from dwelling upon loss throughout night picture of home a have left when rode out that morning thought that be now empty shell wife dead daughter carried off son lying between

be there to watch till nine if one came along be then to return to lodging feel stiff in leg master roger said fifty mile ride up down hill be joke after hard day work will soon come right again roger feel stiff though pretty well accustomed to horse exercise however when present at hold dusty footsore will look character thoroughly be sorry when arrived at small village quarter of mile from bairds hold went in together to little ale house vigorously attacked rough fare set before hast thou travelled far host asked a watched eating indifferently far monk said 't be five twenty mile hence to moffat must have seemed farther to have not good fellow overtaken fell in with pace be good company though monkish gown have little in common with steel pot broadsword talk song lightened way whither

temper spoke of suppose have also priest in fortalice ay bairds be not must rather not talk of be near neighbour among very best customer a spoke four armed men came in at door good day wilson whom

liking have come south to seek service with one who will welcome strong arm to wield sword hast tried douglas no said douglas have men enough of own methinks must not care to be mewed up in one of castle have have enough of already seeing be man at arm with george dunbar till turned traitor went over to english look likely fellow know pay men here to do fighting for 't be very well for great noble like dunbar douglas to keep men always in arm ready to ride at moment notice to carry fire sword where will war be not business save when there be trouble in air mayhap run short of cattle horse have to go fetch from across border be true that there be always score two of up there for somehow bairds have enemy most of follower of house live on holding raise cattle mountain sheep grow oat live a best can for must rather live with others oswald said be used to to live in hut on moor must in way be to fancy if can not get place where have comrade to talk to crack joke with must rather cross sea take service with irish chieftain travel to wale where hear men say there be fighting need not go very far if be fighting that want man said who ride with bairds have share more of if like to stop here day two will take opportunity to talk to william baird to one of son if find chance can not take up there now at best of time be not fond of visitor must be le so than usual now other armed men have come in while conversation be going on further attention be paid to traveller others sitting down at table across room talked among care not for work one said presently raising voice to higher pitch than in others have spoken across border be a ready for work a when come to scot against scot like not why man said what qualm be be scot always fighting against scot ay have be so a far back a one have ever heard doe not take much for douglas dunbar to get to loggerhead a to wild clan of north be always fighting among yes be very well other said there be reason why neighbour must not quarrel here must rather that summoned friend met in fair fight have out than one must pounce upon other when not expected slay burn unopposed ay ay two three others of men agreed be doubtless better so when be scot against scot 't be border fashion put in there be law on border fight in own fashion today be turn tomorrow may be someone else follow chief just a northern clansman do whether be musgrave baird fenwick armstrong be chief in own hold care for king earl fight out quarrel a may please be one of william baird men quarrel be mine whether ride against king of scotland king of england against douglas percy armstrong musgrave matter not value of stoup of ale be so nigel so say methinks that one may have preference for one sort of fighting over must rather fight matter out man against man than fall suddenly on hold where none be ready to encounter roger during pause in conversation at other table got up from seat stretched well friend said to oswald will go up see if will make welcome at hold if do may see more if not will return here to sleep therefore bid good day hope that may find such service a will suit benedicite paying for refreshment roger took staff from corner went out hearty fellow stalwart one man who have spoken to said must not care to have crack over crown with staff of met coming down from north comrade twenty mile away be near moffat overtook must rather drink with than fight with seldom have seen stronger looking man be of opinion comrade of monk be not bad fighter there have be bishop who have led monk to battle before now proved stout men at arm after others have gone out oswald strolled through village then mounted eminence whence must take view across valley of of hilltop to northeast on one of two mile away must make out man standing by horse watched for little time beyond taking few step backwards forward man did not move be lookout said to be doubt watching road from kelso jedburgh baird will hardly think that armstrong can have so soon gathered force sufficient to attack may have thought a well to place one of men on watch wonder how roger be getting on think must have taken in must have be back before roger have walked quietly up hill on bairds hold be perched man stepped forward from gate a neared none enter here said without permission from master will tell that poor monk of order of saint benedict on way from convent at dunbar to one near carlisle of brother be prior prays hospitality for day two seeing that be worn out by long travel sentry spoke to man behind latter took message to william latter be in good humour have not taken part in raid on armstrong have be led by thomas baird cousin fact that latter have be entirely successful have burned down armstrong house brought back daughter have given greatest satisfaction there be long standing feud between two family fact that armstrong be on good term with english neighbour still more that one of have married sister in law of forster of yardhope have greatly embittered feeling on side have long meditated striking blow at present time have be exceptionally favourable douglas have hand full be on ill term with rothesay whose conduct to daughter have deeply offended newly acquired land of earl of march gave much trouble be jealous of great influence of albany at court be moreover making preparation for serious raid into england be not likely then that must pay attention to complaint armstrong might make of attack upon especially a aid be of small use to while bairds must at moment join in invasion across border with three hundred good fighting men william baird have not a yet even considered what must do with captive might give in marriage to of younger men of family might hold a hostage a to injuring personally did not think of slaughter in raid be lightly regarded to ill treat female prisoner must arouse general feeling of dissatisfaction along border reprisal might be made by armstrong friend in case there must be such widespread reprobation excited a william baird reckless a be must hardly afford to despise therefore when roger request be brought to said at once take up to father kenelm tell to look after monk comfort evening can bring down to hall will question a to journey roger followed man through courtyard paid apparently attention to what be going on there quick glance enabled to perceive that hold be full of men followed guide up winding stair to turret on wall lower story of be inhabited by priest soldier knocked at door on being opened by priest gave baird message to be tall man spare bony be baird report said that in youth have ridden on many foray in england fighting men be common in family have be thought well that one must enter church a be always good to have friend who must represent there must complaint be made explain matter show that family be in wise to blame moreover a be necessary to have priest at chief fortalice of family be best that must be one who must not be too strict in penance must be conveniently silent a to doings within wall priest have accepted role not unwillingly be ambitious man saw that a one of fighting bairds there be small opportunity of rising to aught beyond command of one of hold douglas regarded with friendly eye for breach of truce brought upon constant complaint from english warden who might day other lead force to punish family have be one of few exempted from general pardon at last truce a priest must have better opportunity for bairds have much influence along border might day other exert in favour so far such opportunity have occurred have be disappointment to that henry in last invasion have kept along eastern coast hoped that war assuredly must ere long break out violently must give chance longed for might be sent by uncle to douglas with offer of service might even go north have interview with albany once fairly away from liddesdale be resolved that must be long time indeed before returned be now thirty year of age with hard keen face well brother said be not often that of order sojourn here be glad to have one with whom can converse of other matter than arm armour foray war matter be indeed too much in men mouth roger said though own myself in degree be interested in for have have choice of vocation must rather have be man at arm than monk wonder not at that other said seeing nature have be bountiful to in matter of height strength doubt not that must in case of need use staff carry with good effect methinks might do so happily none have molested on way seeing perhaps that wallet be not likely to be full one that mayhap be hardly worthwhile to meddle with with so small prospect of plunder come in sit down priest said uncle have consigned to care will sup in hour will not be sorry roger replied for though broke fast on black bread small beer down in village be poor nourishment for man who have travelled far who have large frame to support how come to be here roger again repeated story must have be shorter for to have travelled down through berwick brother difference be not great roger replied have to carry message to edinburgh from there be shorter to keep west of pentlands come down to lanark thence through moffat yes suppose be a short have trouble on way roger shook head generally join traveller other make journey pas quicker came down here today with stout young fellow who overtook side of moffat be somewhat out at elbow looked askance at at first turned out blithe companion got on well together must troll good song own voice be not wanting in power be curious that also be from dunbar though not immediately having must seem wandered for time on lookout for service what be cattle drover no have be man at arm of george of dunbar at least so understood when earl fled douglas took possession of dunbar lost living told that have made way down here in hope of finding employment on border where blow be common good blade be of more use than be farther north said that might have found employment under albany under other great lord said that have seen earl of march fugitive that cared not to enter service of noble who might in turn be ousted from place lose life a for albany thought from what heard that must rather serve than other master said 'why not rothesay who must be king of scotland laughed lightly said a rothesay have managed to get upon ill friendship not only with earl of march with douglas a heard with albany thought that chance of becoming king of scotland be not worth considering must be bold varlet thus to speak irreverently of great one think not that be bold roger said only merry thoughtless young fellow who in such company a mine let tongue loose said what first came into head a to matter methought spoke not without warrant came from north now know not whence came last think that be at edinburgh have taken service there when english king sat down before a know nought came of siege at moment horn blew there be supper priest said will go down meal be laid in hall however be not large enough to contain more than ordinary retainer of hold men who have come in at summons of baird be provided for in courtyard table being occupied entirely by member of baird family others who always acted with have not yet taken seat when priest entered with companion whom at once took up to sir william baird by saint andrew monk have seen finer figure for many day pity that monk gown must clothe such limb a yours have always be mine own opinion roger said with heartiness raised smile on hard face of men standing round look a if have carried arm did so in wild youth roger said have thought of ever donning monk hood be grievously wounded in foray in northumberland when reached home at lauder well nigh died of fever of wound swore that if life be saved must become monk got well kept vow methinks have known how dull life be must rather have died of fever a story be perfectly true save name of birthplace roger spoke so heartily that one doubted story monastery be at dunbar have be at dunbar rotherglen ask where convent stood a roger have stayed there when with oswald be at dunbar be able to answer other question satisfactorily party then took place at table priest roger sitting at bottom of conversation at upper end naturally turned on foray general disbelief be expressed a to chance of armstrong retaliating be out of question one of bairds said must not raise fifty men doubtless will send complaint to douglas have hand well full be not likely to quarrel with about trifle when may want aid at moment against albany against english what do intend to do with girl have not settled yet william baird said shortly at rate for present will hold a hostage think that anything be likely to come of affair if must hear of force approaching likely to give trouble must send word to that if arrow be loosened at wall will hang girl out a mark for archer fancy will send trooping off again at once a soon a meal be over carousal began priest rose accompanied by roger retired to chamber chapter escape oswald who be thoroughly fatigued with event of last thirty six hour slept soundly on armful of rush that host threw down in corner of room for at eight o'clock man who have spoken to on previous evening came in have spoken to william baird said told that seemed likely fellow called down monk asked several question about told at last must bring up to see so come along at once thanks comrade oswald said a slung long two handed sword from shoulder likely looking young fellow indeed baird said to rotherglen whom have sent for to be present over six foot must fancy have not attained full width so must fain take service with said want master oswald replied from what hear be more likely to see fighting under than under other on border be with george dunbar be oswald replied indeed service be not altogether to taste for be always pent up in dunbar save in street broil there be need to draw sword be glad enough to leave service though in truth have fared badly since now do question rotherglen number of question be put to oswald concerning name of street direction name of principal inn approach to castle be satisfactorily replied to know dunbar there be question about can use arm think so will have trial baird said man be use to who can not use weapon send robert here in minute one of young bairds entered be man of about twenty five tall sinewy be accounted best swordsman of family cousin robert william baird said young fellow must enter service before take must see that know business do take turn with sword with not two handed sword want to be slain take couple of sword from wall give steel cap full body armour that of own must not keep out good downright stroke by time that oswald be armed number of bairds friend have assembled in hall hearing of what be going to take place fine young fellow truly rotherglen said in height width match robert well though of course cousin must be more powerful seeing that be four five year older than young fellow who when reach age bid fair to be well nigh a strong man a monk roger have just entered with priest well monk baird said be going to try mettle of companion of yesterday answer not for mettle roger said if fight a well a talk will not do discredit to a took place facing other looker on men well qualified to judge of strength sinew murmured to other that must be difficult to find better matched pair be about same height stood lightly on foot figure seemed full of life activity be smiling robert baird with smile of confidence of assurance in skill while oswald face expressed only good temper a others took belief that must at rate be able to make such defence a must assure being taken into bairds service first rally indeed proved more than robert baird have at once taken offensive showered blow heavily down while springing backwards forward with wonderful quickness activity oswald blade ever met did not give way inch even when baird most fiercely attacked then suddenly adopted same tactic a opponent pressed so hotly that be several time obliged to give ground oswald must twice have got in heavy blow abstained from doing so must see that antagonist be favourite among kinsman felt be to discomfit must excite feeling of hostility against panting from exertion drew step backwards lowered sword enough william baird said matter need be pushed further 't be long since have seen so good bout of swordplay young fellow have learned business if in other respect doe a well will make good recruit indeed what say lad will join for month till see whether like service can judge how service will suit for time will have living here drink money after if agree can either be retainer here will give holding on moor build shelter give horse after next foray clump of cattle will suit well oswald said like well month of trial propose will take if will let uncle a own man robert baird said if at end of month chooses service with like better to follow master with dozen men than to live alone on moor methinks must make cheery companion one must take to heartily indeed during long winter be slight thing to have one merry fellow who can keep one alive of whose mettle skill be well assured so let be then robert have tried yours must be advantage for month will remain here under malcolm eye oswald went down with man who be baird right hand in hold what will be duty asked to keep arm armour ready for service will be easy task methinks for see that instead of being polished bright a be ours at dunbar others keep steel cap back piece painted sombre colour other nodded yes arm be for use not for show when ride by moonlight care not to have presence shown mile away by glint of moon on armour will do turn of keeping watch ward just at present there will be good deal of for have be stirring up wasp nest mayhap may come try to sting when be off duty will be own master save that have best be within sound of warder horn will hand over horse to for present be at croft on opposite hill of tenant keep two three at service have only bairds own horse kept in hold must be too much trouble to gather forage for of twenty men who always live here indeed have room for such number mind that drink not too much over in village there for though bairds care not on feast day if whole garrison get drunk so that there be enough sober to keep watch ward set face against at other time seeing that lead to broil quarrel will take care like cup occasionally can drink with others without head getting addled a rule care not overmuch for after being roughly introduced to several of retainer a new comrade oswald be left to follow own device presently roger came out into courtyard so have got service comrade said in voice must be heard by of standing near have better fortune than have expected that have replied still thought that must be hard if one who must use sword indifferently well put great value on life must not find service on border how long do stay here be question have be arranged for have be seen speaking privately together might have aroused suspicion methinks will stay here two day to get rid of leg weariness be not so accustomed to long marching a be real meaning of question a arranged be have found out where prisoner be kept answer meant yes will not be difficult to get at evening before indeed when returned with priest to chamber have broached bottle together priest on part have asked many question a to state of thing in edinburgh dunbar be opinion of people with regard to duke of albany prince what must probably come of coldness be said to exist between roger be able to conceal ignorance of matter by saying that knew little of what be passing for that have be cellarer in convent went out little nevertheless have kept ear open a rode north to jedburgh have heard good deal of talk speculation be able to give various piece of news have not before reached ear of priest be not long in discovering that latter be ill satisfied with present position be ambitious to take part in more important affair presently said wonder father that man of ability must be content to remain a chaplain in border hold when there be so many opportunity beyond for one like to make way in church in truth priest said have have such thought hope day to see little more of world by way can read write brother asked suddenly assuredly roger replied guessed at once that question have be put at instigation of william baird who perhaps still have doubt whether be really monk affirmative answer must be almost conclusive proof that be so for very few outside wall of convent even among noble knight possessed knowledge of letter have missal here priest said carelessly have somewhat troubled being written in cramped hand perhaps must read for getting up took roll from closet roger smiled quietly a turned over by private mark upon knew that have be written at alnwick be doubtless proceed of foray upon monastery across border ran eye over then in sonorous voice proceeded to read aloud thank priest said when have finished truly be admirable reader well skilled in deciphering wonder that held not more important post than of cellarer roger laughed might have done so said in truth be not strict enough in matter of discipline to suit prior be somewhat over fond of wine cup more than once when seemed that might have be chosen a reader to monastery fell into disgrace lost chance indeed be far better pleased with post there than if have appointed sub prior vestige of doubt there might have be in priest mind have vanished a roger read for be conscious that must not have picked up manuscript have deciphered so easily fluently must be trying to good father roger went on to be among men who if report speak truly be somewhat lawless hold even church in slight respect surely among there can be little scope for ability be true brother be know kinsman of mine have many foe across border on side be forced to hold own a may be two day ago that be obliged to punish family have long be at feud with who might well have fallen upon hold if marched into england with douglas however have brought off two hostage for good behaviour of people yes chance word in village that party have just returned from foray have brought back number of prisoner not number brother two girl have seen woman in castle roger said william baird lost wife year ago care not to have woman in hold there be not married man among garrison if man take wife must go settle on land woman be in safe place of keeping be overhead there be wild young fellow among bairds girl be good looking therefore thought best to place in charge be why see two sentry marching on battlement one on side of turret keep key of chamber handing over to morning receiving again at night precaution wholly unnecessary methinks surely surely roger said wonder that be not offended told that be strange must not trust priest with charge of laughed said priest be well enough father kenelm remember also that be baird though priest must trust to ride with on foray across border a baird must not entrust with custody of woman may take a compliment have trusted a far a do roger answer to oswald have be eminently satisfactory to latter still more pleased be when later on in day roger repeated a passed be lodged in turret over chamber oswald be scarcely surprised for have noticed that two sentry be on wall on side although be one farthest removed from direction in foe be likely to appear have moreover just before dinner observed one of kitchen men go up with two dish in hand by step leading to top of wall on side there be hindrance to men going freely in out of hold a duty have be assigned to that evening strolled out of gate when became dusk soon after six o'clock for be now beginning of april walked down through village then taking off armour steel cap laying down under bush by roadside set off at top of speed in direction of parton did ten mile in under hour nearly ran against man who be standing in middle of road short distance from little town be that fergus be john master fergus will take watch tomorrow evening good keep horse saddled at time evening hold in readiness night thing be going on well may be here night be house be master where see light quarter of mile farther up hill where be sleeping in stable with horse be ten yard off right of house then must keep watch through night by turn get sleep in daytime hope will get away without waiting for force to come hold be very strong one strict watch be kept at night before must carry must have bairds on countryside down upon can get rope want long strong one there be rope in stable master be in use must be missed then run at top of speed down to town buy rope strong enough to hold weight of dozen men will want hundred foot of here be money man shot away into darkness in little over quarter of hour be back again with rope oswald took off doublet wind round round said begin under arm wind neatly closely so that will make more show than necessary be soon done then oswald started on way hour later entered tavern took seat with three four of men from hold called for wine for party sat there for time then one said be half past eight have best be going at seven o'clock gate be shut be opened for who belong to hold till nine after none be admitted till morning who come in then be reported to baird be lucky if get off with dozen extra go of sentry duty baird be good master in many thing be bad man to deal with when be angry if anyone be to be out second time did too soon after first offence must have skin nearly flayed off back with stirrup leather there be fooling with bairds oswald arranged with roger if latter remained in castle must always come down hour before garrison be moving a might then exchange word two unseen accordingly took place at angle of building where must keep eye on step leading up to battlement on north side presently saw roger descending waved hand caught follower eye latter on reaching courtyard at once joined have rope roger oswald began will reach from turret to foot of craig took off during night have just hidden away behind pile of rubbish in stable be girl locked up yes be there getting key william baird keep then must have something to force door open to saw round lock door be studded with iron be window barred be mere loophole there be getting through suppose there be step from room on to platform above doubt in fact there be sure to be suppose that will have difficulty in silencing priest roger smiled think can answer for must speak to girl through keyhole roger there must be difficulty about master have to choose time when priest be out then tell that be here roger be to be ready to escape whenever give signal ask if trapdoor leading on to platform be fastened whether can unfasten if not must break in from above can get on to top of turret easily enough by throwing rope up with hook attached of course two sentry must be first silenced must wait till must be on sentry there might not occur for week can not prolong stay here more than day therefore will try have given men with horse notice do get priest bound gagged by ten o'clock everything will be quiet by time will come noiselessly up step at hour do be at door on lookout for sentry will have to be silenced be most difficult part of business can manage roger said confidently one blow with quarterstaff on back of head under steel cap will do noiselessly enough must not do roger man must go down with such crash that fall of armour on flag must be heard over castle must be gripped by throat so that can not holloa then bound tightly gagged before have time to get breath suppose must be best way roger said regretfully must like to have struck two good blow one for sake of dame armstrong one for allan however plan be best only difficulty will be trapdoor well must look about today get couple of bit of iron that can use a prise still hope that will not be needed saw bit of iron in stable that think can bend into hook for rope if ca have doubt that can be have better move away now people will be stirring directly that night at ten o'clock when in hold have be asleep hour oswald rose quietly from rush on dozen of comrade be sleeping made way noiselessly out of room went into stable fetched piece of iron have during day placed so that must feel in dark took coil of rope in hand ascended step top be ten foot from turret stood quiet until heard sentry moving away from then mounted last step in moment reached foot of turret stair roger be standing there all right master whispered took priest by surprise be gagged before knew what be happening tore blanket up into strip tied down onto pallet with be safe enough now for sentry will take one to right first will go out stand in angle be dark night there be chance of seeing when hear walk cease will know have got have managed to bring up rope have cut into handy length here be two of there have just turned so will go at once how about trapdoor be all right master be bolted on inside have tried bolt find can move with word at once stepped noiselessly out oswald stood listening presently heard returning step of sentry came close up to turret then suddenly ceased at once hurried round sentry hung limp in roger grasp oswald bound hand tightly twisted rope three four time round body securely knotted then tied ankle tightly together will lay down roger whispered when have done so oswald bent man leg trussing up fastened rope from ankle to bound wrist roger now relaxed grip of man throat thrust piece of wood between teeth fastened by string going round back of head then took off steel cap laid distance away will do for master reckon that will be hour two before will get breath enough to holloa even without gag other man be captured a silently a former have be when be bound roger said now for hook master here be iron be too strong for to bend roger took exerting great strength bent across knee then took coil of rope tied knot at end with smaller cord lashed securely along whole length of hook now master do get on to shoulder think will be able to hook to battlement be not above twelve foot if find that can not step on head be sure can reach without that roger indeed found that must do so easily having fixed firmly got hold of rope hoisted to top of turret in minute roger be beside feeling about soon discovered trapdoor on roger knocked three time then heard grating sound below shortly one end of heavy trapdoor be slightly raised two men got finger under pulled up janet jessie ran out cry with joy excitement hush oswald whispered utter sound there be sentry on other part of wall slightest noise might be heard now will knot rope roger set to work before long knot be tied foot apart along whole length of rope will take down first jessie for be lightest oswald said now roger tie together one of piece of rope roger have brought be passed round round tying firmly face to face now jessie have best take hold of rope too take a much of weight off a can be long way down though think must carry weight that distance be best that must help a much a be able rope be shifted to outside of turret roger after fixing firmly helped over battlement holding oswald by collar until have firm grasp of rope in hand obtained hold with foot be right jessie whispered a girl also took firm hold of rope be weight like now let rope pas gradually through hand when tell hold tight by one of knot after lowering forty foot oswald found that be standing on ledge of rock three inch wide at foot of wall now dear will be more difficult said must use one of hand to push off from rugged point there be not many of have look at rock today face be almost smooth will do best can to keep from in three minute stood at foot of craig oswald shook rope violently to let above know that be down then untied cord bound to cousin who at once sat down sobbing hysterically oswald put hand upon shoulder steady jessie steady have be brave quiet coming down danger be over now have long walk longer ride before will need strength in very short time roger janet joined a soon a be untied janet threw arm round oswald neck spoke for first time oh oswald from what have saved how brave good of to risk so much tut tut janet a if must leave here in hand of bairds without making effort to free now come along dear be very careful how walk till get down to bottom be pretty steep if be to set stone rolling might have after in time a be will only have hour half start for sentry will be relieved at midnight however by time will be on horseback of course wo know road have taken a soon a came to level ground set off at run be mile from village when heard on still night air distant shout followed minute later by winding of horn then almost immediately glimmering light appeared on highest turret of hold rapidly broadened out into sheet of flame have discovered escape by misfortune other oswald exclaimed will be after before many minute have passed must run in earnest now girl do run on oswald janet said roger will turn walk back will do harm oswald thought of murder of girl mother knew that in fury at having be tricked bairds be capable of anything be not to be thought of said watch must henceforth be kept that there must be possibility whatever of effecting rescue must take chance together what think have best be done roger in sooth know not be ready to do think best can not hope to reach parton before overtake oswald said besides bairds be sure to have many friend there lighted beacon will warn countryside that something unusual have happened can not think of going there said that there be horse janet said be short distance on side of town must not hope to get there before bairds even if did must be quarter of hour before must mount be off must not hide get horse after have passed master roger suggested must be useless roger road lead up down valley there must be possibility of riding horse across hill at night so that must have to ride down through parton up past bairds hold no horse must be given up for present only thing can see be to cross esk to take refuge in hill know not if there be ford where be be to turn to right must be getting farther farther away esk be great width can carry across easily enough water will be dreadfully cold jessie said with shiver for be now beginning of april hush jessie sister said what matter little cold when life be at stake be only hope oswald said quick girl there be time to lose river be fifty yard from road ran down to now girl oswald said when reached must take off cloak upper garment be to get wet must before morning die of cold lose moment undress under shelter of bush now roger let move few yard away then take off doublet shirt swim across holding above water by time that be back girl will be ready will carry across master be of use two of going with so light burden will make nothing of made opposition minute later shirt doublet be made into bundle bound on roger head waded into water until reached chin then swam out distance to be traversed be fifteen yard few stroke of brawny arm brought to opposite bank having laid down bundle there swam quickly back again be ready girl oswald asked yes janet replied two white figure came out from bush carrying bundle do go into bush again for minute can not take bundle over together be better that must stand here in dry thing than wait in wet one over there minute sufficed to tie bundle on head of two men soon swam across to other side left there returned water be bitterly cold for girl oswald said a swam across together be master will only be in for minute will soon be warm again now girl have just heard sound of horse in distance oswald janet said listened sound travel far still night said can only just have started will be across long before come along now jessie will take first stream run strongly be best that went over separately have to do be to put hand on shoulder of of come along will carry till get into deep water roger said catching girl up in arm running into stream jessie gasped a water reached will be over in minute oswald said encouragingly now be going to swim put hand upon shoulder be right striking out strongly easily carried until be in depth now dear get ashore stand behind bush take off wet thing put on dry one will have janet across in time girl be carried across a easily a sister have be here be bundle dear jessie have taken hers dress a quickly a can stoop down a soon a reach bush will be here directly janet ran to thicket oswald roger threw down behind great stone two minute later must hear thunder of hoof go along road opposite must not make out figure how many be there of do think roger dozen so master yes must think be right however make difference be there ten time a many must not catch tonight chapter in hiding moment horseman have gone by oswald roger hastily dressed again be three four minute before girl joined have be long time oswald finger be so cold that must not tie string will soon be warm climbing hill will set blood in motion there be hurry now be safe until morning will make up hill until be thoroughly warm then will discus matter before be very far up ascent girl declared that be comfortably warm again well roger what do think best course will be bairds have of course sent horseman along other road will have heard from priest that have few minute start will know that can not have gone far party who passed will doubtless stop at parton other at next village higher up will be sure that concealed a passed have taken to hill on one side other of valley will naturally suppose that be side a must be madness for to plunge farther into country to west may be sure there will be score of men out on hill tomorrow searching for of may ride nearly to hiniltie to cut off there in case escape searcher on hill think that only plan will be to hide up for couple of day so then to make way down again to where horse be then make dash through parton must certainly be far best way roger said how be to manage for food for lady will go on until get to top of hill roger then find sheltered spot where can stop be of use trying to go on much farther for night be cloudy there be star to be seen must lose way directly for there be wind must serve a guide a to way be travelling when find good shelter must

must be pleased to know that have seen daughter few minute later set out forded river breast high carrying load on head then climbing hill made way to shelter whose exact position oswald have marked on starting by huge boulder stood on crest of hill fifty foot above roger be on lookout seeing two figure approaching when expected one grasped staff firmly who come there asked be roger have brought one of men with to help carry thing be going to hiniltie thought that armstrong must be pleased to know have seen daughter have got plenty of food skin of water be capital roger said cheerfully be

be blanket for one for to wrap round plaid fashion need one master in faith have more respect for gown than ever have before be wondrously warm with hood over head want nothing more be very well roger if need for shoulder need for leg for being without hose with nought sandal must be freezing will walk up down here for bit do wrap round leg like highlander petticoat when have tired will lie down try to get sleep for hour two a walked talked over plan oswald decided that before daybreak must set out on search for place of concealment will leave helmet breast back piece behind said will take staff then if be caught sight of by party in distance will look like shepherd while have on iron harness must at once suspect of being of party even though be alone a for monk robe must be detected mile off must leave behind roger said have not much on underneath roger bareness in such weather a must be a noticeable a gown mind before get light get lady up carry bag of victual water skin over crest may be sure that a soon a be light there will be many sharp eye watching hillside all along here man who have come up with have already wrapped in blanket have brought with have crawled in among bush be a must hear by heavy breathing already sound asleep after time oswald said that a have nothing more to settle must try get few hour rest there be not slightest fear of surprise roger be not long before be sound asleep oswald woke two three time at first sign of dawn shook roger have better wake lady in few minute roger get over crest let man a soon a have seen start at once keeping along behind ridge warn not to go down into valley until be fully mile beyond parton tell to look carefully along road before begin to descend to see that be clear even then let hide a much a may be behind brushwood rock until get down when have swum river let make wide detour round parton so a to come down to stable without being noticed will not be very long away 't be scarce likely among hill will find place that can crawl into think will have to content with lying down among heather must find spot where one on hill above can look down on will be quite safe from party moving along on same level a oswald have gone little distance when determined that better place must be found than plateau extended for two three hundred yard from edge looking down into valley beyond ground sloped sharply down again into deep hollow beyond be broken into rounded swell rising one above party lying among heather where be standing must not be seen by watcher from other point moreover be most important that must be in shelter before be fairly daylight therefore a soon a be light enough to take in principal feature of scene hurried back to companion can do better girl than to lie down together two hundred yard away pick way through bush where be thinnest so a not to disturb please be off at once choose spot close to where ground fall away on other side roger must tumble shelter down scatter stick for if anyone searching hillside came along must guess that have slept here there must be hue cry at once man have left sometime before for valley having gone off a soon a have spoken to girl oswald roger ran down to shelter speedily threw stone into heap scattered stick then after glancing round to see that nothing have be left collected blanket provision water skin taking up be armour ran in direction that oswald have pointed out to girl ground be thickly covered with heather have to step carefully to avoid pressing down reached edge of plateau without seeing girl after looking round for minute two oswald called aloud be answered by merry laugh jessie head rose above heather have indeed passed within five six yard of girl be good indeed oswald said a lay down beside if must not see when be sure that be quite near there be fear of searcher lighting upon sun have just risen mist still hang on top of hill went on be convinced that can not have be seen for men placed on watch be sure to be high up on hill will be time yet before sun rise high enough to drive away mist although be freezing sharply felt by mean cold a lay wrapped in blanket with heather rising well above sheltering from light breeze have sprung up at sunrise after chatting with girl for time roger oswald left crawling along on stomach got to edge of descent by time sun be well above hill mist have cleared off have extensive view from time to time caught sight of group of three four mounted men moving about searching valley while single men on foot rambled over hill be keeping up active search roger 't be well that went farther will scarce suspect of lying close to valley left expect main body have gone much farther have doubt bairds have couple of hundred men boy out must call out man boy from holding most likely get couple of score of men from village perhaps twice a many from parton doubt will think that if came in direction must last night have found way to one of track across hill be near that search will be keenest fortunately can not know that be here guess that be to yardhope that intend to take not to hiniltie still may expect that will try to cross border fancy will scarcely get through without fight better roger grumbled finger tingle to bring down staff on head of of bairds after trouble have given remained watching until became dusk except twice during day crawled back partook of meal with girl last time joined oswald said now in hour will be quite dark then can safely get up walk about for bit be sure must feel stiff lying still so long have never kept quiet for so long time since can remember jessie said laughing show that have have illness jessie however will be glad to get up stretch limb hour will be enough then will have good long night day of think will be safe to start next afternoon saw number of party searching hill in direction expect have become convinced that have not tried to get straight through roger be hunting back for be a well that will be dark in half hour will then have to give up search for night if there be couple of hour more light must feel very uneasy so must master must have little chance of mercy if fell into hand might well be that in anger might slay lady also must be like enough roger however there can be chance of coming here before be dark at nine o'clock started made way down with difficulty many slip fall into valley then kept along near river till oswald be sure be close to ford bade halt here went forward alone before have gone fifty yard nearly stumbled against man be john yes be be all well be all well have fright yesterday morning bairds searched cottage hut over hill on side say men rode almost a far a galloway gave up search before got here feeling assured that must have passed very soon after left hold must never have got a far down a 't be well did not search indeed oswald said story about horse might do well enough for who have interest in matter must never have done for bairds have be quiet today seem to have given up searching on side hear that feel sure now lady have made for hiniltie have have great force out among hill feel confident that must catch soon have got horse saddled be saddled brought down close to road fergus be with then bring across at once sooner be off now better be there of bairds men in town there be few of a one have idea that be like to pas through there will not be on lookout besides will have be among hill from daybreak morning expect by time there be soul awake in parton oswald returned to girl went out together to ford in couple of minute men be seen making way across riding two horse leading others thank heartily janet said for having so risked life for for have be caught with four horse must at once have connected with must have gone hard with have be keeping away from horse yesterday today just going to distance lying down where without being seen ourselves must watch anyone who went up to farm must have done good thought that be better that must be able to warn if have come taken horse away after crossing river fergus at once started on foot for hiniltie have already discussed how must ride have be settled that at starting janet must ride fourth horse that jessie must ride behind others by turn if attack be threatened jessie be to mount behind sister be to take place between oswald roger while own man rode close behind be just ten o'clock a rode through parton not light be to be seen whole place appeared wrapt in sleep went through at walk so that if heard must suppose that be belated party of searcher must give matter further thought after riding for short distance put horse into trot four hour later halted at point where road down esk valley divided one going to ferry few hundred yard farther on while other turned to left followed bank of liddel john have inquired about ferry learned that ferryboat no longer plied a since trouble began there be so little traffic that did not pay ferryman to remain there a have already decided to cross by ford four mile higher up did not matter a none of be aware of exact position decided to wait where be until daylight searching about found deserted hut with shed adjoining horse be led into party then gathered in hut john struck light while oswald roger broke up fallen gate fire be soon blazing although there be not slightest chance of anyone travelling road at hour hung one of thick blanket across window thus keeping out cold air a well a preventing light from being seen then party lay down men taking by turn to stand guard outside being relieved two hour a soon a day dawned again mounted be about four mile ride to point where road divided one branch going towards river seventy eighty yard away here stood square building of size used a refuge by traveller who arrived when liddel be swollen ford impracticable when rider have come within few yard of building two men hearing sound of horse hoof came out a eye fell upon party gave shout ran out into road drew sword roger oswald rode at parrying thrust of one of men oswald cut down while roger with tremendous blow from staff stretched other man on road ride on girl will follow oswald shouted jessie be sitting behind john janet dashed forward rode into water oswald roger followed a six men armed with spear sword ran out from house seeing that be too late leader shouted to others fetch out horse chase before party have gained opposite bank pursuer dashed into water press horse too hardly oswald said a galloped along be too close behind for to get help from of small village dare not follow into longtown have barely ten mile ride have two hundred yard start for first four mile held own then pursuer began to gain upon one of horse be carrying double roger oswald be heavier than of moss trooper will have fight for roger be just what be thinking master well there be three of a there be only six of ought not to have much trouble john will be match for one methinks can make short work of man when first come up with three of against two will be mere child play road be narrow one little used when came to foot of sharp rise oswald called to ahead to stop jump down jessie mount behind janet ride on ahead will soon get rid of fellow be quick moss trooper be now seventy eighty yard behind will fight on foot roger said a leapt off horse want hand for staff turning horse bidding john to do same oswald reined back animal three four length when bairds party be within twenty yard touched with spur dashed at meeting just abreast of roger first man met thrust at with spear oswald parried with sword with back handed blow smote man just under chin fell with crash from horse at same moment heard blow like of smith hammer a roger staff fell upon steel cap of first who attacked john be le fortunate for opponent spear struck in throat fell heavily from saddle well stricken jock one of shouted ride on after woman will settle with fellow before moss trooper must obey order oswald with touch of spur bridle caused horse to curvet round smote man so mighty blow on shoulder a well nigh to sever arm from body a wheeled horse again be nigh unseated by spear thrust struck on breast piece upon recovering struck opponent a passed so heavy blow in face with pommel of sword that sent senseless to ground other two men have furiously attacked roger whirling staff round head have kept at bay then staff descended between ear of one of horse fell headlong before rider must get foot from stirrup staff struck below steel cap just in front of ear without cry fell dead beside horse at that last of moss trooper turned horse galloped off at full speed have not taken long over master roger said with grim smile five men in minute be not so bad be afraid john be killed roger see to ay be sped roger replied a turned body over spear struck full in throat be what come of not learning to use weapon what will do with be faithful fellow roger a there be need for haste now will give sort of burial not let lie here in road have nought to dig grave with roger remarked there be plenty of stone about dismounted with roger help carried dead man short distance away laid down by side of great boulder then piled stone around over will do roger 't be not like anyone will disturb stone for year to come will rest a well there a if lay in grave now let look to others man have struck across throat last roger have hit be dead two of others be stunned while one upon whose shoulder roger blow have fallen be lying insensible evidently be fast bleeding to death can do naught for oswald said even have king leech here must not save now let be off will take horse master will be encumbrance now that poor fellow have gone have one apiece bring horse along with mounting rode quickly on at top of hill came up with girl who having seen result of combat have waited for now be safe free thanks to janet said jessie looked back saw fight a rode how quickly be over be grieved indeed john have fallen saw carrying off body covering jessie have noticed fall feared 't be over with be old retainer of father faithful one be sorry indeed that have be slain janet must hardly expect to come out altogether scatheless be others killed jessie asked two of be stunned will ere long be able to mount ride off again master oswald have gained most honour in fight killed one stunned have stunned one also have slain two have better arm roger know not that roger replied quarterstaff of weight be fine weapon say not that be to be compared to mace when on foot must a lief have a sword now jessie do mount john horse can ride quietly for longtown be three mile ahead rested there for couple of hour then mounted again crossed pentlands by horse track between cristindury gele craigs coming down into tynedale put up for night at first place came to at daybreak set off northward crossed reddesdale came down in afternoon into valley of coquet within two mile of yardhope great indeed be surprise joy of john forster wife when made out two girl riding with oswald towards hold what miracle be lad former said while wife be embracing niece heard two day since of raid on armstrong how girl be carried off by bairds here oswald put finger to lip to stop from saying aught of jane armstrong death have after dismounting whispered in mother ear before have time to speak to girl that a yet knew nought of mother death that have left to to break to have be since scouring country father went on to try to get friend to take matter up in truth be not over willing to do so all know that be slight enterprise to attack bairds in stronghold fared badly last time went there though be blow retreat know that bairds hold be not to be taken like country tower 't be greatly bigger stronger than ours scarce to be attempted save by royal army especially a whole countryside must be swarming round in few hour after crossed border time too be quarrel of people a say risk must be indeed great loss very heavy sent off messenger morning to armstrong to tell feared must not raise more than sixty spear with must ride to hiniltie join force must collect try with to surprise bairds hold rescue girl though seemed to be mighty dangerous enterprise will have learnt yesterday morning father that have carried off must have brought news last night to do so must have ridden fast girl being with thought be better to take two day over journey so slept in tynedale last night how did manage for unless roger flew into bairds hold carried off on back see not how must be managed why place be so strong that even douglas have not cared to carry out term of treaty for arrest of william baird a notorious breaker of truce between two country be because knew armstrong deemed that be scarce likely force must be gathered by friend strong enough to undertake such enterprise that decided to rescue by strategy affair turned out to be easy enough then related in detail manner in roger have obtained entry into hold have succeeded in rescuing cousin by bone of saint oswald from whom got name lad john forster exclaimed when have finished story have carried out matter marvellously well hotspur must not have contrived better own be wrong that fancy of yours to be able to read write have not done damage feared must henceforth will maintain with might that thing in way tend to soften man on contrary in way sharpen wit enable to carry out matter with plan contrivance such a must scarce be conceived by men who have not such advantage why do not go inside have be keeping here father because doubt not that mother have be breaking news to girl of mother slaughter said nought to about knew hold be burnt told that allan be wounded thought that if gave worst part of news must throw into such deep grief a to unfit for journey might not have be discovered till two hour after have started that have escaped in case must have be mounted before bairds overtook must have be ride for life girl must have needed strength courage to keep up be a well so oswald doubtless mother will break more easily to than must have done woman be better at such thing than men who be given to speak bluntly straight what have to be told chapter mission to ludlow while oswald be talking with father roger have taken four horse round to long shed that ran along one side of wall have there be telling moss trooper same story oswald have be relating to father whom now joined well friend roger john forster said a came up shaking heartily by hand by faith son be fortunate in having so stout fellow a henchman 't be rather that be fortunate in having a master roger replied have to strike a bid there be need for to think for brain bear proportion to bulk indeed even in matter of strength bid fair to equal for seems to to grow taller stronger month be not surprising seeing that be much beyond common in matter there be credit due to save have a faithfully a must carried out order men can try to carry out order roger be not who can do with intelligence doubtless have something to do with book learning that have in be instructor think not that be so in way master forster roger replied quickly for liked not thought that have gained advantage whatever from stay in convent might likely be useful to man of small stature whose thought must naturally turn to being scribe to making living by such finicking way instead of by bearing a man must for one like 't be time thrown away yet say not that may not be useful to master oswald who will day be knight go to court have occasion to write letter when have scribe at hand to do for good downright blow be more advantage to man strike than book learning that can get have done well enough without roger think that must be of use else why be that oswald be so good at devising plan have be in place when heard news of harrying of hiniltie carrying off of armstrong daughter must never have thought of starting on adventure a did may be that may improve mind master forster just a wielding mace strengthens muscle of arm only speak from own experience so far a can see hour spent on matter have be a good a wasted nay roger oswald who have be amused listener to conversation broke in have have evidence lately that be not so have not be able to read priest missal must have seen at once that be not monk fact that did so that much better more fluently than must have read strange manuscript be to confirmation of story not only enabled to rescue cousin probably saved own skin to say nothing of mine for have baird learned that be deceiving must a likely a not have hung over gateway of hold a spy roger scratched head in embarrassment can not gainsay master oswald though did not think of before be certainly proof that time spent in learning be not thrown away for a say have not be able to read that missal doubtless must have gone hard with of be not ashamed to own when be wrong must not be english honest not to do so reading certainly came in mightily useful there must also remember roger oswald said with smile that if have not be that read wrote better than most of other monk abbot must not have picked out a instructor must not have asked for to come with to scotland sir henry percy must never have begged abbot to allow to go forth into world say more master oswald never again will say word against reading writing see that be excellent thing never entered thick head how greatly have benefited by acquiring will maintain against who say contrary that be of great value that in way tend to soften man a can prove in own person also in yours at moment mary forster appeared at top of step supper be ready said have broken news to girl be quite broken hearted poor thing have sent to bed suppose be not leaving tomorrow morning oswald will be off at daybreak next day must not stay longer for ought to have be back three day ago sir henry will be wondering what have befallen talking matter over evening a to what have best be done with girl mary forster said that have expressed great anxiety to get back a soon a must in order that might try comfort father nurse allan john forster said that must ride with with four of men to hiniltie in day two next evening however there be knock at outside gate on being opened adam armstrong entered must not rest for thinking of girl said a entered house man arrived safely yesterday morning after having with great difficulty made way unobserved through bairds who have fifty sixty men scattered over hill do go to wife tell that father have arrived have be terribly upset john went on a wife left room be only told of loss of mother after arrived yesterday oswald thought that must need strength for journey that be better that mary must break news to when got here have felt for sorely adam since messenger brought news armstrong pressed hand silently be good wife to john right good wife buried what seemed to be remains yesterday morning be that kept from starting moment man came in with news that oswald have got girl out of hand of bairds how be allan trust will get right now have come partly to sens though be still dazed have carried in litter to monastery where obtained monk robe for man for feared to leave in village lest bairds furious at escape of girl might return to finish work be about to speak to oswald when door opened girl ran in be time before adam armstrong again turned to now lad said think because be long time coming to point think lightly of service have rendered ah lad must scarce believe ear when fergus told that henchman have got lass out of bairds hand have gone off on horseback with have to put question again again a to whether be sure that be really girl have with seemed to to be altogether impossible have to believe at last though how came about must not tell have time for talking oswald said moment be of importance matter be simple enough worth few word telling then related manner in roger have obtained entrance to hold have succeeded in getting girl away sound simple enough in telling armstrong said needed stout heart good nerve to enter bairds den on errand carried life in hand well must have borne out story to have passed without suspicion be well thought of indeed well carried out must have done credit to boldest craftiest leader on border what say john be proud of adam a for myself must never have thought of such plan if have have matter in hand might have taken twenty stout fellow tried to scale wall unseen to fall upon with spear sword in confusion carry girl off must have be desperate plan with small hope of success small indeed john small indeed armstrong said shaking head with prisoner in hold bairds be not likely to be caught sleeping have be accustomed to surprise a be whole garrison must have be afoot in minute not man of ye must have lived to tell story such mad thought passed through brain when first heard news be not for long even with spear others might gather friend in tweeddale must have have small chance of capturing bairds hold must have have annandale nithsdale down on before must have done at rate must have have to bide time wait until bairds be away to england with dalesman by time none must say what must have become of girl in fact there be one way of doing be way oswald hit upon well lad fear will never have opportunity of repaying debt owe after there be not armstrong on border on side yours for be half english half scotch will hold a among closest of kin will give welcome aid whensoever may need where be man roger will call oswald said stepping to door shouted to follower who came out at once from one of outhouse occupied by retainer of hold come up roger oswald said master armstrong wish to see roger came up a entered adam grasped by hand whenever time for fighting be over brave fellow remember that there be home for at hiniltie so long a armstrong dwells there thought when fetched that monk gown for that nephew oswald might be able to gather news let know possibly how girl be faring little did think that alone unaided must rescue from hand of bairds be merry business master armstrong pleased hugely save that went against heart to have bald patch on head again just when hair have so well grown covered be well nigh a good a fighting to trick bairds in own hold when a thought be so mightily sure be harmless brother of monastery for rest be easy business scarce worth talking of be done easily because be done well roger be well planned well carried out have nought to do with planning carrying out be simple enough there be there who tested a to knowledge of dunbar of monastery came from who further tested knowledge of reading once assured that story be true paid further attention to believing must stay day two to rest on way south have occasion however to use heavy staff carried slight occasion must have have chance to have used on head of of bairds for what little did master armstrong daughter thanked very prettily more than enough therefore pray thee say more of how be son be going on well meg margetson monk in whose hand have put say that hope be out of danger next morning oswald roger mounted soon after daybreak rode to alnwick have night before be arranged that girl must for present remain at yardhope until hold at hiniltie be repaired put in state of stronger defence be agreed too that be a well that word must be said by armstrong on return a to whereabouts of daughter a bairds might then in anger make attack on yardhope whereas at present must have reason for suspecting that be there if obtained news that be not with father at hiniltie must suppose that have be lodged with of family elsewhere perhaps placed for safety in jedburgh have wondered what have become of hotspur said when oswald entered apartment to report return expected two three day since indeed wanted for other business be sorry lord after having fulfilled order gave to governor of roxburgh jedburgh became engaged in affair of uncle adam armstrong of so pressing character deemed must excuse when heard nature then briefly related how have be occupied since leaving jedburgh 't be good excuse indeed hotspur said must tell more of evening when earl wife can also hear a to business spoke of be of consequence at be to carry message to earl of westmoreland have now sent by hand winter passed quietly be work be light more than once rode home for few day once paid visit to hiniltie here number of men be at work exterior wall have in way suffered shell of central building have so far resisted fire that be not necessary to rebuild roof floor have be replaced defence considerably strengthened portcullis have be placed above door so that in case of outer wall being carried gate forced must at once be lowered projecting battlement have be thrown out over with opening below through boiling lead pitch must be poured on enemy trying to break in flanking turret for archer have be built at corner of house exterior wall have be strengthened by tower in centre of face on side of gateway will be safe now think oswald said allan who have almost recovered place can hardly be taken by sudden attack even by force bairds must bring against must get help from jedburgh long before must gain even outside wall father be going in fortnight to fetch girl rode over there week two since found looking very well happy with people of course be anxious to get back again especially a be so seldom at home if will fix day before go will try to be there to meet suppose a soon a spring set in fairly will be having trouble again be certainly a well that janet jessie must be at home again before begin for although yardhope be strong enough to resist attack by bairds other border ranger can scarcely hold out against regular invasion four day after return to alnwick oswald be sent for by percy scot seem to be moving yet latter said glendower be ever increasing in strength boldness have received startling news morning party of welshman be seen near ruthyn earl grey with body of mounted men rode out against retired at once briskly pursuing fell into ambush be captured 'twould have be thought that glendower must have put chief enemy to death at once be not so be said hold earl to ransom glendower have plenty of men doubt need money sorely can draw revenue from estate in denbigh in south wale can not suffice for expense of feeding body of men always under arm doubtless will ask for great sum 't be like that will get grey be favourite of king latter will doubtless aid for need service to hold flint denbighshire against welsh moreover methinks that king must for reason make effort to buy lord grey freedom for be secret that have great love for mortimer for although hold young earl of march prisoner at windsor can not forget that lad be rightful heir to throne that friend of richard must place there have opportunity mortimer be boy uncle not only from own estate a guardian of young earl wide possession in hereford in shropshire be very powerful noble king have real reason for doubting for know mortimer have thought of supporting earl of march claim to throne having held with rest of kingdom henry who be wise politic be far fitter ruler than lad must be doubtless henry be well aware of see that when young earl grows to manhood might become dangerous might supplant a supplanted richard thus then have doubt king will use effort to obtain release of lord grey in order that may act a counterpoise in welsh march to influence of mortimer however be not now question be evident by daring deed of glendower that will be busy year success of first attempt will assuredly add to following therefore a scot be at present quiet must that ride again to ludlow sojourn there while sir edmund sends scant news must fain know more closely how matter be going there how great insurrection be like to grow may well be that scot seeing how powerful glendower be becoming will enter into agreement with while invades west country will pour across border with force in case must be hard pressed for king power in south might be fully engaged against welsh must have to battle with whole strength of scotland alone therefore write at length giving full report of talk of country a to bearing of welsh not only beyond border settled in west county will of course take fighting monk with can aid in matter being good scholar though bad monk so when be weary of holding pen can dictate matter to will send two well mounted courier with will have relay of horse placed on road so that can despatch letter once week will also of course carry letter sir edmund mortimer may wish to send very well sir henry will start today nay matter be not so urgent a that then will ride tomorrow morning good be well pleased with oswald affair in rescued cousin showed that have discretion ability a well a skill courage see knowledge that gained at monastery be coming in useful to now a mark of approbation will order that one of warhorse will be saddled be in readiness for in morning steed mortimer gave be good one have need of for one may fall lame be killed wounded be well to have second string to bow moreover riding a do in service 't be meet must provide with horseflesh marked on horse today one rode when came here in truth have outgrown altogether though doubt not that sturdy little beast must even yet carry for long day journey 't be scarce in accordance with position a representative oswald thanked hotspur heartily for gift for have felt that needed second charger have be reluctant to ask father for money required to buy one for expense of repairing hold after last scotch invasion have be heavy gold be scarce commodity at yardhope started at daybreak next morning riding fine horse hotspur have given roger rode behind be followed by two lightly armed men who be to act a messenger one of led oswald second horse a soon a have left castle oswald called roger up to side well roger dare say be a pleased a be that be on move again 't be nigh five month since returned from ludlow save for adventure with bairds have have quiet time since think there will be work with welsh again master think so indeed roger say that glendower force be greatly increasing have captured lord grey hold to ransom king must regret now that parliament refused to listen to glendower complaint because have be one of richard men have perhaps spoken more hotly than be prudent touching king murder say that richard be still alive that be with scot may say so roger think that be likely king figure be well known to hundred of men why doe not show even in scotland there be many noble who during truce between kingdom have be to london have known king richard have man be must have recognized at once besides think that when king have richard caged in pomfret there be chance of getting free again may suit albany at present to set up puppet other in order to cause uneasiness to henry to render richard friend here unwilling to obey order of king to take field against scot have be richard 't be not in scotland that must have shown in france where must gladly have be received a anne of bohemia husband must have have aid support to urge claim well master care not what take to wale at rate be glad to journey thither for seems at present a if there only be there chance of giving taking hard knock how be that take party of men at arm a did last time mortimer have plenty of men without handful that percy can spare must be of little use be going principally because hotspur be anxious to be kept well informed of what happens in west for feel sure that if glendower power increase will be needful to send strong english army there scot will make great invasion will behove northern county lord to hold in readiness travelled fast in five day after leaving alnwick arrived at ludlow welcome back again master oswald sir edmund said when arrived thought that maybe sir henry percy must send hither matter here be becoming serious 't be said that there have be scotch emissary with glendower though for truth of can not answer percy will certainly wish to know well what pass in west be poor hand with pen moreover too much busied to write often know that right well doubt not be instructed to inform of pass be right sir edmund be for purpose that have sent hither charging to write to frequently a to situation power of glendower must need be on increase since nought have be done to bring to reason have also command to place at service to obey in respect a if have be squire will be glad for to ride with knight sir edmund replied courteously have not forgotten that did good service last year trust that may find opportunity for winning spur will be glad indeed to do so sir edmund may ask where glendower be supposed to be at present have headquarters on summit of plinlimmon great hill on border of montgomery thence ravage plunder country round slaying who be supposed to be attached to english cause unfortunately meet with little resistance for castle have for most part be suffered to get into bad state since for hundred year have seemed that must no longer be required against welsh who appeared to have become a peaceful a people in own county many of knight have built more convenient house have let castle become almost ruin then too garrison where garrison be kept be for most part composed of welshman can be no longer trusted be easy matter to obtain englishman in place for so great be terror caused by slaughter by glendower of who fall into hand that few even of adventurous spirit must at present care to leave home beyond severn to take up such desperate service glendower movement be so rapid that there be notice of coming be not until band suddenly appear burning slaughtering that know of approach surely must be difficult to victual so large force on summit of mountain must assuredly be so only keep hundred fifty chosen men with be beacon fire to be lighted there must in few hour be ten thousand men on mountain then again a whole population be with be to start with five hundred men from here news must reach by mean of smoke on hill before have marched five mile away 't be warfare in there be credit to be gained much loss to be sustained see not that with anything le than army large enough to march through wale from end to end burning town village putting to sword who resist affair can be brought to end be only thus that harold brought wale to reason so strongly that be two generation ere ventured again to cross border be so that edward finally stamped out rebellion methinks that work will have to be done again in same manner so far from doing good king invasion last autumn have encouraged for though so numerous army effected nothing showed welsh how powerless troop be to enter mountain to take offensive anywhere save on level ground oswald life at ludlow differed in way from at alnwick took meal at high table sitting below knight with sir edmund squire practised arm with tilted in courtyard of castle occasionally rode out hunting hawking with party of knight lady helped to drill body of tenant who hundred at time came in to swell garrison sometimes carried mortimer order to governor of castle rode with strong party into hereford radnor short time after arrival montgomery be taken by storm by glendower englishman welshman suspected of friendship for english slain shortly afterwards suburb of welshpool be burnt by to great loss of earl of powys whose annoyance be greater since most of own tenant be under arm with glendower following hard upon piece of bad news came word that have fallen upon abbey of cwmhir six mile from rhayader in radnorshire entirely destroyed news caused great indignation reason for sacrilegious act be warmly discussed at castle reason methinks sir edmund said after have listened to knight for time be twofold in first place ecclesiastic for most part monk of order save franciscan favoured king henry against richard chief reason be long animosity between church bard of whom glendower be great patron who have done great service by stirring up people with song bard have ever be foremost in instigating insurrection in wale edward first attempted to suppress altogether edict for executing by martial law be still unrepealed dare not venture to show in castle town held by have to man rallied round glendower house be always open to be even distinguished by welsh name meaning protector of bard now after being hunted fugitive for so many year have doubt used influence with to stir up against religious house heavier blow still be struck by glendower feeling at ludlow be nothing short of consternation when fugitive arrived from town of new radnor saying that strong castle there have be carried by assault garrison of three score men beheaded town laid in ash be heaviest blow yet struck by glendower castle be of great strength town have be walled by lord of march that place must have be carried by welsh kern seemed well nigh incredible execution of whole of garrison aroused most lively indignation be war to knife indeed sir edmund mortimer said yet abhorrent a be wholesale murder of garrison can not own that be politic step on part of glendower news will spread throughout wale if so strong place a new radnor must not defend how can lesser castle hope to do so indeed will garrison care to man wall since resistance mean death doubtless there be many welsh among men who be murdered may be sure that compatriot in other castle will hasten to desert join glendower indeed proved to be case garrison of castle dwindled away hold after hold fell without resistance even in ludlow precaution be taken welshman be expelled from town garrison be also purged of although of men at arm have served for many year men be told that after trouble be over must again be taken into service if chose that in present state of thing one traitor might endanger safety of castle town that a be impossible to tell who be true men who have be corrupted by glendower agent be necessary that must suffer even if innocent among tenant of mortimer estate of young earl be many welsh against measure be taken father sometimes indeed three generation of have lived peaceably have rendered military service when required in trouble of england mortimer be reluctant to treat harshly especially a declared readiness to serve prove devotion to english lord be not sufficiently numerous said to be source of danger be glendower to invade england in great force doubtless must join to save life of family being one to four five of english tenant see not that can be source of danger to chapter letter for king large number of fleming have settled in wale having left own country in consequence of constant trouble there many of have set up cloth mill at welshpool other place having suffered great destruction of property at hand of glendower seeing hope of insurrection being put down by english resolved to take matter into own hand fifteen hundred of gathered secretly surrounded glendower in one of mountain intrenchment repulsed attack situation be desperate provision ran short be unable to summon help at last determined with little body of follower to endeavour to cut way out through besieger attack be sudden fierce fleming who knowing smallness of force have made preparation to repel attack be seized with panic at fierce appearance wild cry of welsh who fell upon with such fury that two hundred of fleming be slain welsh cut way through beleaguering line news of feat be received with immense enthusiasm throughout principality great number flocked to glendower standard bard sung song of victory at village in wale so formidable did position become that lord of march wrote to king saying that matter have gone altogether beyond that presence with army be urgently needed even in ludlow extra sentry be placed upon wall garrison be kept in constant state of vigilance mounted men be stationed mile out to bring in news of approach of hostile force 't be thousand pity sir edmund said when news of defeat of fleming reached that fellow did not send news to day two before undertook business for in case must have headed force of couple of hundred of best men at arm joined at spot in mountain have be there may be sure that glendower must never have fought way out fleming be doubtless stout fighter a have proved over over again in own country be unused to mountain warfare to fight with wild men be doubtless scared by shrill cry with welsh always advance to battle doubtless too men glendower keep with be best fighter knew that if did not succeed in making way out mercy must be shown to seeing that have shown none have battle be on plain doubt not that fleming must have stood against many time number of welshman owen have with hill warfare be altogether strange to of course have not habit of quickly rallying meeting attack be second nature with men at arm affair be serious unless king come hither with army glendower be likely to have own way on side of border ere long there wo be englishman left west of severn however henry when informed of danger lost time in assembling great army in beginning of june advanced into wale ravaged wide extent of country carrying arm into cardiganshire destroying abbey of stratum florida one of most venerable famous abbey in wale founded in be burnt down in during war of king edward first with welsh be soon rebuilt here llewellyn in convened chieftain of wale to take oath of allegiance there be two copy of national record one of be kept at abbey other at of conway abbey having fallen henry army met with scarcely resistance glendower knowing that wild follower be match for royal troop therefore contented with harassing continually army suffered greatly by continued annoyance a well a from fatigue famine thus king returned across border without having achieved success whatever lord of march be not now ordered to contribute troop be to hold castle strongly lest when army be fairly entangled among mountain glendower must make great incursion into england only advantage gained by english invasion be that king by promise of pardon reward drew away number of leading men who have hitherto acted with glendower defection however be more than made up by enthusiasm excited by spectacle of second retirement of great english army without having effected anything of importance so evident be that in october henry again advanced with contingent of fewer than twenty two county season however be already unfavourable for operation after enduring great hardship suffering army again fell back having effected even le than two have preceded thing however turned out fortunately for oswald army have advanced week across border when messenger arrived at ludlow with letter from london for king will be easy matter to forward sir edmund said a despatch be handed to indeed see not how be to be done beyond fact that king intended to march west know nothing whatever of intention of exact road be likely to take order be strict that be to keep force well in hand to send letter forward must need two hundred men at least a escort place in awkward position indeed if so please sir edmund said oswald who be one of group standing round when messenger handed letter to mortimer will endeavour to carry despatch for methinks that while fifty men must not succeed in getting through to army two might perchance manage to do so will of course ride first to shrewsbury through king passed so follow up course took there must be great difficulty in doing for march of so great body of men must have left many trace behind will doubtless have harried country for distance side of line followed be not likely must meet of welsh until be near army then of course great caution must have to be used for be like enough that there be party of glendower men hanging on skirt to cut off straggler plunder waggon whose horse may have fallen by way 't be terribly dangerous service sir edmund said gravely in truth see other way of forwarding letter for aught know may be of high importance if be desperate enterprise be also one will bring great credit if safely carried through will myself if go give letter to king saying that have volunteered for desperate undertaking from loyalty to person because be possible that letter may contain matter of highest importance to realm in general will add that have already greatly distinguished in service against welsh be trusty esquire of brother in law sir henry percy quite feel sir edmund that enterprise be dangerous one be nevertheless determined with permission to undertake henchman have together gone through danger a great may pas through a well will give answer in hour master oswald when have talked over with knight heard opinion a to whether better plan can be devised oswald bowed retired seeking out roger told of offer that have made well master if be bent upon enterprise will not find backward indeed be so sick of six month of idleness of seeing others marching to wale to fight while hing here that by saint bride be to ask to go into glendower stronghold pluck by beard must willingly go with oswald laughed 't be not so bad a roger yet 't be service of great danger how think that have best set about on horse on foot roger looked surprised at question must surely be better to go on horseback master for if met too many welshman to fight might at least ride away from there be truth in roger on other hand foot will carry up down mountain fell where horse must not go if mounted must travel by beaten track might be seized by party of welsh lurking in wood before knew of presence without horse must ourselves keep within shelter of tree must so evade observation of who might be stationed on lofty hill to watch if body of troop be following track of army moreover must have trouble about forage water for steed enough master see way inclination lie a leg have have long holiday be right that must carry for bit assuredly 't be easier for footman to hide than be for horseman must say roger that must be best to leave armour a well a horse behind if be attacked by number armour will serve little while if without may be able even if chased to avoid hand of welshman say that be swift of foot a can hold own with northumbrian border men ought to be able to do so against welsh especially a leg be nigh foot longer than of greater part of very well master have great love for travelling in armour must almost a soon march in monk gown again a in breastplate back piece very well so will arrange will have to carry provision for may be sure that will get nothing while be following army will strip country clean know how terribly have suffered by famine on two previous expedition will assuredly be better now food however can procure at shrewsbury from point will take start retainer at moment came out from hall informed oswald that sir edmund must speak with when entered mortimer said knight agree that letter ought to be sent forward to king for if contains matter of importance great harm might result from delay king anger be excited against for not having sent to order to be strict that of force must join therefore accept offer with thanks have formed plan for proceeding oswald repeated substance of what have said to roger think perhaps be right mortimer said that may have more chance of getting safely through on foot than if rode with small force to escort when be ready to start will speak to in private touching thing connected with journey when oswald returned mortimer said to see master oswald position be by mean simple there can be doubt that king regard with favourable eye hold nephew in keeping doubtless imago bear ill will a uncle supposes must at time party be formed to place earl of march on throne must be leader in matter though assuredly have never given reason to doubt loyalty say not that approved of deposition of king richard indeed have not like lord grey many other noble among percy be warm supporter of king henry cause hold altogether neutral in matter saw that nothing must be more ruinous for country than that boy like nephew must mount throne have party be formed to make king instead of henry must have taken share in nevertheless there be getting over fact that by right earl of march be king of england there be saying what may come about in future assuredly at present time be a ready to do duty towards king henry a be who be louder in expression of attachment to nevertheless be well aware that king distrust a see have not three time that have invaded wale come near ludlow have not summoned to join banner nay more have strictly ordered not to send man at arm to join own that letter trouble somewhat why must not have be carried to shrewsbury instead of being brought hither have indeed come from london who sent may not know that king must move by shrewsbury not by line must indeed be more direct for in advancing into montgomery cardiganshire on other hand may be snare if send not forward might blame greatly for holding back if send forward perchance fall on way into hand of welsh might harbour thought even if did not accuse openly of conniving with glendower one pretext be a good a however unlikely may be when king desire to make quarrel with one of vassal offer to carry be then very seasonable one go far to get out of difficulty in first place by sending by afford ground for to say have disobeyed order to send one of following to army in next place suspicion may have of assuredly can have none of percy to whom so largely owes crown that trusted squire of hotspur must be bearer of letter be sufficient proof that must be done be done for safe carriage must fail to deliver can at least not put down to fault of mine sir james burgon sir philip haverstone offered to carry urging that danger must fall on not upon who be still esquire have duty towards in affair that be shame that must remain here idle while rode perhaps to death assuredly feeling be with be not for circumstance in be placed must certainly intrust enterprise to on laying whole matter before pointing out that coming of two of knight to must be breach of king order saw that since be willing to undertake be best that must be so doubt not that henry must not unwillingly fasten quarrel on have army at hand did march hither must seize land of nephew partition out among friend for be in condition to strike single blow in defence know well enough that when king wish to get rid of one of noble there be never great difficulty in finding pretext for arrest execution quite understand sir edmund for part will assuredly do best to place letter in hand of king will say that being of sir henry percy household knowing that lord must be glad must have opportunity of striking blow under king leading volunteered at once when letter arrived to bear to that seeing majesty have laid order on to keep force in readiness to repel glendower must issue out in quarter granted request must be bearer will do well oswald know that danger be by mean small trust that may surmount will send off letter today to hotspur doubtless will be writing to explain to why have suffered to undertake so dangerous enterprise two hour later oswald having despatched messenger to hotspur with own letter that of mortimer mounted with roger rode to shrewsbury here be able to gather little news a to present position of army for four day messenger have arrived from king last news be to effect that army be marching forward through montgomeryshire on first starting have made long march to welshpool thence have proceeded to newtown on way welsh have rushed down from hill have fallen on baggage slain many of driver killed so many horse that have be necessary to leave of waggon behind at newtown halted party have be sent out in direction to harry country while part of force left at welshpool marched upon llanfair be last news have come through from king from welshpool heard next day that there have be several skirmish with welsh that heavy rain have made road impassable more message have come be not surprising a be certain that welsh must close in behind army a advanced a there must be no great occasion to send news back king must not care to weaken by detaching escort of sufficient strength to make way down if must have be sure way king have be going roger must have be much shorter for to have made direct for llanidloes certainly must master oswald see might have turned more to north in case must have perhaps be unable to gather news of whereabouts while must have run small risk of getting throat cut be evident roger that king be marching at present in direction of plinlimmon doubt hope that glendower will come down give battle methinks will not be foolish enough to do so weather hill will fight far better for than welsh can do have to leave army to wander about through mountain forest a did last time to ensure that must ere long fall back at daybreak next morning set out rode to welshpool being walled town population almost entirely english must leave horse here in safety first went to governor upon be explaining that be bearer of letter for king asking whether must give information a to direction have best take shook head news have come hither for last five day said herd of bullock arrived here three day since be to have be forwarded on to army welsh be out in force road beset party have come down from hill overlooking have fired several house escaped when last attacked force be sufficient to hold town against attack can not spare so many men a must be required to convoy cattle told king so before went on said that welshman must dare show when army have once passed on that welsh house village must be destroyed within put to sword so must have difficulty in sending forward cattle other supply that village have be destroyed have doubt for messenger who came in from llanfair told that a passed over hill must see smoke rising from forest in direction whether inhabitant remained quietly awaiting arrival of troop be more than doubtful there be beacon fire on hill night before army left shrewsbury again on next night since then have seen more from here who came from llanfair told that be burning on hill night got there so have doubt that old men woman child be at once sent off probably to shelter in plinlimmon district mayhap in forest of cader idris at rate may be sure that very few will be found at village be so last time king army marched along same when made way through denbigh to anglesey welsh care little for burning of house take two three day work to rebuild harrying of village will not bring matter day nearer to conclusion be by destroying castle house of better class that effect will be produced peasant have little to lose welsh gentry have house estate fear of losing may drive to abandon glendower to come over to many did so after king last invasion methinks best policy must be to spare villager give peasant cause for complaint to war only against leader a to sir there be not most remote chance of getting through have best wait here until army return levy who may have arrived late at shrewsbury come up on way to join king inquired at shrewsbury last night sir heard that more party be expected contingent from county having joined king at worcester on day ordered intention be that man at arm will leave horse here go forward on foot in way can travel for most part through forest may escape being seen have already left armour behind at ludlow so a to be able to move more rapidly be northumbrians be accustomed to traverse moor fell even must be seen by straggling party of enemy will have fair chance of outrunning throwing off track at rate be duty to endeavour to carry letter to king be matter of life death know not sir royal messenger brought from london to ludlow have ridden with relay of horse have mean of getting farther begged sir edmund mortimer to forward esquire of sir henry percy be staying a guest with sir edmund who be a know lord brother in law volunteered to carry being anxious to have opportunity of doing service to king be bold offer young man doubtless when made be scarce aware how dangerous be business that undertook did think that must be of use must furnish with twenty men at arm to ride with know force must in way add to safety might get a far a llanidloes llanfair whichever route might choose though think not that must do so beyond that must be hopeless for force of le than five hundred good fighting men to attempt to make way through from what hear there be at least fifteen thousand welshman in arm many doubtless be with glendower rest will be scattered among hill ready to pounce upon party who may be moving up valley to join king there be plenty of place where couple of hundred men must check advance of army then be more necessary sir that must trust to good fortune to making way unseen may pray to take care of horse till return to claim must never do so there be doubtless many upon whom must bestow be rarely good animal for one be presented to by sir henry percy other by sir edmund mortimer will take care of willingly if return before king march back find when come that did not reach will use horse holding always a property must at time return to claim be there aught else that can do to help sir what must of other thing be most valuable to must be guide from what have seen heard of welsh fear that reliance can be placed on one of certainly not at present did take one must slip away at first opportunity there be englishman so far a know who must guide through mountain in case sir must perforce travel close to road so a to be sure that wander from track keeping in shelter of forest be only possible course governor agreed to be lost among hill must be certain death if failed to fall in with anyone must die of hunger if did meet anyone must be killed glendower spare englishman who fall into hand know that can be greatly blamed for sir oswald said with smile seeing that welsh meet with such scant mercy from 't be savage war governor said shrugging shoulder seems to that will continue until last welshman be exterminated that will be difficult thing indeed to effect oswald laughed a difficult a be extermination of wolf in england hope that matter will arrange long before surely in time welsh leader will see that struggle be hopeless one that will lose home possession life if continue brave a welsh may be can not withstand whole strength of england may exist in forest for time with valley fertile land in english hand will at last be forced to submit must seem so edward said same thing of scotland carried fire sword through time after time yet scotland have still king hold own on border be so sir scotland be large country whereas wale be small one town castle be english a be port people although brave be wholly without discipline be able to fight only in mountain while scot be strong enough to give battle to on level ground have defeated more than once advice to be to leave town at night governor said a oswald rose to leave there may be many of welsh lying round now doubtless learn from countryman here be doing will give scroll ordering that be allowed to pas out at time by night day thank sir have intended to start tomorrow morning two hour before daybreak so a to get well into forest before sunrise will of course go first to llanidloes where doubtless strong guard will have be left a far a can not well miss way a will have to keep along side of valley be so beyond that river be mere streamlet will have to make across hill do know sir whether force went to llanfair be to effect junction with king believe not at rate not for present party be to march west king force be to move south of plinlimmon lord talbot to cross range of hill come down upon river dovey if possible prevent glendower if be still on plinlimmon from making way to dinas mowddwy cader idris up to snowdon again plan be doubtless a good a doubt whether talbot force if ten time a numerous a be must prevent glendower from slipping away that evening oswald bought supply of bread meat sufficient to last roger for three day be divided in half placed in bag must be slung over shoulder horse have already be sent up to castle after sleeping for few hour two left town turning to right ascended hill oswald carried sword dagger roger in addition to have heavy oaken quarterstaff said may be of service in mountain work may suffice to crack skull of half dozen welshman may fall in with have put on plain leather jerkin cloth cap wore underneath own suit with percy cognizance embroidered on in order that might present in proper attire must arrive at king camp weather be already becoming cold double suit be therefore not uncomfortable a dress of welsh in town valley be very similar to worn by english villager must attract little attention must have cause to take to road for short distance keeping within edge of belt of tree followed valley down past ruin of montgomery passed newtown without entering many time during morning heard loud shout from wood in be answered by similar cry from other side of valley be obliged to move with great caution for be evident that considerable number of welsh be in ambush in wood in readiness to attack party who might be proceeding up down valley towards noon be obliged to leave edge of forest to ascend to brow of hill a be certain that party of enemy who might be in forest must be assembled near edge in readiness to pour suddenly down more than once heard voice short distance away paused for time to allow party of men to cross ahead of greatest danger lay in crossing side valley a welsh must be expecting one to come down succeeded in crossing without being observed be well content when just a night be falling came down upon llanidloes crossing wooden bridge over stream entered town boldly for looking down upon have seen many men in armour in street knew that place be occupied by english at gate at end of bridge be asked business replied that must only answer to officer commanding be taken before whence come friend latter said surely must be english by height what be doing here in time like present know not come from king army from north left welshpool before daybreak oswald said have travelled through forest then must be a bold a be tall sir for wood be full of wild welsh of be aware sir have difficulty in making way through unobserved must not answer guard when entered for be going farther have be mentioned in hearing of welshman news might have be sent on ahead think not that can reach king when last heard foremost division be marching forward devastating country on side of line of march have heard report that of party have be attacked well nigh destroyed certain be that glendower men be scattered over country be three day without news morning strong party came in escorting sick wounded have to fight hard beat off opponent got in with loss of third of number have started at night fortunately arrived within five mile of here before be attacked where be king now sir king be at capel bangor army lie between place yspetty cynfyn then 't be day march from here must be short day march must follow road must be impossible to do so for 't be beset everywhere be so rough hilly that in place men at arm have to dismount will have to wait here till large force set out with provision for who came in declare that will not attempt to return so great be number of welshman along there so fierce reckless be have not yet told who be why must push on to army thus rashly oswald opened jerkin showed handsome attire beneath embroidered with percy cognizance be esquire of sir henry percy said have be staying for while with sir edmund mortimer whose sister be lord wife royal messenger arrived at ludlow with letter for king a there be other way of bringing forward volunteered to carry with man at arm here be brave offer young sir fear that will scarce be able to carry into effect men who came here report that be unsafe to stir yard from camp for who wander away for however short distance be sure to be slain by lurking welshman resistance be offered when strong party go out le than two hundred men at arm can not hope to move unattacked 't be for reason have come on foot oswald said saw that must be hopeless for two horseman to get through on foot may travel through wood without being discovered while if be seen methinks must need speedy foot to catch well since bear royal letter can not stop seems to that chance of getting through be small indeed chapter knighted rain be coming down in torrent when oswald roger started next morning on leaving town turned to left with intention of making considerable detour keeping well away from road a be near that welsh must be most likely watching chose side because to right of road country be more broken rising swell after swell towards plinlimmon be likely that largest portion of welsh must be on side so that must at time retire to fastness be soon in wood stream met with be turbid full to brim will have trouble with water roger oswald said a waded across one waist deep be little stream if there be larger one a be like enough will have to swim before be done there be one advantage in such weather a even welsh will scarce be active have not got much clothing to wet roger said dress be better suited than ours for such weather way be rough one hill although of great height have to be crossed many stream to be waded fortunately met with few larger than that have first crossed for water from side of hill made way for most part direct into severn while came down from slope of plinlimmon towards road fell into stream dry in fine weather now raging torrent ran past llandulas into severn at llanidloes do think that be going right roger oswald said after have be walking for six seven hour for what with ups down turning winding there be saying be east be west if sun be shining must be sure of direction with dull leaden cloud there be saying have idea master if be out on moor must be able to judge to make fairly straight course keeping wind rain on one side of in thick forest though most of leaf have fallen remain on branch break up rain seems to come straight down upon presently came to watercourse why roger water be going in other direction so be master how can that be be just possible that have crossed dividing point water be making way towards south will fall into other river be very much afraid that real explanation be that have entirely lost way be going in opposite direction to in started question be will cross will follow down just a like roger said for think that best way must be to find place where must shelter tomorrow sun may be out again will tell way to go if start at daybreak keep to back ca go far wrong except that may pas army altogether roger told that rearmost division be not more than ten mile ahead must have walked double that already must say master not so much a that have be long time over be slow travelling over broken ground thick wood be sure hope that have not gone twenty mile anything like for in case if have be keeping fairly in right direction must have passed army if have be going in wrong direction there be saying where may be still think that suggestion be good one be of use going on when may be getting farther away at step be lucky that bought thick cloak at welshpool for without must have be soaked to skin hour ago well a have be wetted to waist score of time in stream see that must have mattered much if rest of have be wet through well now let look for shelter after searching for hour found spot where wall of shaly rock barred way at one spot of have fallen in forming sort of willow cave three foot deep be not bad beginning roger must try make great deal more snug first cut down young fir pole placed so a to form sort of penthouse against wall on piled number of branch of same tree until be over foot in thickness so far so good oswald said now roger look about for fallen tree have passed score on way must get thoroughly rotten one cut away portion of under side will be dry enough there might get little of to start with roger said ground be covered everywhere with fir cone there be better stuff for fire taking off cloak laid down piled fir cone on until great heap be collected carried into shelter through opening have left in penthouse must have something dry to start with cone be great deal too wet to burn without good heat to start there be nothing better than fir needle master if can find dry one after searching considerable number of needle be collected lying under fallen tree others swept by wind into rocky corner where rain have not reached now think that will do roger a soon a be inside roger produced large lump of dry fungus have found on other side of severn by aid of flint steel soon succeeded in striking spark upon a soon a began to spread put little pile of fir needle on blowing gently bright flame soon darted up few more handful of fuel be added fir cone placed at top in quarter of hour clear bright fire be burning dripping cloak be hung up to fir pole to dry jerkin be also damp although water have not penetrated through be spread near fire be well that bought little skin of wine last night roger said thought be better to be without such burden weight of gallon of wine doe count for much make difference in comfort here rain have soaked through provision bag bread meat in centre be dry of made hearty meal laying wetted food round fire to dry wound up repast with long draught of wine now a soon a breech be dry master oswald will be thoroughly comfortable yes one can wish for nothing better must not forget that welshman may come along if so will be sure to want to know what be inside then unless there happen to be more than dozen of curiosity may cost dear roger said grimly think there be much fear of have seen heard of since started must be evil fortune indeed if party happened to come along just at spot fact that have heard one be bad sign roger for must seem to show that must have gone long way out of course rain continued to fall heavily afternoon throughout night change of weather be discernible next morning have best stop here for day roger unless sky clear be not likely to find so good place for shelter be of use to wander about when step may be taking farther away however can climb up to top of hill at whose foot be endeavour to get view over country roger shook head in heavy mist must not see quarter of mile away have got clothes dry now must be pity to get wet again without need profit anyhow will find more of fir cone supply be nearly gone in hour have got sufficient to last day there be nothing for then to do sleep one other keeping watch so a to prevent chance of being surprised before lying down for night roger looked out methinks that rain have stopped though must be difficult to say for drop keep pattering down from tree well mightily hope that will be fine morning oswald be first upon foot on going out uttered exclamation of satisfaction morning be breaking though light cloud be moving across sky glimpse of blue be visible here there already light showed where sun must presently rise food be hastily eaten then started on way again there must be mistake now a to general direction keeping sun on right hand made way north from top of hill somewhat higher than others caught view of plinlimmon if make straight for oswald said ought to come down on road near camp can go on fearlessly for time for welsh be hardly likely to be moving about yesterday day before have doubt sheltered a best must in arbour like ours after walking for two hour heard distant sound of trumpet can not be more than two three mile away roger now will have to be careful have walked mile when a descended into glen came suddenly on party of twenty welshman sitting round fire have be concealed from by thick undergrowth be not twenty yard away when first saw welsh have evidently heard coming by rustle of leaf breaking of twig two three be standing up looking in direction when caught sight of gave loud yell brought rest to foot run roger run be question of leg now turning darted up hill have just descended looking back for moment a after running for about mile reached crest of swell oswald saw that five of pursuer have distanced comrade be nearer than when started think can hold roger take little more easily now be all right a far a speed go be simply question of bottom pursuer however still stuck to after running for half mile five men be still thirty yard behind while comrade shout must be heard through forest from time to time men close behind joined in loud quavering cry must stand rid ourselves of fellow roger will have welsh nation down on so have be thinking for time stop suddenly will slacken pace will think that strength be failing will redouble effort then when be close to will turn suddenly heard yell of exultation a pursuer found that be gaining upon choose clear space roger with room to swing weapon welsh be running in close body ten yard behind when arrived at spot clear of tree now roger a spoke oswald drew sword swung round facing pursuer while roger did same welsh taken by surprise endeavoured to check before must do so roger staff fell upon head of one of while oswald cleft to chin with quickness of adroit player with quarterstaff roger followed up blow by almost instantaneously driving other end of staff with force against chest of who be at point of leaping upon man fell a if struck with thunderbolt so swift have be movement that remaining two men be paralysed by sudden fall of companion before must turn to fly weapon descended again with a fatal result a before to right oswald exclaimed dashed off into forest again at right angle to line that have before taken minute later heard outburst of yell of fury from spot have quitted think will be quite so ready to follow now roger said be like to be time before take up track again will break into walk in few minute roger then go along quietly keep ear open yell will be bringing others down from direction might run right into middle of party if kept on at rate in five minute dashed down steep descent at whose foot streamlet swelled now into rushing stream five six foot wide be running will follow down oswald said a stepped into be little over two foot deep waded along for couple of hundred yard then stepped out where rock cropped out by side of stream have not yet dried after rain foot therefore left mark on be sharp run roger oswald said a with rapid stealthy step strode along ay be breath be coming short when gave word to stop half mile must have finished welshman run well have doubt must have beaten easily enough on open ground roger be more accustomed to forest work than be mind where tread put foot on fallen stick there must be score of in forest behind yet though think that have struck track nearest must be quarter of mile away be not afraid of overtaking be risk of falling in with other party that be afraid of now bore away to right again more than once heard party moving near stood quiet until voice died away quickly did a be hurrying towards spot whence shouting still continued for hour kept straight onward then tree thinned a stepped out from edge of forest saw to delight few tent in front of large number of soldier scattered about a be seen of soldier caught up arm when saw that two men be approaching laid down again proceeded with work on most of be engaged in polishing up arm armour whose brightness have be grievously dimmed by rain sub officer with four men came up to a reached line who be sir asked be esquire of sir henry percy have brought letter for king man looked doubtfully at continued not whether earl of talbot be in camp if so will think recognize earl arrived with five hundred of men yesterday officer said with tone of more respect than have before used will take to tent led way to tent pitched short distance away from before royal standard waved oswald took off cloak be rolled up over shoulder handed to roger then opened jerkin a came up to tent front opened earl came out whom have here asked officer have just come out of forest lord gentleman asked to be taken to saying that must recognize earl looked scrutinizingly at oswald seem to know face sir said can not recall where have seen name be oswald forster esquire of sir henry percy joined at chester lord talbot with band of men of sir edmund mortimer led by one of knight remember now earl said yes see wear percy badge how have got here why have come come a simple messenger lord royal courier arrived at ludlow with letter from london for king majesty have laid command on sir edmund mortimer that be not to weaken force by single lance a for aught sir edmund knew letter might be of great importance volunteered to endeavour to carry through taking with only man at arm on whom must wholly rely might happen having accompanied on more than one dangerous expedition sir edmund consented rode first to shrewsbury to obtain information a to course king have taken at welshpool left horse behind thinking easier to make way through wood on foot seeing that road be said to be beset by welsh so reached llanidloes then hearing where king be then posted from convoy of wounded that have be brought in day who have be attacked very hardly treated a came along thought to make detour through wood so a to get behind welshman who might be watching road unfortunately in storm of rain having guide lost way be so detained near two day in forest morning weather having changed sun come out learned direction that must take on way fell in with party of twenty welshman who pursued hotly outran five a shout must have brought large number upon stopped slew though search be hot for succeeded in making way through without adventure until came out from forest close by truly be adventure of great peril earl said for welsh be swarming round though see nought of when be once in saddle assuredly must never have got through even a far a llanidloes if have followed road on horseback for last party came along brought word that welsh have felled tree across in many place have broken down bridge be gallant exploit sir will myself take in to king oswald took off jerkin be in poor plight to show before majesty said a handed to roger ah remember good fellow earl said be not one easily forgotten for 't be seldom one see so stout man at arm a to dress 't be nought indeed be in better order than most in camp for soldier have tent have for last forty eight hour be over ankle in mud water have be with mortimer ever since harried glendower valley lord returned after to north be at alnwick for nine month then sir henry sent back again to ludlow in order might keep well informed of extent of rebellion concerning few tidings came to have by time arrived at entrance of king tent two sentry on duty there stood back saluted a earl entered followed by oswald sire be messenger one master oswald forster esquire of sir henry percy have be sent by lord to ludlow to keep acquainted with extent of rebellion few day since royal messenger reached town with letter for a doubtless in london can not have known way be marching directed there so that might be forwarded to thence sir edmund having royal order not to send force away must have be at loss how to forward deeming that must need strong body of men at arm to penetrate to a knew from what have happened on two last expedition that welsh being unable to oppose advance must swarm behind so a to prevent reinforcement convoy of provision from reaching be therefore doubtful a to what course to adopt when gentleman volunteered to carry to have accomplished attended by single follower knowing that must only hope to reach on foot man at arm left horse at welshpool have made way through wood on foot not without adventure having lost way in storm having slept in wood for two day killed five welshman scarcely escaping crowd of others a came in very gallant deed sir king said to oswald a latter bent upon one knee handed letter to by lady be slight thing to venture through wood swarming with wild welshman how long have be esquire to percy over three year sire met master forster at chester earl said commanded score of percy men rode with when captured glendower house knight with told that little band have done excellent service in fight when welsh made first irruption that sir henry percy have written in warmest term to mortimer saying that gentleman stood high in regard that have most perfect confidence in have selected for service since be able to write well must therefore communicate freely with a to trouble on welsh border have be at mortimer ever since time king asked oswald noticed that time mortimer name be mentioned king brow be somewhat clouded not so majesty returned to north with percy men few day after capture of glendower house came back to ludlow in spring why did sir henry percy despatch there again king asked sharply from what said sire be because be anxious to know whether rebellion be growing fearing that there might be correspondence between glendower scot that if must come to point when might have to lead whole force of south to put welsh down scot might make great irruption into northern county must be needful for to keep larger body of men than usual under arm a earl father earl of westmoreland must have to stand whole brunt of matter for time without aid from south king brow cleared be thoughtful act of sir henry said be like enough that scot will a say take advantage of trouble here be well therefore that lord of northern march must hold in readiness what think talbot seems to that bold service esquire have performed merit reward think so indeed earl said be singular act of courage king drew sword from scabbard kneel sir said a oswald knelt king laid sword across shoulder said rise sir oswald forster oswald rose thank lord king said trust may live for many year to do worthy knightly service to liege who have so highly honoured lord king said to talbot leave to to see that young knight be provided with horse armour unfortunately there be more than one suit without owner at present will do well to wait with while open letter maybe contains matter of moment feeling that audience be over oswald bowed deeply left tent to rejoin roger said king master spoke much more highly of what have done roger than deserved a reward for service have just knighted think that have done well master roger exclaimed joyously have hoped that hotspur must have done after adventure with bairds of a alwyn told spoke to in tone of wondrous praise be private business roger must know must much rather that when knighthood came must receive for service in field king regard coming here a service to therefore rewarded must rather that must have be for service in field against enemy than for tramping through forest yes forest full of welshman roger said who be more to be feared in way than when met in open fight earl talbot spoke very kindly of said that have heard that with percy men have done good service in fight with welsh near knighton be certainly pretty hot work master will get to say sir oswald in time at present tongue be not used to be to do now king asked lord talbot to provide with armour horse so must wait until come way be hour before earl came out letter be of importance said be well that be brought on now sir oswald let see to matter two day ago sir william baxter be killed by sudden attack of welsh while be burning village men rallied beat off welsh brought body in methinks armour will fit though be shorter by two three inch than accompanied to one of small group of tent standing quarter of mile farther down road be sir william baxter squire here young man at once came up be esquire lord have king order earl said that arm armour horse be to be handed over forthwith to sir oswald forster here who will take command of troop will take over other belonging of knight young squire bowed will hand over to sir will of course take possession of tent also sir oswald sir william be one of knight be unwedded have male kin therefore need have hesitation in taking belonging indeed must in case have little chance of taking back with for waggon be few will daily become fewer for on such road a waggon horse break down will be a much a can do to carry even necessity with come to tent at noon lack hour of will present at dinner to of knight among whom for present will rank so saying turned away young squire held open entrance of tent for oswald to enter followed in seems strange thing to be thus possessed of man good said be often so squire said sometimes even estate go with also a earl said sir william baxter have none to whom thing must have be given seeing that have so far a know only one sister to whom armour horse must be of use be one of countess of talbot lady what be going to do for present know not squire said have be with sir william baxter three year knight served with before be thrown from horse killed sir william who have be just knighted took into service how long have be squire six year hoped that in campaign might have done something to win spur be poor knight master paused henry pemberton squire said being knighted today having land to keep up knighthood may be that earl will appoint to of knight must not do so will be glad if for rest of campaign will ride with trust that too may have opportunity of gaining knighthood before be over whether a soon a cross border again doubt not that will be able to find lord under whom may gain advancement will gladly do so sir oswald 't be strange must not have seen face before for since left worcester have come to know greater part of esquire here arrived hour ago oswald replied having made way through welsh on foot with tall fellow saw without be dangerous deed truly pemberton said in tone of surprise may ask why essayed so perilous feat be bearer of despatch for king be esquire to sir henry percy have for time be staying with brother in law sir edmund mortimer have sir william man at arm who served a servant for will make man at arm who have gone through many adventure with have fought by side saved life second squire yes very good trusty fellow then of course will keep on now will tell man to come in roger said doubtless earl word be now master of tent together with armour horse clothes of sir william baxter master henry pemberton will act a squire during campaign will be second squire well master never looked so high a to become esquire must rather remain simple man at arm be not that will keep near will find roger good comrade master pemberton have be man at arm at own choice for a can read write a well a clerk might have done better for pemberton looked with surprise at roger have not accomplishment be surprised at finding man at arm so well endowed a may tell by speech went on be like northumbrian have done good service in war with scot can well imagine squire said with smile must certainly wish for stouter comrade must see about arm armour for roger oswald said there will be difficulty about none sir oswald have lost fully three hundred men since crossed border hundred fifty since came here four day since there be pile of harness arm lying by roadside there methinks be likely will lie have to go with when have attired buckled on spur can pick choose among assuredly one will gainsay oswald now changed attire clothes be handsome fitted well then buckled on golden spur put on knightly armour for have observed that earl knight that have seen in camp kept on full armour being ever in expectation of sudden attack truly make handsome figure sir oswald said roger who have be assisting little did think when used to rail at at book that must grow into so stalwart man must follow in field a squire armour fit a if made for save that cuishes scarce meet body armour in truth though bad for be lucky for that master of tent came to death when did like steel cap better than helmet though say not that look so well not by long way roger said nought must become better what cognizance do mean to take have not thought about yet there will be time enough for after war be over well at rate master will today set about getting sir william baxter off shield methinks with sand from river bed will be able to manage with hour rubbing now come along roger there be time to be lost for dine at midday with earl of talbot master pemberton will show where armour be lying there be indeed large pile oswald then said a be known master pemberton have better stop here for will take picking before roger be suited a be two minute to twelve must hurry back to lord talbot tent seven eight knight be already there lord talbot introduced to a dined oswald related at request more particularly how have got through welsh task seemed to well nigh impossible since soldier dared not venture even to edge of forest so thickly be welsh posted there that man at arm must be stalwart fellow indeed said one to kill three welshman with nought quarterstaff if have seen man staff sir victor must not be surprised lord talbot said stand six foot four have shoulder might rival samson a to quarterstaff marked be of oak full two inch across blow with from such arm must crack iron casque to say nothing of welsh skull chapter glendower for next ten day weather be so bad that operation must be carried on little stream be swollen to raging torrent horse carrying men in full armour must scarce keep foot on slippery moor even footman have greatest difficulty in getting about excursion be given up for welsh barefooted unweighted with armour must have be able to fall upon to great advantage must then evade pursuit with ease number of sick increased rapidly became necessary to send convoy back to llanidloes where guard be to join force have gone there ten day before to escort waggon of flour number of cattle have be brought there from welshpool by strong levy from shropshire ten knight hundred mounted men at arm a many on foot fifty archer be considered sufficient to escort sick who to number of two hundred be closely packed in ten waggon be to return with flour three of lord talbot knight be to form part of escort among oswald be chosen by earl be hoped that convoy must reach town without being attacked for great pain have be taken to prevent news of approaching departure getting about for there be many welshman in camp employed in looking after baggage animal in other office have be hired for service on other side of border be believed that of at least must be in communication with enemy who be thereby enabled to gather in force to oppose party who sallied out from camp consequence be that until hour before left none save few of leader be aware of starting of convoy then order be rapidly issued knight men at arm who have be selected for service have few minute to prepare horse be harnessed to waggon sick wounded carried out placed in with greatest expedition party set out in le than hour after first order have be given have gone quarter of mile when shout among wood on side showed that welsh be vigilant horn be blown in direction sound growing fainter fainter in hill will not get through undisturbed one of knight said to oswald who be riding next to think will have fighting must have be better have men at arm be told to leave horse behind in deep soil will be of little use in fight must do better on foot must be terrible marching in heavy armour doubtless must have be so must not have minded that distance be six mile although in slippery plain toil must have be great methinks that must have made better fight than on horseback a waggon travel slowly must have kept up with can dismount if necessary knight said for part must rather ride than tramp through deep mud progress be indeed slow waggon frequently sank almost up to axle in mud needed effort of dismounted men to get out deep silence have succeeded outcry in wood like not silence sir oswald knight said when after hour hard work be still two mile from camp do oswald said seems unnatural do not think sir william that must be well if be to take picket rope from horse neck knot two two fastening one end to waggon other to horse girth in way fifty men at arm might be roped on to waggon must aid drawing greatly idea be very good one knight said rode forward to sir eustace de bohun who be in command informed of oswald suggestion be at once adopted a soon a be carried out dismounted men be ordered to push behind waggon now proceeded at much faster rate than before be just half way to town beginning to entertain hope that must get through without being attacked when horn sounded from forest on side crowd of men rushed out poured volley of arrow into convoy hasty order be shouted by sir eustace rope be thrown off troop formed up in double line on side of waggon knight mounted men formed outside line footman stood pace two behind so a to cover from attack must welsh break through oswald esquire be on one side of roger on other waggon continued to move forward for at point road be better running across bare rock horse be therefore able to draw along without assistance sir eustace therefore gave order for escort to continue way marching on side of train must fight way through men shouted minute will doubtless add to number for short time arrow flew fast welsh bow be not to be compared in point of strength with used by english archer arrow fell harmlessly upon armour of men at arm while on other hand english archer shot so strongly truly that after short time welsh bowman fell back a did so however crowd of footman poured out from forest with loud shout yell rushed forward halt waggon sir eustace cried keep good order men will soon drive rabble off archer have time to send three flight of arrow among assailant when threw upon line be armed with short ax heavy club other rough weapon for time horseman kept order beat back a horn continued to sound welsh swarmed down in such number that broke in between mounted foe trying to tear from saddle while others crept beneath horse drove long knife into stomach tried to hamstring with ax then dismounted men at arm joined in fight drove enemy back beyond line many of horseman be however dismounted joined mounted comrade when sir eustace gave word to charge multitude before must rally for fresh attack welsh went down in number before lance so close be throng that horseman be brought to stand slinging spear behind betook to sword mace great be slaughter of opponent pursued former tactic horse after horse rolled over in mortal agony a fell rider be stabbed before must recover foot soon be broken up into knot dismounted companion with one accord left waggon rushed into fray for time beating back welsh be best to dismount oswald cried swung from saddle just a one of enemy hamstrung horse roger squire did same joined rank of footman keep together oswald shouted to within hearing can cut passage through in way while separately will perish ten twelve men followed order gathering in ring for time beat off attack looking round oswald saw that scarce man remained mounted shout of english wild war cry of welsh rang through air in dozen place fierce contest be raging sword ax rose fell on helmet steel cap in obedience to shout of sir eustace who with three four men at arm around be still mounted english band tried to join other in several case succeeded oswald have be near rear of convoy when fight began party with whom fought be separated by distance from others prospect became more more hopeless squire have fallen fully men who have joined although loss of welsh have be many time a great number of assailant have in way diminished roger strove in vain to cut way through height strength enabled to maintain forward movement opponent shrinking from terrible blow of roger mace le destructive fall of oswald sword men at arm behind fared worse having to retreat with face to foe more than one falling over body of slain by leader be stabbed before must rise several time two men turned covered rear at last stood alone now make one effort to break through roger flung with such fury upon welsh for twenty yard cut way through then roger exclaimed be done for master fell oswald stood over for time kept clear circle then received tremendous blow on back of helmet with heavy club fell prostrate over roger when recovered sens din of battle have moved far away other group have gathered together moving down have joined who still resisted on other side of road keeping in close body be fighting way steadily along number of welsh be going over battlefield stabbing whom found to be still living sick men in waggon have already be murdered welshman whose appearance denoted higher rank than others approached oswald a soon a sat up called to four five of countryman oswald with difficulty rose to foot still wore round wrist chain that glendower daughter have given now pulled off held up loudly calling out name of glendower several time welsh leader waved follower back oswald be unarmed evidently incapable of defending came up to oswald held out chain glendower glendower repeated man took chain examined carefully welsh word be engraved upon clasp oswald be unaware what be word be jane glendower from father welshman looked much surprised presently called to distance away man came up spoke to in welsh how did obtain man asked oswald in english be given in token of service rendered by squire here to glendower daughter told that must be of service if at time be taken prisoner by father follower be translated to welshman who said men must be taken to glendower story may be true not chain may have be stolen at rate prince must decide a to fate now bade men round take off oswald armour a soon a be done latter knelt down by roger side removed helmet arrow shot from behind have struck roger just above back piece being short for did not reach to helmet have gone through fleshy part of neck while at same moment blow with axe have cleft helmet in sunder inflicted deep gash on back of head at word from leader men at once aided oswald who drew out arrow wound bled slightly one of welshman tearing off portion of garment bandaged up water be fetched from stream below pad of wet cloth laid on wound at back of head kept in place by bandage a be done roger gave faint groan minute after opened eye try to move roger oswald said be wounded not trust to death be prisoner in hand of welsh chain glendower daughter gave have saved life rough litter be constructed of bough on roger after armour have be taken off be laid at leader order six welshman took up while two placed one on side of oswald then leader took head of party moved away into forest oswald head still swam from effect of blow a went on feeling gradually ceased be able to keep up with captor course be ever uphill after hour walking arrived at farmhouse situated just at upper edge of forest litter be laid down outside house welshman went in saying something to men who at once sat down on ground for journey with roger weight have be toilsome one made sign for oswald to seat by side of roger latter be now perfectly sensible what have happened master asked have be badly beaten roger when last saw men have got together be fighting way along road fancy more than half have be killed a far a must see of field must say that three four time a many welsh have fallen that be lucky thought of yours sir oswald about chain have always idea that might be found useful at once occurred to a soon a recovered sens be wounded too roger asked anxiously be beaten down by heavy club head still ring from blow otherwise be uninjured what have happened to master have arrow through neck roger fortunately be on one side inch to right must have struck spine perhaps gone through windpipe a be doe not seem to have done much harm very little blood flowed when pulled arrow out have got bad gash on back of head head piece broke force of blow have laid skull bare have not so far a can see penetrated then need think more about roger said well be fight one have at knighton be a nothing to yes think that even must not want harder one roger be quite enough for one day work must like drink of water if must get one oswald made sign to one of men who went into house returned with large jug of water of roger took deep draught oswald then finished content for too be parched with thirst hour later tall man in full armour followed by number of welsh chief issued from forest be five forty year old of noble presence leader of party who have brought oswald up advanced to meet saluting most respectfully spoke to for moment then produced chain glendower for be prince examined then at once walked up to oswald who have risen to foot how became possessed of sir knight be given by one of daughter sir squire here be on guard round house on night after earl of talbot took be at distance from other guard when two figure rose from bush near pursued coming up to found be two lady at once avowed that be daughter instruction be to watch see that welshman approached house nought have be said to of arresting leaving seeing that be not supposed that be there war not with woman being from northumbria have enmity with people therefore let proceed on way breach of duty for doubtless must have suffered have be known happily none follower here who be then man at arm squire knew of to moment have spoken of to one a left one of lady gave chain saying that day might be of use to must ever fall into hand of people have carried on wrist ever since when follower came up saw necessity have arisen showed to have heard story from daughter glendower said warmly holding out hand told how courteously have treated that have refused to accept jewel offered said that have also declined to tell name a might do injury must become known have often regretted that did not know name of gentleman who have behaved so nobly to have saved from english prison have be captured must have be sore blow to not only in affection to cause for have held in power henry must have put heavy pressure upon may ask now what be name sir knight sir oswald forster be at time squire of sir henry percy of hotspur glendower said in surprise did not know that have levy from north fighting against have not sir have simply be sent with twenty men at arm by sir henry to sir edmund mortimer who be a be doubtless aware of kin to sir henry who have married sister be sent by sir edmund to join earl of talbot lord grey when made that foray upon house after returned to north be month since again sent to ludlow to keep sir henry informed of doings on border have heard that mortimer have sent no troop to henry army be so sir be here by accident despatch came from london to ludlow for king a there be other way of forwarding volunteered to carry here succeeded in doing so for service king conferred knighthood upon upon arrival ten day since ah then be that heard of be told that two great men have be seen in wood distance south of camp that have succeeded in making escape after slaying five of follower that though none knew for certain be supposed have reached henry camp be right two men be companion here be notable feat think not that other messenger have got through scout since king left welshpool must be swift of foot a well a brave courteous for heard that have outrun greatest part of who followed in north have to be swift of foot oswald said with smile for scot keep in practice in escaping when come in too great force to be resisted in following when be turn to pursue trust sir that will put squire to ransom will take word for payment for until go north have mean of satisfying will not glendower said rather will take ransom since be to release without one might cause surprise inquiry be well that noble conduct to daughter must not be known for henry must not be likely to regard favourably therefore will put to ransom at sum of crown for penny for squire thank indeed sir will ever feel beholden to will moreover give knightly word that service may have to perform will never again war with welsh may ask if of party succeeded in reaching llanidloes yes sixty seventy of got in fought very well indeed in close combat welshman can not at present hold own against armour clad men still though must have pleased better have annihilated force success have be sufficient to give henry lesson though may march through wale hold only ground on have encamped now sir oswald pray to enter abode 't be poor place indeed after house in vale of bard suffices for need before entering gave order that roger must be carried to upper room despatched messenger to order own leech a soon a have done with wounded to come up attend to then led way into room where meal be prepared in few word in welsh explained to chief who have be much surprised at manner in have received oswald that young knight have at one time rendered great service to daughter jane margaret without mentioning precise nature experience have taught that even most attached to cause might yet turn against be to relate story might do serious injury to oswald must on way back said presently to young knight call see daughter who be at present staying with sister who be married to adda ap iorwerth ddu must be aggrieved indeed if heard that have be here have not given opportunity of thanking in person oswald remained for fortnight with glendower while roger wound be healing at end of time learned that henry having marched into cardigan ravaged country there be already retiring army having suffered terribly from effect of weather impossibility of obtaining supply constant harassing attack by welsh glendower be often absent when at house conversed freely with oswald who be no longer surprised at influence that have obtained over countryman manner be courteous in extreme authority over follower absolute not only reverenced a prince representative of ancient king leader in war a one endowed with supernatural power bard have fanned feeling to utmost by song of marvel portent at birth by attributing to control even over element belief be not only of great importance to a binding adherent closer to undoubtedly contributed to success from fact of being fully shared in by english soldiery who assigned a cause of exceptionally bad weather have be experienced in of three expedition into country of failure to accomplish anything of importance against side of character of glendower puzzled oswald several time when talking to distinctly claimed supernatural power from tone in spoke strange expression face at time assumed oswald be convinced that sincerely believed that did posse power whether originally did so whether have arisen from adulation of bard general belief in success have gained oswald must not determine later when glendower sullied fair fame by most atrocious massacre similar to have already taken place at storming of new radnor atrocity seemed not only purposeless at utter variance with courtesy gentleness of bearing oswald came to believe that brain have to extent become unhinged by excitement flattery superstition at end of fortnight roger wound although not completely healed be in such state that permitted sitting on horseback oswald became anxious to be off glendower who be about to set out to harass rear of army a retired from cardiganshire at once offered to send strong escort with a must have be dangerous in extreme to have attempted to traverse country without protection two excellent horse have be captured in engagement with english be handed over to for own use that of roger oswald own armour be returned to be pleased to find that have be carefully attended to be a brightly burnished a when came into possession when glendower bid adieu presented of with ring similar to wore have promised that will not fight against again may be that on errand other may ride into wale that may be staying a did before at castle town near border when attack have to show ring to welshman may come across may be sure of being well

a to that roger remember that story be have be put at knightly ransom on condition will never serve in wale again when once get across border will ride straight for northumberland without going near ludlow observed that king much doubted mortimer be to return there news came to ear might take a proof that there be understanding between glendower mortimer that be to leniency such a have be shown to other prisoner be due whereas if go straight to percy 't be not likely that matter will ever come to hearing at rate if did so must scarce connect mortimer with escape understand sir oswald will

that be strange so happened after staying day there continued journey to regret of lady who be glad to hear that must never again fight against welsh escort accompanied a near border a be safe for to go next day rode into chester then by easy stage up to alnwick oswald went to hotspur apartment a soon a entered castle congratulate heartily hotspur said a entered see that have won spur said to myself when received letter saying that be starting to carry letter to king that enterprise must bring death pair of gold spur be glad indeed to see that be latter hear that king army be falling back messenger brought news from kinsman said that be rumour have reached that seemed likely enough for be said that have suffered terribly from weather attack of welsh that rumour be true sir henry also that army be retiring have done more than did before more indeed sir henry have burnt many village slain many welshman have done nothing towards subduing glendower chapter battle of homildon hill how

taken before glendower who treated well put to ransom with engagement be not again to bear arm in wale be strange leniency on part hotspur exclaimed for hear put to sword who fall into hand without regard for rule of civilized war be strange man sir henry subject fancy to changeable mood when be brought before be in happy one over success have gained may be that took liking for at rate fixed ransom at very small sum will of course pay hotspur said since be squire be at ludlow on service thank much sir henry 't be so small sum discharged without difficulty 't be strange most strange that must have gone into lion den have come out unscathed strange indeed that glendower who a know be greatly in want of money must have fixed ransom at low sum how much be sir oswald will tell story sir henry though must tell one else for freedom be due to something happened nigh two year ago when be first with sir edmund mortimer failed in what be strict duty although disobeyed order have received conscience altogether acquits of wrong may be sure sir oswald that matter will go further knowing a do feel sure that matter be be not to discredit so trust lord might have cost head have king come to know will first tell that ransom be fixed at crown that of roger at penny hotspur who have be looking little grave laughed surely never before be so much bone sinew appraised at so small sum be so put simply that might with truth avow be put to ransom however paid crown penny have so discharged obligation be how matter came about related whole circumstance to sir henry manner in little chain given to by glendower daughter have be mean of saving life blame in way sir oswald hotspur said cordially when have heard story though say not that king must have viewed matter in same light still held to letter of order be placed there to give warning of approach of hostile body naught be said to a to letting man still le woman depart from place indeed how must blame since heaven have assoiled for

henry second with intention of curbing to extent power of great vassal although taken by knight on being presented with feu be deemed of effect in case of immediate lord being at war with king whenever trouble arose lord vassal always sided with being universally understood that oath to from whom have received land be paramount over to king there having be several formality to be observed matter to be discussed oswald be unable to ride home until after ceremony have taken place upon following morning roger started early arrived that evening at yardhope welcome be warm one satisfaction of father delight of mother at seeing in knightly armour be great indeed increased when told that have received knighthood at hand of king that hotspur have granted feus of stoubes rochester then will

muster fifty sixty in for defence will live chiefly at alnwick father rochester be given to a hereditary feu will hold stoubes for extra service at castle have little doubt that percy will if do good service make also hereditary a much a said so will make good portion lad yardhope be knight feu though have never taken up knighthood percy know must fight just a stoutly a john forster a if wore knightly armour though land be wide be poor while yours be fertile lying down by river moreover coquetdale be more liable to scotch incursion than reddesdale a road into scotland run along if need be can lend hand to other though together must not hold either place mine against strong invasion now tell how be that won spur how be that king knighted after have eaten drank will do so father for indeed roger be well nigh famishing after meal related whole story of adventure well lad be in luck father said when have finished help gave maiden might have brought head to block turned out well be saving of life so will say nought against deed especially a owed allegiance either to mortimer to talbot be save for order hotspur have given own master two day later having sent over on morning after arrival message to tenant to present at stoubes to take oath to oswald accompanied by father rode into reddesdale found castle much stronger place than yardhope be fortified house while be moated building with strong wall flanking tower keep must be held successfully even if wall be captured by sudden assault at twelve o'clock tenant assembled oswald read to two parchment then took oath to be well satisfied to have young knight a lord for feus have be held by minor who have died two year before have not be at castle since be taken away a child to be brought up at town of alnwick where have remained under eye of percy have long be understood however that feu must not be granted to for be weakly from birth wholly unfitted for charge of castle so near scottish border according to feudal usage tenant expected that must be called upon to pay heavy sum under name of relief a be customary in case of new lord taking possession be greatly relieved when oswald told that a already possessed armour horse must quit for fourth part of usual amount although must of course require service to enable to repair such dilapidation a castle have suffered during long term that have stood empty for next three month stayed in stoubes roger have be sent off at once with two men at arm to bring horse armour have be left at welshpool bearing letter to governor from oswald thanking much for having taken care of saying briefly that have be left on field for dead after fight near llanidloes have recovered be well treated by glendower who have put to ransom took money with to pay expense for keep

that must have made for at alnwick a must be difficult to obtain suit sufficiently large for at end of three month necessary repair to castle be finished gate have be greatly strengthened with thick band of iron moat cleared out at various point defence have be strengthened small amount of furniture then deemed necessary still remained there where needful have be repaired put in good order eight men at arm have be taken by oswald into service trusty man appointed a seneschal then after paying visit to yardhope oswald rode with roger two well mounted men at arm to alnwick be now april bad news have just arrived glendower have commenced campaign with great vigour a appearance of comet have be interpreted by bard a omen most favourable to force have greatly increased during winter have destroyed house strong place of welshman who have not taken up arm at order have closely blockaded carnarvon marched to bangor levelled cathedral that of saint asaph by fire burnt episcopal palace canon house so formidable did become that king issued writ to lieutenant of fewer than thirty four county to assemble force at lichfield to crush glendower latter have now taken offensive advanced towards hereford carried fire sword through mortimer land sir edmund gathered own nephew tenant retainer from herefordshire radnorshire advanced against glendower army met on nd of june at short distance from knighton battle be obstinately fought be decided by desertion of welsh tenant by welsh bowman in mortimer service turning bow against men at arm finally english be defeated with loss of eleven hundred men sir edmund being made prisoner after battle welsh behaved with greatest savagery killing wounded stripping fallen horribly mutilating body news created great excitement at alnwick have not situation in north be critical percy must have gathered force marched with speed to avenge defeat capture of brother in law earl of dunbar with many of tenant of former estate number of english borderer have entered scotland carried out considerable raid in revenge for douglas despatched thomas halliburton patrick hepburn with considerable force to invade northumberland halliburton ravaged country a far a bamborough collected great spoil returned with hepburn who have still larger force penetrated farther into england carried ravage to within few mile of alnwick then retired north with enormous amount of booty when however have crossed border into country known a merse north of berwick earl of dunbar fell upon at west nesbit completely defeated hepburn with large number of men fell in battle many important prisoner be captured battle be fought on same day glendower defeated victory caused great exultation on border alwyn said to nephew although be good a far a go oswald may be sure that douglas will not brook disaster with patience will gather scottish force may expect ere long at head of twenty thousand men will have fight a stiff a of otterburn will have northumberland ablaze will see that earl hotspur will soon be preparing to meet storm last foray took by surprise a lord of march have suffered serious humiliation for victory be not theirs work of dunbar have not intercepted scot on own side of border must have returned scatheless with spoil of northern district disgrace will spur on to make great effort will be needed will see northumberland cumberland durham in flame alwyn be not mistaken messenger be sent off to holding knight feus throughout county bidding to prepare to answer to percy call to hold tenant in readiness to march to point fixed upon for general rendezvous be to warn countryside directly news arrived that scot be in motion be to drive cattle horse to nearest fortified town to take to hiding place among hill everything of value be to be taken away hidden so that enemy must find empty house oswald rode to yardhope with message to father know father said that needed not to warn a be short distance out of way to come round here thought must pay day visit lad directly heard of victory of dunbar said to myself will bring scot upon in force douglas will never put up with defeat will make effort to turn table will send there be worth taking away to shepherd hut among fell will a soon a hear that douglas preparation be well nigh complete journey with mother to alnwick leave there will return with men will drive cattle horse to place where there be little chance of scot finding will then after leaving three four men to look after come back to alnwick what do propose to do will do much same father stoubes be strong enough to hold out against ordinary raid not against army led by douglas will remove furnishing tapestry will send most valuable into alnwick have rest of hidden in wood be order have be sent along border whose place be so strong that may well defend for time be to gather neighbour there rest be to repair to alnwick to join percy force see there be knowing where storm may break scot may cross cheviot anywhere between berwick carlisle until movement be known earl hotspur must keep force at alnwick in readiness to march wheresoever required hotspur have sent messenger down to midland to engage a many archer a can get of course have many here borderer be spearmen rather than archer be well to strengthen force still however large force may raise can not hope to check first incursion whole country be open to if enter near carlisle may be in heart of cumberland durham before be fairly in motion may count however on meeting a retire if not before oswald then rode to own place bade tenant prepare to ride with to alnwick at hour notice to send woman child on there a soon a be known that scotch army be gathering strongly on border else to gather store of provision up in hill to send woman child there moment word came that scot be on move news of mortimer defeat capture have be received by time oswald returned to alnwick 't be bad news indeed percy said to know that a have be staying so long at ludlow will be deeply grieved at misfortune have befallen mortimer however doubt not that will soon be ransomed know that king appointed commission of knight to treat at once with glendower for lord grey ransom have given order for raising of great sum demanded be to be gathered from tax on church property in other way doubtless will do same for mortimer whose land have be so harried by welsh that will be impossible to raise large sum from tenant fear sir henry oswald said that king will be lukewarm on subject during three invasion have never once summoned sir edmund to join have passed through ludlow a might well have done seeing that be central position nearest way for army marching towards plinlimmon remarked too that when mentioned mortimer name in discourse with king brow clouded a if ill pleased at name then act wrongly hotspur said angrily mortimer have given cause for offence have never in way upheld cause of young earl of march know well enough that must be madness to set up claim to throne when henry have given cause for complaint that boy existence seems to be well nigh forgotten by country however a soon a business be over will myself to london will beg king to exercise same benevolence in case of mortimer a have shown on behalf of lord grey why might a well suspect to whom largely owes kingdom a mortimer seeing that wife be aunt to young earl early in august became known that preparation be being made upon great scale by douglas for invasion of england that a military governor of scotland have summoned great noble to join with force be even said that number of french knight be on account of long friendship between france scotland crossing sea to fight under douglas against old enemy methinks hotspur said to knight there can be little doubt that there be agreement between scotland glendower must account for fury welshman have be showing manner in have destroyed cathedral church castle alike so forced henry to march against with force of greater part of england just when douglas be preparing to assail here force of westmoreland cumberland durham northumberland if together might hope to make stout resistance even against so large force a douglas be collecting can not so gather earl of westmoreland who command force of own county cumberland must need hold together lest scot pour down besiege carlisle carry fire sword through county from here up to berwick country have be so plundered devastated that be almost desert can draw strength from there a to durham urge with truth that a scot have before now laid portion of county waste can not send force so far north a place a must leave unprotected must enemy march through tynedale into county king have entered wale with fighting men of thirty four county so from aid can be expected seems to that will be quite unable to make head against invasion though assuredly when have gathered force be joined by dunbar will bring will meet a return spoil laden to border well mounted messenger have be placed on road by scot must cross border on th of august one came with news that twelve hour before have crossed into cumberland at kirksop foot that be reported to be ten thousand strong that dozen village be already in flame portion of army have crossed near tynehead be pouring into tynedale john forster wife have arrived day before oswald have found comfortable lodging for mother in town be already crowded with woman child from border father have left again at once returned with twenty spear twelve hour after messenger have brought news have two three of men out said to oswald a rode in dismounted in castle yard a soon a heard that scot have entered tynedale knew that be time to be off for be sure to send over strong party to ravage coquetdale road be well nigh blocked in place with fugitive in spite of warning have be issued most of people seem to have thought that scot must never come in direction news have caused panic however near border scot will find little plunder have have so many invasion that man be foolish enough to spend money on aught that can not easily carry away raider will there find empty house may sweep in of cattle from hill to supply with food on march more than will not take a go south a must be encumbrance in few day strong force be collected at alnwick though chafing at news of terrible devastation be being made by scot in cumberland durham earl hotspur must at present hing invasion be indeed one of most disastrous have ever taken place after having almost devastated two county douglas with united force enormous train of waggon laden with plunder great quantity of cattle other spoil turned north again at end of second week of september in meanwhile percy force have be steadily growing have early resolved that upon return of scot battle must be fought contented with sending small body of well mounted knight horseman to hover in neighbourhood of scotch army to keep informed of intention route seemed disposed to take douglas have carried devastation up to wall of newcastle have not attempted to attack that strongly defended town have indeed gathered a much spoil a must possibly be taken along moved north in quiet leisurely way being greatly hampered by enormous train of loaded waggon a soon a earl of northumberland son saw that intended to march up through northumberland instead of returning by line that have come through tynedale set force in motion marched out leaving sufficient strength to hold alnwick must douglas attack being joined two day later by earl of dunbar posted in position whence must march to intercept scot upon road might follow on way north on th learned for certain that scot be following road must take through wooler moving instantly earl with force came up to posted on hill mile to northwest of homildon at once seized hill facing disposed knight men at arm spearmen along crest hotspur must straightway have charged down attacked scot in position dunbar put hand on bridle urged strongly to await assault to provoke scot into taking offensive by galling with archer in be far superior to while on other hand be much stronger in spear horseman hotspur seeing goodness of advice assented to ordered archer to descend at once into valley between two hill to launch arrow against scot on descending be found that scottish bowman be already in valley speedily drove up hill then sent arrow thick fast among scottish men at arm douglas have like earl of dunbar perceived at what disadvantage party who took offensive must have to fight have determined to stand on defensive especially a if moved forward english must detach body of horseman to work round hill fall upon immense train of waggon for time refused to accede to earnest entreaty of knight to advance a man after man fell under english arrow impatience increased until one of best knight sir john swinton rode few pace out of rank in loud voice said brave comrade what fascinates today that stand like deer fawn in park to be shot instead of showing ancient valour meeting foe hand to hand let who will descend with in name of god will break host conquer if not will at least die with honour like soldier mighty shout followed word whole scottish host dashed down hill english archer fell back little still shooting a did so halted short way up hill shot so hotly strongly that pierced helmet armour with arrow nothing must withstand missile shot by finest strongest bowman in world scot rolled over in heap douglas although clad in most perfect steel armour be wounded in five place one arrow destroying sight of one of eye fell from horse utter confusion reigned in scottish rank swinging bow behind archer drew ax rushed into crowd effecting terrible slaughter douglas be made prisoner a be earl of fife son of regent albany earl of moray angus orkney two baron eighty knight among whom be several frenchman several other person of rank be also captured while swinton gordon many other knight gentleman be slain together with seven hundred of commonalty with exception only of flodden battle on border be so fatal to scottish nobility whose defeat be effected by archer only confusion be so terrible that earl of northumberland refused to allow knight men at arm to charge seeing that must trample down friend foe therefore stood a passive spectator of desperate fight not lance being couched blow struck by of when be over took up pursuit of fugitive many of be overtaken killed pursuit be continued to tweed where not knowing ford many of fugitive be drowned while endeavouring to swim river roger what say to oswald asked a squire drew rein after pursuing enemy for distance roger face expressed strongest disgust well sir oswald call battle at who ever heard of battle where knight man at arm drew sword 't be out of reason to fight in manner nevertheless roger a have won great victory what matter be whether archer bore chief hand in last battle fought in be different matter have plenty of fighting victory be more to taste nevertheless roger grumbled even though welsh well nigh made end of for must not help hoping that archer must be beaten leave to to take part in fighting have done more than share when have broken scottish rank slain know not how many must have be fair of after to draw back leave to to finish business 't be well a be roger for one be well satisfied have given scot lesson will keep quiet for long time have recovered spoil be carrying off must have won nothing more have be in thick of melee come out of perhaps sorely wounded again roger however be by mean satisfied to end of life always fell into bad temper when battle of homildon be spoken of prisoner of consequence be taken to alnwick where army fell back much to disgust of of more eager spirit who must fain have crossed frontier made reprisal for woe scot have inflicted northumberland however be well satisfied with what have be won did not wish to provoke scot to extremity feeling that with so many of leader in hand might be able to arrange term must ensure peace for considerable time on border prisoner be treated with great kindness consideration be lodged in castle be treated a guest rather than a prisoner oswald father be pleased to hear two day after battle when scottish dead be examined body of william baird ten of kinsman be found lying together have resisted desperately to last refusing to surrender well knowing that misdeed many depredation in england must bring to gallows if taken alive well father will be able to live in peace for time now doubt bairds have brought with spear must muster for none must willingly have stayed at home when there be promise of gathering so much booty therefore strength must be altogether broken will be long indeed before bairds ride in raid into northumberland father nodded 't be good thing oswald assuredly though must rather that have have attacking of in own hold still at rate there be end of feud for year to come will be able to lie down to sleep without wondering whether will be knocking at gate before morning chapter percy discontent during time have elapsed between receiving news of mortimer capture by glendower battle of homildon hill percy have written several time to king with reference to taking same step to ransom mortimer that have taken on behalf of lord grey king however answered very coldly one of letter more than hinted that believed that mortimer have voluntarily placed in glendower hand that agreement existed between not only be hotspur furious at accusation earl be deeply angered 't be past belief hotspur said that charge must be made have mortimer wished to join glendower must have gone to not a prisoner at head of three thousand good fighting men why must have thrown away life of twelve hundred of own vassal of nephew nay more have mortimer intended treachery might have marched fallen on rear of king army entangled among welsh mountain forest while glendower fell upon from in front 't be lie bear mark on face 't be excuse for refusing to ransom mortimer who hope will be kept prisoner for year whose estate will thus be able to appropriate 't be insult not only to mortimer to to whom owes crown let beware who built up can pull down knight standing round put hand on sword hilt significantly king be to follower of great baron person of small consequence in comparison with lord must draw sword at latter order a willingly against king a against foreign foe that be duty to do so be so fully recognized that in trouble between king noble while latter be if defeated executed for treason vassal be permitted to return home unmolested be not until battle of barnet edward enraged at humiliation that have suffered when have be obliged to fly to france gave order that quarter be to be shown to warwick vassal retainer northumberland hotspur be still smarting under treatment of mortimer when eight day after battle messenger have despatched to king in wale with report of great victory capture of douglas other important noble returned with order from king that prisoner be not to be ransomed order be received with passionate indignation by earl hotspur although not altogether contrary to usage of age since similar order have more than once be issued by edward third ransom of prisoner taken in battle be regarded a one of most important source of revenue a mean of defraying expense noble knight be put to in aiding with vassal king in war occasionally however in case of prisoner of importance monarch deemed necessary for political reason to forbid ransom of prisoner scottish noble be a indignant a percy have regarded a matter of course that must be shortly liberated ransom however heavy must be soon forthcoming for be one of condition on land be held that in case of lord being taken prisoner of tenant must contribute largely in proportion to holding towards payment of ransom order of king clearly meant that be to be taken to london held there a hostage perhaps for year so not only to ensure england against invasion to further design of conquest that king might entertain with three of great earl of scotland one of son of regent douglas military leader of scot in hand with earl of dunbar a ally scotland must be practically at mercy important meeting be held at alnwick at scottish noble earl of northumberland hotspur be alone present here matter of vital interest to kingdom be arranged for six month thing remained in same state king fourth expedition into wale have effected no more than preceding glendower be still virtually master of wale cardiff have be burned by with numerous priory convent with exception of of franciscan castle of penmarc town castle of abergavenny have be burned other strong place captured percy remained during time sullen inactive although somewhat mollified by thanks voted by parliament king a reward for service bestowed upon estate of douglas however treated with scorn for a well might have presented to city of naples paris since unless scotland be conquered must not come into peaceful mastership of douglas estate indeed must king have intended in earnest for be far too politic to think of adding so great increase of territory to estate of percy who have already shown power by placing on throne who might day take back what have given by declaring in favour of earl of march one day in february oswald be summoned from stoubes to alnwick on arrival there be requested to go to earl chamber summons be extremely unusual hotspur have own estate own retinue following be jointly with father warden of march though dwelt generally with at alnwick have own portion of castle thus be seldom that earl have communication with hotspur knight hastening to obey oswald found hotspur with father have mission for sir oswald hotspur said on part of earl know that for long time there have be disputation between father earl of westmoreland respecting scottish prisoner earl sent small force to fight under at homildon be mere handful on strength of advanced claim to considerable share of ransom of prisoner since must not be ransomed to custody of person of earl of moray angus king have now contrary to reason inflicted upon indignity of appointing four commissioner two of whom be knight other two men of consequence to inquire into question between father uncle earl of westmoreland doe think that two of earl be going to submit to so gross indignity who be a much master in north of england a be in south even that owes to have ridden over seen westmoreland who be a indignant a be at once arranged little matter in be at variance agreed upon common measure be not seeing that king absolutely refused to do to mortimer same service that did to lord grey whose ransom have now paid who by way have married glendower daughter jane mortimer vassal with aid from ourselves have raised money required to free mortimer now king have interfered have given order that such ransom will not be paid be evident that determines to drive to extremity tell thing in order that may see how intolerable condition of affair have become father believe that be judgment of heaven upon for having helped to dethrone king richard lawful sovereign of country to place usurper on throne even have richard conduct rendered deposition necessary did wrong in passing over lawful heir young earl of march 't be true be child at time be older now feel shame that must be kept a prisoner by henry have not king perjured must not have be led into error for before assisted swore great oath that have intention of gaining throne only to regain own dukedom of lancaster be on ground that lent aid now forsooth perjured usurper treat who made a dirt under foot be resolved to suffer no longer since may not ransom mortimer will secure freedom in other way for may give aid assuredly sir henry lord earl oswald who be deeply indignant at unworthy treatment of lord replied hotly life be at service expected nothing else hotspur said matter stand thus owen glendower be warm partisan of king richard be one of few who remained faithful to end thereby incurring deep hostility of henry of adherent lord grey be for land be unjustly seized for henry parliament refused to accede to complaint so drove to take up arm thus then in enterprise against henry glendower be natural ally intend to propose to that alliance undertaking that if will give aid claim to crown of wale will be acknowledged that will govern country without interference from england there be none who must carry out negotiation so well a since can by virtue of ring gave pas unarmed to while other knight must be assuredly slain will bear letter signed by earl offering friendship alliance on term explain to more fully manner in have be driven to throw off henry authority can tell that will proclaim earl of march lawful king if agrees to join in project must be clearly to liking advantage must be a well that must a soon a move may not be for time yet release sir edmund mortimer who a boy uncle will assuredly raise vassal on behalf now that henry have shown such animosity against will gladly undertake mission lord more gladly since may lead to liberation of sir edmund mortimer who treated with greatest kindness condescension during stay at ludlow prepare to start tomorrow then earl said letter will be ready for tonight beyond what son have told can tell glendower that have good hope of large help from scotland with whom be said be already in alliance next morning oswald started taking one roger with have evening before told squire only that be starting on journey promising to tell more a rode accordingly when well away from alnwick beckoned to roger to bring up horse alongside of where think that be going roger will give fifty guess must warrant that must not come at truth matter nothing to master so that ride with be content know roger how grievously king have treated percy how have prevented taking ransom for prisoner have refused to ransom sir edmund mortimer how in bitter jest offered earl estate of douglas how have put upon indignity of sending four men of import to decide upon difference with westmoreland ay ay sir oswald everyone know not few have wondered that percy have suffered thing in quietness fresh thing have happened roger tenant of mortimer with aid from earl hotspur have raised sum glendower demanded a ransom now king have laid on order that money be not to be paid by lady roger exclaimed wrathfully be too much sir edmund be noble gentleman that king must refuse to allow friend to ransom pass bound so earl hotspur consider oswald said ere long will see that will hoist banner of young earl of march proclaim king of england 't be good roger exclaimed slapping hand on leg to matter nought who be king of england always held that be hard that king richard must be deposed murdered by one who be not even lawful successor be not one to question conduct of lord always thought that percy be wrong in bringing usurper over feel that roger consider ingratitude of king to be punishment upon for having aided to throne what have to do with journey master have much to do with roger seeing that be on way to glendower to offer alliance with percy good step roger exclaimed know that welsh can fight moreover roger may bring about freeing of mortimer for evil feeling king have shown against will surely drive to raise vassal of young earl in herefordshire elsewhere thus percy will gain two powerful ally glendower mortimer a advance from north welsh mortimer will join from west when victory be gained there will be peace on welsh march owen will be recognized for what be king of wale doubtless will then suffer english to live quietly there just a welsh have lived quietly in england then too western county will see that be interest to side with mortimer glendower four time during last three year have be called out forced to leave home to follow king into wale a often have have to return leaving behind many of number will see that if glendower be acknowledged king of wale hard grievous service will no longer be required of be so sir oswald in truth like project well matter not straw to who be king if king treat lord scurvily be ready to shout 'down with ' to do best to put up in place though indeed 't be salve to conscience to know that man be fighting against be usurper one who have set up in place of lawful king conscience in way prick roger fight at lord order against foe be duty have sworn to a between king 't be matter for alone at same time be glad that business be likely to end in rescue of knight who have be very kind to between henry young earl of march have opinion seems to that since henry ascended to throne by might by popular voice have cause to complain if be put out of by same mean must war go against percy master again be matter for earl hotspur know what force earl of westmoreland can put in field know glendower can aid with ten thousand welshman that mortimer can raise three four thousand men from vassal must know what help can count on from scotland doubtless during last six month have made acquainted with general feeling respecting king be upon that risk chiefly fall knight men at arm may fall in field of battle be risk that know have to face when take to calling of arm if cause be lost escape from battlefield have to depart to hold village will hear nought more of affair while lord if taken must lose head will be grief for to lose master love to have to pay quittance with money service to new lord beyond risk nought save life in battle therefore trouble in way a to matter between percy king take in way concern be content to do duty to render service a have sworn to do be well sir oswald roger said after long pause glendower gave ring for from account welshman be more furious than ever there must be small chance of ever reaching without chain did work last time 't be not welshman who must stop to examine before striking few who must read inscription if did so while 't be like most of be well acquainted with glendower signet be so nevertheless roger will be better when have once crossed border that must ride behind with white flag displayed a token that come not for war on peaceful mission be probable at rate that band of welshman who may meet will in case before attacking stop to inquire on what errand come rode fast for earl have said that needed to have news of glendower decision before proceeding further in matter in four day arrived on border at shrewsbury oswald inquired carelessly of host of inn where put up where glendower be now thought to be a intended to journey south to hereford must fain know whether there be risk of falling in with band of marauder methinks sir knight that may travel without uneasiness seeing that country between hereford have be so harassed by that there be nought to tempt to cross border save with so large force that can invade gloucester worcestershire men say moreover glendower be at present in cardiganshire there be still few welsh inhabitant here declare that be loyal to king love not wild countryman whether be so not can not say certainly manage to keep up communication with welsh may be for treacherous purpose may be a say that knowing that belonging to must be slain must glendower capture town for own safety try to learn intention movement in order to warn must surprise be intended starting early next morning oswald crossed into montgomeryshire by road through worktree forest so a to avoid ludlow welshpool kept along by country track near border of radnor so passing south of llanidloes a soon a have left radnorshire roger fastened to spear white cloth have brought from shrewsbury then continued journey west be not until have crossed wye here insignificant stream that came upon native of country be following track between two rough hill covered with brushwood when man evidently of better class stepped out before sir knight said in english 't be strange sight to see englishman with one esquire travelling alone by so wild lonely road a strange indeed that must bear flag of truce for be here on king business must surely be attended with braver show have notice two hour ago brought by one who have seen cross wye in bush round lie fifty men who did raise hand must let fly arrow against if have reason for coming way assuredly must not hinder oswald held out hand signet ring sir be given by glendower who said that welshman to whom might show must act a guide escort to come on important mission not from king from one from whom glendower may be glad to hear therefore pray take to at least send party of men for might peradventure fall in with who must shoot before questioned 't be assuredly prince signet man said after carefully examining right gladly will escort to be at present at aberystwith thanks for courtesy sir to whom be speaking name be howel ap ryddyn passed abode can not be seen from road must be not pressed for time gladly entertain if push forward may reach aberystwith before make question must better suit wish thanks sir business be somewhat urgent will be glad to meet prince a soon a possible indeed must not be sorry to reach spot where can sup sleep seeing that have twice slept in wood since left shrewsbury man called out order in welsh four men at once issued from bush under guidance horseman soon reached aberystwith have scarce expected pleasure sir oswald glendower said warmly a young knight entered to what good fortune do owe visit 't be poor hospitality questioning thus when will be time enough to talk of such thing later be matter be best discussed in private oswald replied in undertone how have fared since parted since saw over year ago time have passed quietly save for battle with scot where although beat there be credit gained by knight men at arm seeing that archer alone did fighting so heard on side have be busy ever since successful too a have heard yes fortune have be in favour lord grey ransom have be of much use to having married daughter jane can no longer be considered foe yet to do justice must not promise even to stand neutral though unless under special order from king will not draw sword again love stanch man though grey have taken a consider wrong side stand to faithfully offered freedom without ransom if must promise neutrality that when have put down other opposition must hold welsh land from refused said that must rather remain in chain life than be false to vow to henry be good must that welshman be a faithful take oath to one week make peace with next nay to please must go so far a to try to assassinate two such plot have there be year be only that wore good mail shirt under garment that life be saved from bow shot from one who professed to be warm friend who have taken bread with hour before be destiny sir oswald power watch over keep from harm will know protect to end against stroke of english foe of welsh traitor after supper be over glendower led oswald to private chamber now sir oswald can speak freely have placed guard outside door there be fear of interruption do come on own account from come from earl of northumberland son sir henry percy be charged in first place to deliver letter to then to give such further intelligence a to matter a may be needful for to know from percy glendower said in surprise a cut silk held roll together countenance expressed great surprise a read content there be snare in said suddenly after reading through two three time looking sharply at oswald 't be not from percy who more than other assisted usurper to throne must have looked for such offer must be last to bring letter to glendower be there aught behind what be written earl hotspur spoke of matter at length to regret now part took in enthroning henry at whose hand have now received such indignity that be resolved if may be to undo work to place lawful king young earl of march on throne then related various complaint that percy have against king told glendower that matter have be brought to head by henry refusal to allow to pay ransom have be collected for sir edmund mortimer whom have with glendower asked after listening in silence have earl of westmoreland who like be greatly offended at appointment of four commissioner men of standing position to judge between two of great baron of england blood relation too whose difference be on matter of small importance other name be mentioned before earl stated that looked for much assistance from scotland ay ay a hold in hand douglas regent son moray angus may well make term with scotland yes be very great plot since can get ransom for mortimer can raise three four thousand men must be of more value to free than a prisoner be not only that oswald said fact that a young march uncle must head following raise banner will show that percy be not using young march name a mere pretext for taking up arm if head of house during minority guardian of estate be with men must see that 't be really struggle to place lawful king on throne many must join who did think be affair between percy of whom know little in south whom have be taught to consider rebel must stand aloof 't be well thought of project plea even without such ally may hold mountain continue warfare there must be peace prosperity for year with overthrow of usurper acknowledgment a king of wale of entire independence of country from dee to severn freedom of country might be permanently secured will give certain answer tonight 't be matter to be turned over in mind a seems to that may gain much good by alliance that even if percy fail in enterprise can be worse off than be at present be not until following evening glendower gave decided answer accept percy offer said have thought over in way even putting aside benefit to country must enter upon be for satisfaction of seeing usurper murderer of dear master king richard have same measure meted out to that gave to sovereign tonight will write answer to percy for to bear to tomorrow morning will ride with to stronghold where mortimer be at present held in durance if consent to join will give freedom without ransom started next morning early at noon arrived at strong house lying in heart of hill be best that must see first sir oswald explain matter to after will meet with great be astonishment of sir edmund when oswald be ushered into little room in be confined be ten foot square furnished with pallet chair small table window be very strongly barred observed with pain that ten month imprisonment have told very heavily upon mortimer why oswald ah see must say sir oswald what brings here good news trust have ransom be collected have be collected sir edmund oswald said a shook hand king who refused altogether to pay ransom a did lord grey have forbidden money raised partly by tenant partly by tenant of nephew to be handed over 't be clear that view a enemy have indeed ventured to declare belief that capture by glendower be thing arranged beforehand lie sir edmund exclaimed angrily fought stoutly have not be for treachery of welsh bowman must have won day then how stand matter sir oswald how be that be here oswald then related purport of mission gave message with hotspur have charged on evening before started assuredly will join sir edmund exclaimed when oswald brought story to conclusion have not suffered enough by keeping force on foot by having land harried vassal slain in order to support henry claim to kingdom of wale only to be suspected of treachery have intended to join glendower must have done so year before with force must have kept henry at bay why must have kept up pretext of loyalty when there be nought to have prevented joining glendower why must have fought at cost of life of twelve hundred of men when must have marched into camp a friend why must suffer nine month of close imprisonment at hand of ally henry lied knew that lied when brought charge against wished to be able to work will on young earl maybe to murder a murdered richard without there being one powerful enough to lift voice to condemn murder be at end between henceforth be open enemy a be mine must be heart soul with percy in overthrow of henry even if nephew be not concerned did earl purpose to grasp crown glendower be below sir edmund will speak to thought that be best must first open matter to quarter of hour later keeper of hold came up said that prince bade sir edmund to descend speak with a entered room where glendower be waiting latter glanced at oswald inquiringly matter be settled latter said sir edmund will join with heart hand be indeed glad to hear sir oswald sir edmund mortimer went on courteously hitherto have regarded other a enemy henceforth be friend be guest not prisoner have thought over methinks that must tarry here till have certain news of day on percy will set on foot enterprise must not be safe for to return to estate until be in position to call vassal to arm at once for king be to hear that be at ludlow might call on lieutenant of western county owner of castle to attack at once therefore until be time to strike be best that must remain with propose that must accompany on expedition for to do so might do harm across border will therefore assign suitable house at aberystwith with such attendance furnishing a be due to guest of quality prospect seems to be fair one northern lord aided by scot must by be match for gathering henry must collect at short notice joined by force yours must surely be able to overthrow opposition so appears to sir edmund said 't be indeed powerful confederation if go well ought to leave option to usurper to die in battle to fly to france will return with to aberystwith sir oswald glendower presently asked young knight will ride straight for england with permission oswald said be already thirty mile on way percy urged to return a soon a possible so be a soon a have dined officer four horseman will be in readiness to ride with a escort week later oswald reached alnwick be bearer of letter from glendower mortimer be able to report complete success of mission a mark of satisfaction earl ordered deed of gift to be made to of large strip of land extending over hill between stoubes yardhope day said a handed document to will be master of yardhope by thus joining that feu to of stoubes will have estate will make power in upper glade of reddesdale coquetdale will support dignity of knight banneret now bestow upon also appoint deputy warden of march with power of life death over marauder reivers outlaw have long felt that must be well that there must be one who in case of necessity must raise hundred spear so prevent body of marauder from other side of border making sudden irruption into dale from what have heard of from sir henry be sure that will carry out charge most worthily new acquisition must not very largely increase oswald revenue for greater portion of grant be hill moor nevertheless there be good many house small village scattered in dale be raised tract of land to value of knight feu in point of position however be large addition a knight banneret with castle of stoubes at one end of holding hold of yardhope at other must occupy important position on border must raise at least hundred spear among tenant in addition to men at arm of two stronghold three day later hotspur released whole of scottish prisoner sent under escort to border percy now began in earnest preparation for war for greater convenience hotspur went down to morpeth while earl betook to berwick on tweed where must confer more easily with scottish ally who on part be carrying out condition on have be released without ransom namely that must join force to of percy oswald made journey to wale time by ship from carlisle to aberystwith there acquainted glendower mortimer with preparation have be made assuring that rising must take place at end of may also asked glendower to raise a large army a possible without delay sir edmund mortimer to betake at once to hereford there to raise banner summon vassal of earl of march to join king having on return from last expedition entered ludlow seized mortimer plate other property appointed to governorship of ludlow knight on whose devotion must rely chapter shrewsbury percy preparation must not be carried on without exciting attention in march king seeing that open defiance of authority by release of scottish prisoner must assuredly be followed by armed rebellion douglas must probably have pledged to aid a condition of release began on side to make similar preparation levy be called out prince of wale be appointed to command of welsh march governorship of wale towards end of june douglas faithful to agreement crossed frontier be at once joined by hotspur with force have gathered hotspur father be lying sick at berwick be to follow a speedily a possible with army collected in north of county from dunbar estate have be arranged that glendower must meet ally at lichfield on being joined by uncle earl of westmoreland with following hotspur marched south intention be after effecting junction with glendower to march give battle to army with henry prince of wale be advancing against at lichfield however learned that glendower have not completed preparation in sufficient time to join therefore changed direction made for shrewsbury towards place glendower be marching percy array have swollen a went south have be joined by number of archer from cheshire by other adherent of late king regarding war a attempt not to place earl of march upon throne to overthrow usurper who have dethroned king oswald rode with sixty spearmen from own estate while father with thirty men from yardhope rode in company regarded failure of glendower to come to place appointed a serious misfortune of course oswald said if join at shrewsbury before king come up will not matter much indeed must be in one respect better mortimer with force will be coming on though be scarce likely to arrive at shrewsbury in time for battle for must not leave wale to summon levy to field until prince of wale have drawn off force marched to join father reinforcement afterwards will fill up gap in rank be great assistance must henry be able to rally army in midland can not hope to do so before reach london that sound fairly oswald 't be always better to carry out plan have made absence of glendower at point arranged to mind augur ill henry be able general believing that percy must make for welsh border have posted at burton on trent a soon a heard that have changed course started for shrewsbury marched so quickly that arrived there before hotspur thus throwing between percy welsh hotspur on arriving near town be enraged at hearing glendower have not arrived according to promise king army be encamped on eastern side of town northern force took post short distance away that night hotspur sent document into royal camp declaring henry to be forsworn perjured in first place because have sworn under holy gospel that must claim nothing own proper inheritance that richard must reign to end of life secondly because have raised tax other imposition contrary to oath by own arbitrary power thirdly because have caused king richard to be kept in castle of pontefract without meat drink fire whereof perished of hunger thirst cold there be other clause of regarding conduct to sir edmund mortimer claim of young earl of march to throne be also set forward document ended with defiance henry simply sent a reply that have time to lose in writing that must in morning prove in battle whose claim be false feigned nevertheless in morning when two army be arrayed in order of battle king sent abbot of shrewsbury to propose amicable arrangement hotspur douglas however rejected offer trumpet then blew on side army joined battle number be about equal consisted of fourteen thousand men douglas hotspur have taken place in centre of line having behind party of best knight charged with fury down upon king standard stood in centre of array hotspur douglas former rival be accounted two of best knight in christendom fury of charge be irresistible centre of royal line be cleft in sunder king guard be at once dispersed have not henry taken precaution of arraying in plain armour while two of knight have put on royal surcoat battle must at once have be decided a be two knight be killed a be earl of stafford sir walter blount royal standard be overthrown young prince of wale sorely wounded in face have already shown sign of great military talent in spite of wound now showed courage presence of mind justified confidence father have shown in giving important command rode hither among disorganized troop saw that gap in centre be again closed up be ever to be met where fight be impetuous charge of hotspur douglas be ruin of army have paused until troop have advanced close to enemy mounted men at arm be ranged closely behind in position to support fight must assuredly have speedily terminated in favour before arrived royal army have closed rank rebel leader with principal knight be cut off from main body in vain men of north tried to cut way through southern rank to come to assistance of chief who surrounded now by english knight men at arm be fighting desperately against overwhelming number hour after battle began many party of welshman came up joined in conflict absence of leader loss of respective captain hotspur douglas paralysed effort of northumbrians scottish contingent yet fought stoutly suffered very heavy loss for upwards of two hour hotspur maintained unequal fight at length arrow pierced hotspur visor fell dead from horse further resistance be useless survivor of group have be reduced to mere handful surrendered for half hour main battle raged then came news that hotspur be killed douglas westmoreland prisoner english horseman dashed down on flank of northern line spearmen pressed forward scotch northumbrians broke fled when knight first charged oswald have be with own following hundred other horseman on left flank a soon a saw what have happened endeavoured to ride round right flank of royal army be met by much larger force of men at arm after hard fighting driven back oswald with roger on one hand father on other have several time hewed way deep into enemy squadron must have be cut off have not yardhope moss trooper spurred furiously in to rescue brought off again several time charge be renewed ineffectually rebel army have be killed when at last infantry broke be clear that there be more to be done oswald who be wounded in dozen place called survivor of troop to follow with party rode off in good order mile from field halted for few minute not one of have be more le severely wounded in desperate melee now took off armour bandaged other wound then mounting again rode off what do say father oswald asked will circle round join glendower know that army be close at hand be to attack tonight must win easy victory for king men have suffered well nigh a sorely a have oswald have done enough have not be fighting for earl of march have be simply following feudal lord a be bound to do be dead have nought to do with quarrel what be to whether march henry be king be not pursued greater part of english cavalry be exhausted by exertion against hotspur douglas loss be extremely heavy in condition to pursue took up comparatively easy work of cutting down flying footman battle have be disastrous one for side loss be about even number who fell altogether being put at ten thousand men with douglas earl of westmoreland baron of kinderton sir richard vernon other knight be captured westmoreland kinderton vernon be at once executed on field of battle a rebel douglas a foreign knight be simply viewed a prisoner of war be kindly treated glendower took advantage of opportunity for striking blow at royal army instead of attacking when spent by fatigue encumbered with wound retired at once to wale have instead of doing marched to meet sir edmund mortimer who be hurrying forward with powerful array united force must have be fully double strength of english army great commander must at once have fought battle must probably have altered whole course of event in england glendower conduct here showed that although able partisan leader in irregular warfare have claim to be considered great general travelling rapidly oswald party crossed tyne hearing that earl now recovered from illness be marching down with army to join son rode to meet be painful duty oswald have to discharge old earl when heard of defeat of army death of son to whom be deeply attached capture of brother earl of westmoreland gave way to despair dismissed army to home at once retired completely broken down in body spirit to castle at warkworth so depressed be that when royal messenger arrived summoning in king name to surrender journey with to london instantly obeyed when questioned by king why have displayed banner of revolt against said have done so on urging of hotspur king who be always inclined to leniency when leniency be safe pardoned permitted to retain dignity estate oswald speedily recovered from wound father suffered much have fought last fight oswald said when son rode over to see few day after return from south say not that be about to die only that methinks will never be able to wield sword manfully again have talked matter over with mother agrees with that be well that handed over yardhope to mean must leave old place for generation father have lived died here must fain do same must hand over to feu must take oath for to northumberland lead retainer in field be that there be chance of raid by bairds must still maintain hold power be altogether broken at homildon moreover border scot be at peace now a have not be so long a memory run seeing that have fought side by side against king of england have suffered same misfortune in defeat therefore can hang up sword for there may be more fighting from what know of old earl be sure that will never forgive hotspur death although at present be reinstated in estate there can be doubt that king will strike further blow against power of percy northumberland be valiant soldier tenacious in purpose lasting in hatred have not be that be utterly broken by news that brought must assuredly have marched down with army tried to join glendower mortimer at least have died fighting end that must best like doubt not that will see banner raised again ere long hope not father undertaking must be desperate however may be oswald a can no longer render service for feu wish to hand over to be nominal change must like to see estate yours father have held own be content to do so adding somewhat to mean by such plunder a must carry off from scotland have greatly advanced family a deputy warden of march be a well that yardhope must be added to holding must be glad too to have known a sir oswald forster of yardhope not a sir oswald forster of stoubes in time if thing go well with charge to build castle here in place of hold have be good enough for plain men like father be fit residence for estate now hold mean to say that wish always to live here for maybe stoubes be more pleasant abode standing in fair country with climate somewhat le hard than must like to come up here at time to be known a forster of yardhope will carry out wish father must please more for thing to remain a have be plan be best lad will be seneschal here for little will be changed save that will ride at head of retainer instead of 't be not meet must hold feu when can no longer render due service mother be wholly of opinion have done enough of fighting for life must trouble no longer with raidings war mother have shown sound judgment advice have generally be good though never fully recognized till saw what great good have come of wishing to learn to read write for be to to small extent that owe rapid rise present dignity accordingly few day later oswald rode with father to warkworth to castle earl have returned after visit to england at request of john forster received back feu from appointed son to done oswald rode to pay visit to cousin while father returned to yardhope with two retainer have brought with oswald have not seen adam armstrong since latter have come to yardhope after rescue of daughter be received by with greatest warmth a also by allan who although now nearly recovered from wound have fortunately for not gained sufficient strength to be able to accompany douglas to homildon in march into england to join percy girl be out when rode up upon return showed greatest pleasure jessie being most demonstrative in welcome have always be sore subject with oswald allan said that must have ridden away in gallant enterprise to rescue sister while be lying here helpless knew indeed nought of until after have taken safely to yardhope ah roger be glad to see again to thank too for share took in in faith master allan there be great thanks due be poor affair have one opportunity that not worth naming of striking hearty blow seems to that thing be never fairly divided both in adventure at homildon scarce struck blow while in affair in wale at shrewsbury there be even more fighting than cared for have to be nursed like child after first be still stiff from wound got in second there must be reason in such matter vexed sorely that have to ride away from bairds without striking few good blow in part payment of raid here be very glad that did not have to do so janet said think there be quite enough excitement in especially a went down that rope though indeed be so strong that felt be quite safe with roger laughed must have carried two of sooth did not show confidence at time for held on so tightly to rope began to think that must never get to bottom told to hold tight janet said indignantly yes yes be natural enough difficulty be that must not let go at knot be a much a must do to get to let slide through finger very well master roger then will take care not to let lower down rope again trust there will never be need roger laughed indeed although weight be a nothing felt uneasy a went down for feared might grip too tightly seeing that be altogether unaccustomed to handling of girl well suppose roger jessie said that now war be over will be marrying settling down know how might be roger replied slowly say that matter have never entered mind seeing that be now seven thirty 't be one must not be much longer delayed mean not have ever thought a to who must be woman have thought whether when time come that sir oswald take wife must not be well must do same know not how stand abbot of alnwick have so far allowed to go out into world to unfrock to become man at arm instead of peaceful monk have not be dispensed from vow of celibacy be to marry matter might be taken up by church might be put to many sore penance punishment for breach of others laughed at seriousness with roger have answered girl jesting remark be matter have never thought of before roger oswald said assuredly must a say be fitting right that when take mistress must do so also like master like man know since thought have be turned way will see abbot next time go to alnwick lay case before of truth have made most excellent man at arm be equally certain that be exceedingly bad monk must doubtless be well that must obtain complete absolution from vow for although be sure that good abbot regard now a altogether beyond control must take step against be to hear of marriage might not be so in case of successor be old man next abbot may be of very different character looking through book of convent might say have become of brother roger see record of death ' then pushing matter further might discover backsliding might summon before there be saying what pain penalty might inflict upon roger moved uneasily in seat speak of such thing pray master imprisonment in cell flagellation nay even worse might befall at hand of rigorous abbot for in truth nought must well be more serious than offence have already committed might hold that even though present abbot have be backward in taking notice of matter in way must absolve from doing duty indeed a be be to hotspur that gave permission for to go out into world hotspur be dead there be nought own word in matter at rate can put right roger by going to abbot learning from lip that did give permission to hotspur moreover received from hotspur own lip still must be useful for to obtain from abbot letter giving full absolution for offence committed up to present time must be great thing roger said eagerly 't be matter have often turned over in mind when on long day ride have thought of what might happen be new man to become abbot of alnwick absolution must assuredly go for much one can doubt more especially abbot absolution by abbot be most effectual that offence committed before be wholly wiped out can not be revived must be best to obtain total absolution from vow can abbot grant roger 't be moot question roger replied many affirm that can do so assuredly many abbot have exercised that power others again hold that although abbot can not lawfully do so bishop can while few maintain that even be incapable that nothing short of absolution by holy father be of avail still be true state of thing must be well satisfied with abbot absolution still more so by bishop for though be great prince concerned someone interested might contest matter none must be likely to do so in case of man at arm esquire very well roger then will endeavour to obtain full absolution from vow by abbot must decline to give will when next see earl pray in consideration of good service that have rendered to obtain for from bishop have not thought of marrying oswald adam armstrong said nay uncle came of age few day since will be time to think of taking wife four five year hence so until trouble have wholly ceased be better methinks for knight to remain unwed than to take wife with risk of leaving young widow in case oswald methinks there must be little marrying in northumberland for saving short truce ill observed there be ever trouble on border speak not of oswald replied doubtless will always be subject to border raid on side even to serious war between two country speak not of of trouble in england 't be natural to fight when englishman scotchman meet arrayed in battle when englishman meet englishman 't be terrible indeed though slaughter at shrewsbury be great beyond measure who yet can say that fire be extinguished a long a one may be called to arm again by earl be in good sooth better to remain single than to have to ride to war leaving young wife behind spoken very wisely well oswald adam armstrong laughed be well to argue a to policy such argument go for nought a soon a man heart be fixed on particular woman may be so uncle a have never thought of marriage be able to look at matter dispassionately ah well time will come oswald will then speedily come to consider that there be other thing than reasonableness of waiting to be considered by way trust must england invade scotland again by valley of esk will not forget debt to bairds though lamented disaster at homildon where many of friend acquaintance fell must not feel that death of william baird so many of kin be relief indeed to have strengthened hold a see must have be ever obliged to remain on guard bairds never forgive forget manner in be tricked out of captive must have discomposed sorely rankled in mind sooner later must have tried to wipe out memory in blood wonder that have not done before homildon doubtless have other matter in hand now can live in peace too have not forgotten injury have suffered at hand must rejoice greatly did hear that stronghold have be levelled to ground hope that will be long before king march against scotland again ill success of effort must have taught do what will will never conquer scotland henry be not likely to court failure such a met with two year since 't be not like war with welsh be different people speaking in different language while lowland scot be of one blood one language scarce noble in scotland who be not of norman descent quarrel between seems to almost a bad a civil war hope that will come to think so day oswald a long a two kingdom stand apart with various interest different alliance will hardly be likely that there will be permanent peace between be so oswald agreed 't be part scotland play by alliance with france aid give by always choosing time when be fighting there to fall upon keep trouble afoot if scotland must hold aloof from france see reason why must interfere with in way good have ever come to from such alliance french army have ever gone to scotland to aid when pressed by englishman france us scotland a cat paw with to annoy weaken england may be so must remember that france doe aid scotland when keep main army of england busily occupied yes doe not fight england with intent simply fight to gain back province have lost be ready to make peace when suit wholly regardless of interest of scotland france be never to be trusted oswald said glendower made treaty with few year ago what good have done to why when needed aid most have made truce with england 't be whispered that made treaty with percy what good came of be ever ready to make treaty never observes unless be to plain interest to do so suppose be with nation a be with individual oswald selfishness have large share in management of affair france being powerful country be glad enough when pressed by english to have diversion made for whether in scotland ireland have idea of putting out for sake of ally when desire peace with england france have indeed be quick to take advantage of trouble caused to henry by rising in north while be gathering army although there be truce with england french expedition in many of royal prince took part have invaded guienne captured several castle held by english adherent made frequent descent on coast plundered ship met with captured whole fleet of merchantman taken island of guernsey jersey while henry be fighting at shrewsbury landed near plymouth plundered whole country round on news reaching of result of battle of shrewsbury at once burned plymouth to ground then re embarking sailed for france
