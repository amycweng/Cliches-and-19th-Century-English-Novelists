range stranger be large schooner tautness of spar rigging showed that be in beautiful order crossed line upon merchantman be sailing two mile in rear then bearing up followed in wake charlie stood near captain who instead of watching be sweeping horizon with glass presently paused gazed intently at distant object thought so said to first officer fancied that fellow be alone must hardly have ventured to try strength with if have be send man up to top let see what can make out to be can only see topmast can make out yard presently lookout came down reported that distant vessel appeared to be large fore aft schooner bearing down upon will not be up for two hour yet captain said will be getting dark then be not likely will engage at night will keep close show teeth at daybreak soon became known that belief of captain be that vessel in wake that must be seen approaching on beam be french privateer soon be preparing in own way for what might happen sailor cleared deck loosed gun gentleman went below shortly returned bringing up rifle fowling piece small arm cutlass be brought up piled round mast why put on more sail sir mr ashmead member of council said to captain wife sir object to sound of firearm must really beg that will increase speed a be be losing rather than gaining upon vessel behind duty of ship of company be to try not to fight if can help captain added quietly not to fight if can help mr ashmead unfortunately choice upon present occasion lie with gentleman yonder not with be not of slightest use adding to sail carry for at very best speed schooner must sail round round a night come on intend to shorten sail put ship into fighting trim in morning will again increase will not make attempt to escape combat depends entirely on privateer to bring on not a choose be sorry mr ashmead must be exposed to unpleasantness of listening to explosion of firearm that other lady passenger must be exposed to danger can not arise more le from naval conflict however hope sir that there need be great anxiety a to result company have given heavy armament may be sure that will do best seeing gentleman go below for gun charlie asked one of other young writer lad of about own age named peter with whom have become very friendly to go below with have not yet examined arm that uncle have given for have not thought of since saw gun case under berth on first arrival on board ship found doctor already in cabin putting together heavy double barrelled gun well youngster said so be likely to have brush see have couple of gun case under berth be good deal

heavy charge ought to carry bullet far true have have practice not with gun sir used sometimes to practise shooting at gull with musket on board cutter father commanded got to be fair shot with then ought to be able to do good work with piece a what be in other case ah be beauty too said a examined double barrelled gun made extra strong heavy see so a to carry bullet will find shoulder ache at first will get accustomed to in time be always in favour of heavy barrel shoot stronger straighter than light gun be not so liable to get bent bruised if stupid servant drop one across stone after two three pound difference in weight doe not make material difference when be accustomed to although grant heavy gun doe not come quite so quickly up to shoulder for snap shot now peter charlie said take double barrel will use rifle mine will come into play first a uncle said when gave yours will do most execution at close quarter at dusk schooner having exchanged signal by flag took up position one on quarter of ship at distance of two mile think charlie asked friend doctor that be likely to try board tonight doctor said privateer generally depend upon long gun know that will be on watch night that in hand to hand fight must lose considerable number of men while by keeping at distance maintaining fire with long gun rely upon crippling opponent then ranging up under stern pouring in fire at close quarter until surrender thing be that prefer daylight a can then see whether other vessel be approaching be one of cruiser to hear cannonade in night must come down take unaware think will see at daylight if coast be clear will begin such be evidently captain opinion also a ordered sail to be still further shortened save watch on deck to turn in at once light be extinguished not that captain have idea of evading pursuer that wished to avoid offering mark for fire must approach in darkness chapter brush with privateer night passed quietly once twice light be seen a schooner showed lantern for moment to notify exact position to other a soon a dawn broke man on board lizzie anderson be at post schooner have drawn up little be still under easy sail moment that day grew clear enough for to be perceived that other sail must be seen above horizon fresh sail be spread upon schooner began rapidly to draw up on previous evening four heavy gun have be brought aft indiaman must have made long running fight with opponent have captain be disposed to however objected strongly a vessel be sure to be hulled knocked about severely perhaps of mast cut down be confident in power to beat off two privateer therefore did not add stitch of canvas to easy sail under have be holding on night presently puff of smoke shot out from bow of schooner from weather quarter followed almost instantaneously by one from consort two round shot struck up water one under indiaman stern other under forefoot rascal be well within range captain said quietly see be taking off canvas again intend to keep at distance hammer away at just what thought must be tactic two more shot be fired by schooner one flew over deck between mast plunged harmlessly in sea beyond other struck hull with dull crash be lucky lady be sent into hold captain said that shot have gone right through cabin now lad have got sight well upon fire four thirty two pounder spoke out almost at same moment gazed over bulwark anxiously to watch effect cheer arose a be seen how accurate have be aim of gunner one shot struck schooner to windward in bow foot two above water level went through foresail close to mast foot more must have cut foremast asunder vessel to leeward have be struck by only one shot other passing under stern be struck just above deck line shot passing through bulwark a thought on board merchantman narrowly missing if not actually striking mainmast there be damage done dr rae said keeping glass fixed on vessel there be good deal of running about on deck there be evident that display of heavy metal carried by indiaman be unpleasant surprise to privateer lowered sail ceased firing there be then rapid exchange of signal between like captain said laughing see that can not play game expected that have got to take a well a to give now depends upon sort of stuff captain be made of whether give up at once come straight up to close quarter ah mean fighting a spoke cloud of canvas be spread upon schooner sailing more than two foot to merchantman one ran quickly down towards firing rapidly a came only merchantman heavy gun replied worked steadily coolly did considerable damage bowsprit of one of opponent be shot away sail of vessel be pierced in several place several ragged hole be knocked in hull if be not that wish to sacrifice of life on board unnecessarily captain said must let come alongside try boarding have strong crew with sixty soldier must give reception a dream of however will keep off if can now mr james said to first officer propose to give vessel to leeward dose be keeping about abreast by course be making will range alongside at about cable length when give word pour broadside with gun to port upon weather schooner at moment gentleman said

deck with grape a pas will mr barlow order men to be in readiness to open fire with musketry upon a pas schooner be now running rapidly down upon indiaman be only able to use gun in bow fire of indiaman from heavy gun on quarter be inflicting more damage than received let hand lie down on deck captain ordered will open with broadside gun a come up when give word let gun on port side be trained at foot of mainmast fire a get line on starboard side lie down till give word be pretty sight a schooner throwing water high up from sharp cut water came running along heeling over under breeze a ranged alongside topsail came down broadside from be poured into indiaman great ship shook a shot crashed into several sharp cry told of effect have be produced then captain gave word moment afterwards irregular broadside a captain of gun brought piece to bear be poured into schooner from gun on port side a privateer heeled over deck must be plainly seen shot of indiaman directed at one point tore up hole around foot of mainmast in instant spar tottered with crash fell alongside at same moment three of passenger took steady aim over bulwark at helmsman of other privateer simultaneously with report of piece man be seen to fall sprang forward to take place again rifle spoke out fell beside comrade freed from strain have counteracted pressure of mainsail schooner flew up into wind indiaman held on course for length then helm be put up swept down across bow of privateer then men leaped to foot soldier lined bulwark a passed along few yard only distant from foe gun poured storm of grape along crowded deck while troop passenger kept up continuous fire of musketry will do captain said quietly now may keep on course have have more than enough of there be doubt of

seventy four gun pembroke of sixty hospital ship apollo be totally lost rest of fleet scattered in direction cope entered tanjore territory found whole population attached to new rajah be useless for therefore to march upon tanjore be really strong town so marched down to devikota where hoped to find of fleet not ship however be to be seen a without gun cope must hing returned here a have just taken possession again then went to fort saint david there be great discussion among bigwig be clear from what cope said that man have not friend in own country still a pointed out devikota be most important place for madras fort saint david have harbour devikota therefore where largest ship must run up river anchor must be of immense utility to a be really reason for have gone into affair be

major lawrence have very high opinion of so selected to lead storming party really seems almost a if have charmed life lawrence gave thirty three english soldier seven hundred sepoys rest of force be to follow a soon a clive party gained entrenchment clive led way with european with sepoys supporting behind got across rivulet with loss of only four men waited on other bank till saw sepoys climbing up then again led english on in advance towards unfinished part of entrenchment sepoys however did not move remained waiting for main body to come up enemy let clive twenty nine men get on distance in advance then cavalry who have be hidden by projection of fort charged suddenly down on be upon men before have time to form in minute twenty six of be cut to piece clive other three managed to get

devikota be few day later captured fortified temple of uchipuran hundred men be left there be afterwards attacked by rajah of tanjore with five thousand men held own beat off very gallant business that affair showed rajah that english must fight point hitherto native have be somewhat sceptical about be afraid of french looked upon a mere trader have too other thing to trouble a to state of carnatic so hastened to make peace agreed to pay expense of war to cede devikota territory round to allow wretched ex rajah in whose cause have pretended to fight pension of four hundred year on condition that kept shut up in one of fort not very nice business on side be still have gained point with exception of ex rajah who be bad lot after one be discontented when peace be signed force returned to fort saint david while have be away there have be revolution in carnatic now be rather complicated business a whole situation at present turn upon will not improbably cause expulsion from southern india will explain to a well a can now must know that southern india with exception of strip along west coast be governed by viceroy appointed by emperor at delhi be called subadar of deccan up till end of 'forty eight nizam ul mulk be viceroy about time died emperor appointed grandson muzaffar jung who be son of daughter of to succeed subadar have left five son four of lived at delhi be content to enjoy life there second son however nazir jung be ambitious man who have rebelled even against father naturally rebelled against nephew be on spot when father died while new subadar be absent nazir therefore seized rein of government resource of state emperor have trouble enough of own at delhi muzaffar have hope of aid from therefore went to satarah court of mahratta to ask for assistance there met chunda sahib man be nephew of last nawab of carnatic dost ali dost ali have be killed in battle with in afterwards captured trichinopoli took chunda sahib who commanded there prisoner have since kept at satarah have be at liberty must no doubt have succeeded uncle whose only son have be murdered a be at subadar of deccan bestowed government of carnatic upon anwarud din

sahib nawab of carnatic muzaffar jung conferred upon dupleix sovereignty of eighty one village adjoining french territory muzaffar after paying visit to pondicherry remained in camp with army twenty mile distant from place chunda sahib remained a guest of dupleix at pondicherry on receipt of news of battle of ambur mr floyer who be governor at fort saint david sent at once to chunda sahib to acknowledge a nawab in opinion of everyone here be very foolish step muhammud ali have fled to trichinopoli sent word to mr floyer that must hold place even reconquer carnatic if english must assist know that admiral boscawen who be with fleet at fort saint david urged mr floyer to do so a be clear that chunda sahib must be mere tool in hand of french when chunda sahib delayed week after week at

morning of th clive reached conjeveram town of size forty two mile from madras here clive gained first trustworthy intelligence a to arcot found garrison outnumbered own force by two to one that although defence be not in position to resist attack by heavy gun be capable of being defended against force not so provided clive at once despatched messenger to madras begging that two eighteen pounder might be sent after then without awaiting coming marched forward against arcot chapter siege of arcot from conjeveram to arcot be twenty seven mile troop in spite of delay caused by tremendous storm of thunder lightning reached town in two day garrison struck with panic at sudden coming of foe when deemed in absolute security at once abandoned fort might easily have maintained until chunda sahib be able to send force to relieve city be incapable of defence after fort have be abandoned clive took possession of without firing shot at once set to work to store up provision in fort in found eight gun abundance of ammunition a foresaw likelihood of having to stand siege there then leaving garrison to defend in absence marched on th of september with rest of force against enemy who have retired from town to mud fort of timari six mile south of arcot after few discharge with cannon retired hastily clive marched back to arcot two day later however found that have be reinforced a position threatened line of communication again advanced towards found enemy about two thousand strong drawn up in grove under cover of gun of fort grove be inclosed by bank ditch fifty yard away be

fell back upon arcot again until eighteen pounder must arrive for next eight day troop be engaged in throwing up defence strengthening victualling fort enemy gaining confidence gathered to number of three thousand encamped three mile from town proclaiming that be about to besiege at midnight on th clive sallied out took by surprise dispersed two eighteen pounder for clive have sent to madras be now well upon road under protection of small body of sepoys be approaching conjeveram enemy sent considerable body of troop to cut off gun clive found that small number have sent out to meet approaching party must not be sufficient therefore resolved to take whole force leaving only sufficient to garrison fort post enemy occupied be temple near conjeveram a be twenty seven mile distant

sentry over gateway perceived something approaching challenged immediately afterwards fired sound of gun seemed to serve a signal for assault large body of men rushed forward at gate while at two other point force ran up to foot of wall endeavoured to plant ladder garrison at once collected at point of attack few sentry only being left at interval on wall to give notice must attempt be made elsewhere from wall heavy fire of musketry be poured upon mass below while from window of house around answering flash of fire shot out rain of bullet being directed at battlement doctor rae commanded

endeavoured to hew way with ax through so steady be fire directed from loophole commanded upon so engaged that be time forced to recoil with great slaughter be not until nearly daybreak that attack ceased assailant finding that must not carry place by coup de main fell back next day main body of british force returned with convoy news arrived following day that enemy be approaching to lay siege to place news of capture of arcot have produced effect clive have anticipated from alarmed irritated besieger of trichinopoli inspired besieged with hope exultation mahratta chief of gutti rajah of mysore with whom muhammud ali have for time be negotiating at once declared in favour rajah of tanjore chief of pudicota adjoining that state who have hitherto remained strictly neutral now threw in fortune with english thereby secured communication between trichinopoli coast chunda sahib determined to lose not moment in recovering arcot knowing that recapture must at once cool ardour of new native ally of english that with capture last hope of besieged in trichinopoli must be at end continuing siege despatched three thousand of best troop with hundred fifty frenchman to reinforce two

head for moment without running risk of being shot only few sentinel be kept upon wall to prevent risk of surprise have to remain stooping below parapet day added to loss captain clive have series of wonderful escape indeed men began to regard with sort of superstitious reverence believing that have charmed life one of three remaining officer seeing enemy taking deliberate aim at through window endeavoured to pull aside native changed aim officer fell dead on three other occasion sergeant who accompanied on round be shot dead by side yet ball touched provision have be stored in fort before commencement of siege sufficient for sixty day of third be already exhausted when on th of october french troop serving with riza sahib received two eighteen pounder seven smaller piece of artillery hitherto besieger have contented with harassing garrison night day abstaining from attack must cost life until arrival of gun upon receiving at once placed in battery have prepared on northwest of fort opened fire so well be battery placed so accurate aim of gunner that very first shot dismounted one of eighteen pounder in fort second again struck gun completely disabled besieged mounted second heavy gun in place be preparing to open fire on french battery when shot struck also dismounted be useless to attempt to replace be during night removed to portion of wall not exposed to fire of enemy battery besieger continued fire in six day have demolished wall facing battery making breach of fifty foot wide clive who have now only two young subaltern serving under worked indefatigably coolness confidence of bearing kept up courage of little garrison night when darkness hid from view of enemy sharpshooter men laboured to prepare for impending attack work be thrown up inside fort to command

breach outside two held in reserve placed two small gun have found in fort when took on flat roof of house in fort commanding inside of breach from roof of of house around fort besieger beheld progress of defence riza sahib feared in spite of enormously superior number to run risk of repulse knew that amount of provision clive have stored be not large thinking that famine must inevitably compel surrender shrank from incurring risk of disheartening army by slaughter unsuccessful attempt to carry place must entail determined at rate to increase probability of success utilize superior force by making assault at two point simultaneously therefore erected battery on southwest began to effect breach on side also clive on part have be busy endeavouring to obtain assistance native emissary penetrating enemy line carried news of situation of affair in fort to madras fort saint david trichinopoli at madras few fresh troop have arrived from england mr saunders feeling that clive must be relieved at cost however defenceless state of madras might be despatched on th of october hundred european hundred sepoys under lieutenant innis after three day marching arrived at trivatoor

admiration a afterwards said have never before believed that english must fight when clive messenger reached at once sent back promise of assistance riza sahib learned almost a soon a clive that mahratta be on move prospect of communication being harassed by daring horseman filled with anxiety murari reo be encamped with six thousand men at spot thirty mile to west of arcot might at moment swoop down upon besieger although therefore riza sahib have for six day be at work effecting new breach be now nearly open to assault sent on th of october flag of truce with offer to clive of term if must surrender arcot garrison be to be allowed to march out with arm baggage while to clive offered large sum of money in case of refusal threatened to storm fort put defender to sword clive returned

captain kilpatrick who have hundred fifty english troop with four field gun be now advancing four day later new breach have attained width of thirty yard clive have prepared defence in rear similar to at other breach difficulty of besieger must here be much greater a ditch be not fordable fifty day siege have lasted have be terrible one for garrison never daring to expose unnecessarily during day yet ever on alert to repel attack labouring at night at defence with number daily dwindling prospect of assault becoming more more imminent work of little garrison be terrible be to defence of lucknow

trichinopoli when news of rising reached be expecting considerable number of fresh troop from england a be in january that majority of reinforcement despatched by company arrived in india mr saunders have written to calcutta begging that hundred men might be sent thence be now with eighty men at madras two hundred at arcot force must be at disposal for at fort saint david there be not single available man with effort clive aided by authority must make be not until middle of february that have completed arrangement on th hundred men arrived from bengal without loss of day clive started from madras to form junction with garrison from arcot who leaving only small force to hold fort have moved down to meet chapter battle of kavaripak troop from arcot have already moved distance on way to madras clive therefore with new levy joined on day after leaving french riza sahib let slip opportunity of attacking body before united be well aware of movement have resolved upon tactic calculated in first place to puzzle english commander to wear out troop to enable finally to surprise take entirely at disadvantage junction with arcot garrison raised force under clive order to three hundred eighty english thirteen hundred sepoys six field gun while enemy at vendalur place twenty five mile south of madras where have fortified camp have four hundred french troop two thousand sepoys two thousand five hundred cavalry twelve gun hoping to surprise there clive marched night when force approached town heard that enemy have disappeared that have started apparently in several direction force be halted for few hour then news be obtained that enemy have united force at conjeveram that have marched away from place in westerly direction doubting not that be about to attack arcot weakened by departure of greater portion of garrison must be in position to defend against sudden coup de main by strong force clive set troop again in motion french indeed have already bribed of native soldier within fort who be to reply to signal made without if be in position to open gate however by good fortune treachery have be discovered when french arrived received reply to signal a arcot must be sure to fall if defeated clive marched away without attacking to take up position have agreed upon beforehand be at nine in evening clive at vendalur obtained intelligence that enemy have assembled at conjeveram troop have already marched twenty five mile have have rest of five hour clive started with at once reached conjeveram twenty mile distant at four in morning finding that enemy have again disappeared ordered troop to halt for few hour have already marched forty five mile in twenty four hour great feat when be remembered that only arcot garrison be in way accustomed to fatigue others being newly raised levy greater portion of sepoys have be enlisted within fortnight preceding know mr marryat whether french call fighting call playing hide seek tim kelly said shure have bin marching with only halt of two three hour since yisterday morning poor foot be that sore dare take boot off for be shure 'd never git on agin if french want to fight why do square honest not be racing chasing about like lot of wild sheep have seen moonshee tim be with baggage shure saw tim said cart come in just now there be perched up on top of like dried monkey want tonight shure yer honor oh want tim 'd better go now get to sleep at once if can may be off again at minute arcot be twenty seven mile from conjeveram clive felt certain that enemy have gone on to place anxious a be for safety be absolutely necessary that troop must have rest before starting on march be therefore allowed to rest until twelve o'clock when refreshed by eight hour halt breakfast started upon long march towards arcot making sure that must not find enemy until reached that place have clive possessed body of cavalry however small must have be able to scour country to make acquainted with real position of french cavalry be to general what eye be to man without be liable to tumble into pitfall such be case on present occasion having doubt that enemy be engaged in attacking troop be plodding along carelessly in loose order when to astonishment after sixteen mile march a approached town of kavaripak just a sun be setting fire of artillery opened upon from grove upon right of road two hundred fifty yard distant nothing be more confusing than surprise of kind especially to young troop when enemy be thought to be near french general plan have be well laid have reached kavaripak that morning allowed troop to rest day expected to obtain easy victory over tired men who must unsuspicious of danger be pressing on to relief of arcot so far calculation have be correct english marched unsuspiciously into trap laid for twelve french gun be placed in grove round whose side facing point from clive be approaching ran deep ditch with high bank forming regular battery body of french infantry be placed in support of gun with sepoys in reserve behind grove parallel with road on left ran deep watercourse now empty in rest of infantry be stationed at point near town of kavaripak about quarter of mile further back than grove on side of watercourse enemy have placed powerful cavalry force for moment when gun opened there be confusion panic among british troop clive however ever cool confident in danger well seconded by officer rallied at once position be one of extreme danger be possible indeed to retreat in face of enemy superior in infantry gun possessing so powerful body of cavalry operation must have be very dangerous one even if accomplished must entail immense loss of morale prestige to troop hitherto under leading have be always successful belief in own superiority add immensely to fighting power of soldier even must remnant of force fight way back to madras campaign must have be lost one hope of saving trichinopoli must have be at end steady lad steady shouted form up quietly steadily have beaten enemy before know will do so again while troop in spite of artillery fire fell into line clive rapidly surveyed ground saw enemy infantry advancing up watercourse so sheltered by a to be out of fire of troop saw cavalry sweeping down on other side of watercourse menacing left threatening baggage gun be at once brought up from rear before arrived men be falling fast three of gun placed to answer french battery two of hurried to left with small body of english two hundred sepoys to check advance of enemy cavalry main body of infantry ordered into watercourse afforded shelter from enemy artillery baggage cart baggage sent mile to rear under protection of forty sepoys gun while be being done enemy fire be continuing infantry advanced slowly have not reached point abreast of grove when british force in watercourse met must not seem to be very important matter at what point in watercourse infantry of two opposing party came into collision matter apparently trifling in often decide fate of battle in fact have french artillery retained fire until infantry be abreast of grove battle of kavaripak must have be won by british power in southern india must have be destroyed clive moved confidently resolutely among men keeping up courage by cheerful word be well seconded by officer now lad charlie marryat cried to company of be in command stick to ought to be very thankful to french for saving trouble of having to march twelve mile before giving opportunity of thrashing men laughed redoubled fire on french infantry who be facing in watercourse at distance of eighty yard party liked to charge french commander knew that have only to hold position to win day gun be mowing down english artilleryman english party on left of watercourse with difficulty held own against charge of horseman be rapidly dwindling away under artillery fire while other body of cavalry have surrounded baggage be attacking little force told off to guard knew too that attempt english might make to attack battery with strong defence must inevitably fail situation be becoming desperate be now ten o'clock fight have gone on for four hour advantage have be gained men be losing confidence position grew more more desperate clive saw that there be one chance of victory grove must not be carried in front be just possible that might be open in rear choosing sergeant who spoke native language well bade leave party in watercourse make way round to rear of grove discover whether be strongly guarded there not in twenty minute sergeant returned with news that there be strong force there clive at once took two hundred of english infantry men who have fought at arcot quietly left watercourse made way round towards rear of grove before have gone far main body in watercourse surprised at sudden withdrawal of greater portion of english force missing presence of clive began to lose heart no longer replied energetically to fire of french infantry movement of retreat began fire ceased in minute two must have broken in flight at moment clive returned a moved forward have marked dying away of english fire guessing what have happened have given over command of column to lieutenant keene senior officer hurried back to watercourse arrived there just a troop have commenced to run away throwing among with shout exhortation succeeded in arresting flight by assurance that battle be a good a won elsewhere that have only to hold ground for few minute longer to ensure victory got to advance to former position to reopen fire on french who have fortunately remained inactive instead of advancing taking advantage of cessation of english fire in meantime lieutenant keene led detachment making long circuit to point three hundred yard immediately behind grove then sent forward one of officer ensign symmonds who spoke french perfectly to reconnoitre grove symmonds have proceeded little way when came upon large number of french sepoys who be covering rear of grove who a service be not required be sheltering there from random bullet be flying about at once challenged symmonds answering in french being unable to see uniform in darkness supposing to be french officer allowed to advance passed boldly forward into grove proceeded nearly through until came within sight of gun be still keeping up fire upon of english while hundred french infantry who be in support be occupied in watching what be going on in front of symmonds returned to detachment by path to right of by have entered passed out without seeing soul lieutenant keene gave word to advance following guidance of mr symmonds entered grove advanced unobserved until within thirty yard of enemy here halted poured volley into effect be instantaneous many of french fell rest astounded at sudden unexpected attack left gun fled sixty of rushed for shelter into building at end of grove where english surrounded forced to surrender by sudden stroke battle of kavaripak be won sound of musketry fire immediate cessation of of enemy gun told clive that grove be captured few minute later fugitive arriving from grove informed commander of enemy main body of infantry of misfortune have befallen french fire at once ceased troop withdrew in darkness be impossible for clive to attempt pursuit be in ignorance of direction enemy have taken troop have already marched sixty mile in two day must moreover have be exposed to sudden dash of enemy cavalry clive therefore united troop joined baggage little guard have gallantly defended against attack of enemy cavalry waited for morning at daybreak not enemy be to be seen fifty frenchman lay dead on field sixty be captive three hundred french sepoys have fallen there be besides many wounded enemy artillery have be all captured british loss be forty english thirty sepoys killed great number of wounded moral effect of victory be immense be first time french english soldier have fought in field against other in india french have proved to native that be enormously superior in fighting power hitherto english have not done so defence of arcot have proved that must fight behind wall native have many example of gallant defence of kind english troop under gingen cope have suffered to be cooped up in trichinopoli have not struck blow in defence at native discovered that english must fight a well better than french latter be somewhat stronger numerically than rival have double force of artillery be half a strong again in sepoys have two thousand five hundred cavalry while english have not single horseman have advantage of surprise position yet have be entirely defeated thenceforth native of india regarded english a people to be feared respected for first time considered ultimate triumph over french to be possibility a policy of native prince have ever be to side with strongest advantage thus gained to english cause by victory of kavaripak be enormous on following day english took possession of fort of kavaripak marched to arcot scarcely have arrived there when clive received despatch from fort saint david ordering to return there at once with troop to march to relief of trichinopoli where garrison be reported to be in sorest strait from want of provision force reached fort saint david on th of march here preparation be hurried forward for advance to trichinopoli in three day clive be ready to start just a be about to set out ship arrived from england having on board more troop together with major lawrence several officer of whom be captain senior to clive major lawrence who have already proved capacity energy of course took command of expedition treated clive who have served under at siege of pondicherry whose success in field have attracted high admiration a second in command somewhat to discontent of officer senior to in rank force consisted of four hundred european eleven hundred sepoys eight gun escorted large train of provision store during month diversion caused by attack of riza sahib french upon madras have given to besieger of trichinopoli must have long since captured town in spite of order of dupleix law must not bring to attack town french governor of pondicherry saw with dismay that two month half effort energy have gained for besieger have be entirely wasted that be probable whole fruit of labour must be thrown away now directed law to leave only small force in front of trichinopoli to march with whole of army that of chunda sahib crush force advancing under lawrence to relief of trichinopoli law however disobeyed order indeed acted in direct contradiction to maintained six hundred french troop many thousand of native before trichinopoli sent two hundred fifty french about three hundred fifty native force altogether inferior in number to be sent to oppose to arrest progress of lawrence advancing column position french force be directed to occupy be fort of koiladi admirable position a two branch of kavari be here mile apart have law concentrated force here must no doubt have successfully opposed english lawrence however when gun of fort opened upon replied to by fire of artillery a french force be insufficient to enable commander to fight in open be enabled to take troop convoy in safety past fort when law heard marched out took position round lofty almost inaccessible rock called elmiseram prepared to give battle lawrence however after passing koiladi have be joined by hundred english fifty dragoon from trichinopoli acted a guide led by route by avoided french position effected junction with two hundred european four hundred sepoys from trichinopoli with body of mahratta cavalry under murari reo law having failed to attack english force upon march now when strength be nearly doubled suddenly decided to give battle advanced against force wearied with long march have just begun to prepare breakfast french artillery at once put mahratta cavalry to flight lawrence called men again under arm sent clive forward to reconnoitre found french infantry drawn up with twenty two gun with large body of cavalry on flank opposite to centre of position be large caravansary native inn with stone building attached be nearer to position than to occupied by english clive saw at once that if seized held by enemy artillery must sweep whole ground over english must have to advance galloped back at full speed to major lawrence asked leave at once to occupy building obtaining permission advanced with speed to caravansary with gun infantry negligence of french in allowing movement to be carried out be fatal to english artillery opened upon from cover of inn building to fire french in open must reply only at great disadvantage after cannonade lasting hour french having lost forty european three hundred native soldier fell back english having lost only twenty one disheartened at result utterly disappointed at failure have attended long operation against trichinopoli without energy decision law at once raised siege of town abandoning great portion of baggage destroying great store of ammunition supply crossed arm of kavari took post in great fortified temple of seringam delight of troop so long besieged in trichinopoli inactive dispirited hopeless be extreme exultation of muhammud ali native ally be le captain cope towards end of siege have be killed in one of little skirmish occasionally took place with french charlie marryat peter have owing to of officer senior to being killed invalided to large number of fresh recruit being raised received step in rank be now lieutenant commanded body of sepoys two hundred strong at charlie request tim kelly be detached from company allowed to remain with a soldier servant after retreat of french settling down of english force in line have occupied charlie friend entered trichinopoli be surprised at temple palace there although very inferior to tanjore in way even comparable to city of northwest of india trichinopoli be far more important city than have hitherto seen ascended lofty rock visited fort on summit looked a if in hand of resolute garrison must be impregnable to attack manner in rock a well a of elmiseram others lying in sight rose sheer up from plain filled with surprise for although natural rock fortress be common enough in india be almost without example in europe after visiting fort rambled through town be amused at scene of bustle in street at gay shop full of article new curious to in bazaar be wonderfully clever ingenious charlie said look what rough tool that man be working with what delicate intricate work be turning out if fellow must fight a well a work be united among not only must be unable to set foot in india emperor with enormous army must be able to raise must be able to threaten europe suppose never have be really good fighting men alexander couple of thousand year ago defeated since then afghan other northern people have be always overrunning conquering ca make out sepoys after only few week training fight almost a well a own men wonder how be that when commanded by own countryman be able to make so poor fight of have better be going back to camp again peter at moment there may be order for to do something with major lawrence clive together be not likely to stop here long inactive chapter fall of seringam although called island seringam be in fact long narrow tongue of land running between two branch of river kavari in place arm be few hundred yard apart island can therefore be defended against attack along land retreat of french by line be equally difficult a held narrowest part of neck two mile from koiladi upon south force at trichinopoli faced french across river upon other side of kolrun a northern arm of kavari be called french must cross river make retreat if necessary in direction two principal road however led from paichandah strong fortified position on bank of river facing temple of seringam clive saw that force crossing river taking up position on north must entirely cut off law army in island must intercept reinforcement sent by dupleix to rescue might compel surrender of whole french army attempt must of course be dangerous one french force be considerably stronger than english be latter divided into two portion entirely cut off from other central point between being occupied by french latter must have opportunity of throwing whole force upon one after other danger must have be so great have french be commanded by able active officer attempt must never have be made law however have shown amply that have energy intelligence major lawrence therefore accepted clive proposal to be successful be necessary that portion of english force must be well commanded major lawrence felt confident in own capacity to withstand law upon southern bank in case of necessity must fall back under gun of trichinopoli felt sure that must with equal certainty confide command of other party to captain clive there be however difficulty that be junior captain present already great jealousy have be excited among senior by rank occupied in council of lawrence fortunately difficulty be settled by native ally major lawrence laid plan before muhammud ali ally whose cooperation assistance be absolutely necessary after hearing proposal agreed to give assistance only upon condition that clive must be placed in command of expeditionary party have already seen paralysing effect of incapacity of english officer clive defence of arcot victory of arni kavaripak have excited intense admiration caused to place unbounded confidence in therefore said if captain clive command will go unless command major lawrence be glad that pressure thus placed upon enabled without incurring charge of favouritism to place command in hand of officer upon whom most relied on night of th of april clive set out with force composed of four hundred english seven hundred sepoys three thousand mahratta cavalry thousand tanjore cavalry six light gun two heavy one descending river crossed island at point three mile to east of law camping ground marched to samieaveram town nine mile north of island commanding road from north east movement be just made in time dupleix utterly disgusted with law have resolved to displace d'auteuil only officer have of sufficient high rank to take place have not when previously employed

convoy to seringam where be to take command when arrived within fifteen mile of samieaveram learned that clive have possession of village determined upon circuitous route by might avoid therefore sent

wishing to fight battle in open with superior force fell back to utatua while clive returned to samieaveram law too have received news of clive movement here be chance of retrieving misfortune of campaign paichandah being still in hand must sally out with whole force that of chunda sahib seize samieaveram in clive absence extend hand to d'auteuil fall upon clive rear instead of repeated

to surrender to rajah of tanjore who have several time intrigued secretly with rather than to muhammud ali english whom regarded a implacable enemy have placed in hand life must have be safe be murdered by treacherous rajah within twenty four hour of surrender with fall of seringam terminated contest for supremacy of carnatic between english french fighting respectively on behalf of puppet muhammud ali chunda sahib stage of struggle be not final one by circumstance by prestige acquired in eye of native gave moral ascendency even when fortune be afterwards at worst be never lost again muhammud ali have gained little in struggle be indeed nominally ruler of carnatic have to rely for position solely on support of english bayonet indeed promise of have be obliged to be lavish to native ally to keep faithful to cause when cause seemed lost now came upon to trouble so precarious be position that be obliged to ask english to leave two hundred english troop fifteen hundred of

triumphant soil surrounded by wall of saint david alone remained to english in southern india in five year have elapsed have changed english be master of carnatic french be broken discredited english be regarded by native throughout country a coming power of great change slight portion be due to energy genius of clive chapter important mission few day after return of expedition against covelong chengalpatt charlie received note from governor saunders requesting to call upon at eleven o'clock charlie of course attended at government house at time named found captain clive with mr saunders have sent for mr marryat to ask if be ready to undertake delicate somewhat dangerous mission captain clive tell that be convinced that will be able to discharge duty satisfactorily have be giving highest report of conduct courage tell that speak language with facility have be working hard sir charlie said have have moonshee for last year a except when on duty have spoken nothing native language with can now speak almost a fluently a can english so captain clive have be telling mr saunders said be indeed on ground that select for service friend mr peter have equally distinguished in field captain clive tell be greatly inferior in knowledge of vernacular be indeed case peter have little natural aptitude for foreign language after working hard for time with moonshee found that be making so little progress in comparison with charlie that lost heart although have continued lesson with moonshee have done so only to extent of hour so day whereas charlie have devoted whole leisure time to work fact of case be mr marryat owing to failure of muhammud ali to fulfil ridiculously onerous term extorted from by of native ally during siege of trichinopoli several of be in state of discontent be likely soon to break out into open hostility rajah of mysore tanjore be have learned already in communication with pondicherry will believe shortly acknowledge son of chunda sahib whom dupleix have declared ruler of carnatic murari reo have already openly joined french influence in deccan be now so great that bussy may be said to rule there now there be chief named boorhau reo whose territory lie among hill extends from plain nearly up to plateau land of deccan position like of many of other small rajah be precarious in day like present when might make right petty state try to make profit out of constant war at expense of neighbour position of chief surrounded by dozen others more powerful than be by mean pleasant boorhau reo feel that be in danger of being swallowed by nizam by mahratta earnestly desire to ally with believing a say that be destined to be master here have assured that although gratified at expression of friendship can enter into alliance with position of territory must enable to be of great assistance to in war in whole force of deccan controlled a be at present at bussy might be utilized against in carnatic must be able to harass convoy cut communication otherwise trouble enemy movement although see that aid must be very useful to in case of such war see how on part must give protection have now with greatest difficulty brought affair to successful conclusion in carnatic dupleix be active energetic well supported at home many of chief lately ally have a have just said declared against be about to do so be out of question for to think of supporting chief so far removed from a boorhau have therefore told that greatly desire friendship be at present powerless to protect must be attacked by northern neighbour be particularly anxious to train men after european fashion a see that sepoys be match for five time number of untrained troop of indian prince brings to subject before have written to to say will send to english officer capable of training leading troop whose advice may be useful to upon occasion that a be known that have received british officer be employing to train troop must excite instant animosity of bussy of peishwar must send one familiar with language who may pas a native captain clive have strongly recommended for difficult mission fear sir must hardly pas a native moonshee be constantly correcting mistake make in speaking may be so mr saunders said there be score of dialect in southern india must be passed upon nineteen of twenty people who speak a belonging to one of other if think sir that will do charlie said will be glad to undertake mission very well mr marryat be understood then will receive full instruction in writing will understand that duty be not only to drill troop of chief to give such advice a may suit interest to strengthen good feeling towards to form a far a possible compact little force might at critical moment be of immense utility will of course master geography of country of be absolutely ignorant find out about pass mountain path defensible position thing may someday be of highest importance will have few day to make arrangement settle a to character will adopt have better do in consultation with someone who thoroughly understands country be intended that will go down to trichinopoli with next convoy from there make way to stronghold of boorhau will take follower with yes mr saunders said a will go in character of military adventurer who have served among sepoys long enough to learn european drill have better take two three four men a like with a retainer might pick out two three trusty men from sepoys command charlie left government house in high spirit be certainly honor to have be selected for such post be quite possible that must be dangerous one be sure to be altogether different from ordinary life of subaltern in company army peter be very sorry when heard from charlie that be at last to be separated be now nearly two year since have first met on board lizzie anderson since time have be constantly together be greatly attached to other charlie perhaps have taken lead fact of having stock of firearm being able to lend to peter have given perhaps first slight almost imperceptible advantage feat of jumping overboard to rescue tim kelly have be step in advance although charlie must have denied there be doubt that generally took lead that friend be accustomed to lean upon to look to always for initiative be therefore severe blow to peter to find charlie be about to be sent on detached service a for tim kelly be uproarious in grief when heard that be to be separated from master shure mr charlie ye will never have heart to lave poor boy sarved ye be night day for eighteen month tim kelly must gladly give life for ye ye must go lave behind ye go alone among black thaves of world be impossible that can take tim charlie said know that can not speak ten word of language how then must possibly pas undetected disguise put on 'd never open mouth at at yer honor barring for mate drink be very well for to say so tim charlie answered think that anything short of miracle must silence tongue leave now tim will talk matter over with mr peter must be glad enough to have with if must arrange moonshee be taken into counsel be asked opinion a to disguise charlie must adopt with least risk of detection moonshee replied that might pas a bheel hill tribe speak dialect quite distinct from of people around moonshee said that if properly attired charlie must be able to pas anywhere for one of people provided always that did not meet with of same race might assert said that father have taken service with rajah on plain that have there learned to speak language in way must avoid having to answer difficult question regarding native place a to that can get up something of geography before leave there be several bheels among sepoys charlie said can pick out three four of who must be just men for to take believe be generally very faithful attached to officer when tim again entered room inquired anxiously if master hit upon disguise must suit what do say mr moonshine tim said moonshee shook head between two perpetual feud have existed ever since native have arrived at arcot to take place a member of charlie establishment in obedience to charlie stringent order tim never be openly rude to never lost opportunity of making remark of disparaging nature a to value of charlie study moonshee on part generally ignored tim existence altogether addressing when obliged to do so with ceremonious civility annoyed tim more than open abuse must have done think said gravely in reply to tim demand that very worshipful one must have most chance of escaping detection if went in rag throwing dust on hair passing for one afflicted what doe mean by afflicted mr charles irishman said wrathfully a two young officer laughed mean one who be born fool tim tim looked furiously at moonshee must latter said sententiously be character worshipful one must support with greatest ease black thief be making fun of tim muttered will be aven with one of day name be tim kelly be thinking yer honor might represent one deaf dumb be always talking tim when be not talking to others talk to yourself be quite impossible must go a dumb man might go a moonshee suggests a half witted sort of chap with just sense enough to groom horse look after with not enough to understand what be said to to answer question must do asy enough mr charles have to keep from quarrelling tim hear quarrelling on average ten time day a in such character a be talking about must of course be exposed to sort of slight unpleasantness must be in continual hot water now yer honor tim said reproachfully be too hard on entirely like bit of row a well a many be for divarsion must go on for year without quarrelling with soul just try mr charles just try for month if at end of time find in way that keep character then send back agin to regiment be arranged that moonshee must remain with peter who seeing that charlie owed appointment to post promised excitement adventure to skill in native language be determined that must again set to in earnest try master intricacy moonshee went down to bazaar purchased clothes must be necessary for disguise charlie found in company four sepoys who willingly agreed to accompany in character of retainer upon expedition a to costume there be difficulty when off duty sepoys in company service be accustomed to dress in native attire consequently needed only addition of tulwar short curved sword shield thrown over one shoulder long matchlock two three pistol dagger stuck into girdle to complete equipment charlie be dressed gaily in garb of military officer in service of indian rajah be to ride horse saddle gay housing be procured have at last given in to tim entreaty worthy be dressed a syce horse keeper charlie tim have have portion of skin exposed to air darkened must pas muster at casual inspection charlie in thus concealing nationality desired only to hide fact that be officer in company service believed that must be impossible for to continue to pas a bheel however must be of consequence after time many of native prince have european in service runaway sailor deserter from english french dutch armed force in possession on seacoast adventurer influenced either by love of life of excitement whom desire to escape consequence of folly crime committed at home have driven to roving life such men might be found in many of native court once settled then in service of rajah charlie intended to make little farther pretence secrecy a to nationality outwardly must still conform to language appearance of character have chosen must allow to be supposed that be englishman deserter from company service that comrade be sepoys in similar position employment then at court of rajah must have effect exact reverse of must have done have appeared in proper character deserter be of men most opposed to countryman to whom have proved traitor in battle must be relied upon to fight desperately for fought with rope round neck therefore while appearance of english officer a instructor of force of rajah must have drawn upon instant hostility of opposed to british circulation of report that troop be being disciplined by english native deserter from company force must excite suspicion to avoid attracting attention charlie marryat party set out before daylight from madras appearance indeed must have attracted attention when once have passed beyond boundary of portion of town occupied by white in native quarter appearance of small zemindar landowner attended by four five armed follower on foot be of such common occurrence a to attract attention whatever indeed number of come in to take service in sepoy regiment profession of arm being always considered honorable in india for fortnight travelled by easy stage without question suspicion being excited that be not what seemed be now among hill soon arrived at ambur seat of rajah town be small one above rose fortress stood on rock rising sheer from bottom of valley standing boldly out from hillside

shoulder joined rock zigzag road have be cut with enormous labour in face of rock to summit be strong place charlie said to tim kelly who be walking by horse head must be able to hold out against anything starvation be to say if properly defended be powerful place surely tim said must puzzle ould boy to take even captain clive who be afeard of nothing must be bothered by a rode up valley two horseman be seen spurring towards from town drew rein before charlie one bowing said master rajah sends greeting to begs to know if be illustrious soldier nadir ali for whom heart have be longing will tell lord that nadir ali be here charlie said that longs to see face of rajah one of horseman at once rode off other took place by side of charlie having introduced a captain of rajah bodyguard rode with through town have charlie appeared in character a english officer rajah troop must have turned out to do honor to arrival a be portion of garrison only appeared at gate lined wall through little

incline at turn there be gateway with little flanking tower on jingalls small wall piece commanded road faith then be fool that built place must like to have to attack wid soldier of king army let alone of company be tremendously strong tim be astonishing what brave men can do in after war england waged in india truth of what charlie said be over over again proved numerous fortress supposed by

be far beyond year who have learned art of war of infidel from beyond sea then inviting charlie to take seat on divan with questioned a to journey event be taking place in plain until attendant having handed round refreshment retired at signal be glad to see sahib said when be alone though in truth looked for one older than great english governor of madras tell however in letter received four day since that be skilled in war that fought by side of great captain clive at arcot arni kavaripak at trichinopoli that great warrior chose to come to therefore doubt valour prudence put in hand wholly governor have already told doubtless of position in be placed here governor saunders explained whole position to charlie said be at present menaced on side by powerful neighbour believe that fortune of english be on increase a think time may come ere long when will turn french out of deccan become master there a have already become master in carnatic wish to fight by side share fortune in meantime desire to be able to defend against neighbour for at present english be too far away to assist to enable to do have be sent to drill discipline troop like sepoys to give such advice a may be best for general defence of country have brought with five soldier four bheels one of countryman latter will be of little use in drilling troop for be ignorant of language have come a personal attendant other four will assist in work follower here will doubt discover in very short time be englishman let be understood that be deserter have be attracted to court by promise of high pay have assumed character of bheel lest being here might put on bad term with english charlie then asked rajah a to strength of military force in time of peace rajah said keep three hundred men under arm in case of taking field three thousand to defend ambur against attack of enemy must muster ten thousand men must not call out three thousand men without attracting attention of neighbour charlie asked rajah said must bring neighbour upon at once suppose however might assemble five hundred men without attracting attention oh rajah said eight hundred men be not force must attract great attention then must propose that begin with eight hundred charlie said for month however will confine to troop at present have must in first place train officer if will pick out to whom intend to give command subcommands will choose from men after drilling for few day forty of most intelligent a what call noncommissioned officer for first month will work hard in teaching officer sub officer duty then when whole eight hundred assemble can divide into four party there will be one of drill instructor to party ten under officer four five of officer whom will appoint six week hard work must make eight hundred men fairly acquainted with drill english sepoys have often gone out to fight with le at end of six week let five hundred men have called out in addition to bodyguard of three hundred return to home replace by equal number of fresh levy so proceed until have three thousand fighting men thoroughly trained in nine month will have have six week of exercise must take place in rank again at day notice two hundred of men will train in artillery although belong to branch of service learned duty at rajah agreed heartily to charlie proposal well pleased at thought that must before end of year be possessed of trained force must enable to hold own against powerful neighbour until opportunity might occur when in alliance with english must be able to turn table upon to aggrandize at expense chapter murderous attempt handsome room with suite of attendant be assigned to charlie in rajah palace be formally appointed commander of force four sepoys be appointed to junior rank a be also tim kelly who however insisted on remaining in position of chief attendant upon master being in fact sort of majordomo valet in one looking after comfort when in palace accompanying a personal guard whenever rode out niver know yer honor what native may be up to will smile with one day stab ye next be treacherous varmint yer honor if do give chance at first charlie perceived that position excited jealousy in mind of surrounding rajah therefore did in power to show to that in way aspired to interfere in internal politics affair of little state that be soldier nothing more urged upon rajah who wished to have always by that be far better that must appear to hold aloof to avoid appearance of favouritism of desire to obtain dominance in counsel of rajah wished that appointment to post of officer in new force must be made by rajah who must lend ear to advice of usual councillor once appointed must be under absolute command control that must have power to dismiss who proved indolent incapable to promote active energetic men wholly regardless of influence position next morning charlie four assistant set to work to drill three hundred men of garrison taking in party of twenty be thus able in course of few day to pick out most active intelligent for sub officer with existing officer of body new one appointed by rajah be at once taken in hand to be taught duty for month work went on steadily without interruption from morn till night courtyard echoed with word of command at end of time twenty officer forty sub officer have fairly learned duty native of india be very quick in learning drill regiment of newly raised sepoys will perform manoeuvre answer to word of command in course of fortnight a promptly regularly a must one of english recruit in three month good many change have taken place during month work many of officer became disgusted with hard continuous work to be unaccustomed while of sub officer showed deficiency of quickness intelligence needed for work place however be easily filled a day went on took increasing degree of interest a acquired facility of movement saw how quickly according to european method manoeuvre be gone through at end of month then sixty men be able in turn to instruct others body of five hundred men being called out work of drilling on large scale began drill ground now be level space in valley below town whole population assembled day after day to look on with astonishment at exercise four great company battalion a charlie called be kept entirely separate under command of one of sepoys under whom be proportion of officer sub officer evening charlie came down for hour put body through drill distributing blame praise a be deserved thus keeping up spirit of emulation between battalion at end of fortnight when simpler manoeuvre have be learned charlie for two hour day worked whole together a one regiment be surprised to find how rapid be progress day effected rajah often came down to drill ground took highest interest in work must fain have have regular uniform similar to worn by sepoys in service of european power provided for men charlie strongly urged not to do so admitted that troop must look immensely better if clad in regular uniform than a motley band dressed according to own fancy pointed out however that while news that rajah be having of men drilled by european deserter must attract little attention among neighbour report that be raising sepoy battalion must certainly be received by in hostile spirit by mean charlie said get uniform made for whole force keep by in store can be at once served out in case of war sight of number of sepoy battalion where expected only to meet irregular force will have immense effect upon force opposed to rajah saw force of argument at once ordered five thousand suit of white uniform similar to worn by sepoys in english french service to be made stored up in magazine while lieutenant be drilling main body charlie took in hand party of forty picked men instructed in use of field gun superiority of european in artillery be one of reason gave to such easy victory in early battle with native force in india latter possessed very powerful artillery in point of number there be regular drill manner of loading be in habit too of allowing gun to cool after be fired before being loaded again be thought therefore good practice if gun be discharged once in quarter of hour be then utterly astounded dismayed at effect of european gun of must be loaded fired twice even three time minute so month passed after month until rajah boorhau be in position to put if necessary five battalion of sepoys seven hundred strong into field with thirty gun served by trained artilleryman so quietly have work gone on that attracted attention among neighbour mere rumour that rajah have european deserter in service that be drilling four five hundred men be considered of so little moment that passed altogether unheeded account of state of affair in carnatic reached charlie be not satisfactory dupleix with usual energy be aiding son of chunda sahib with men money in combat with british protege most of native ally of latter have fallen away from trichinopoli be again besieged fortune of england lately so flourishing be waning again in deccan french influence be supreme bussy with strong well disciplined french force maintained salabut jung whom french have placed on throne against opponent at one time be peishwar at mahratta against whom bussy turned arm always with success french have acquired four district on coast known a northern sircas be in vain that charlie endeavoured to gain accurate knowledge of political position so quickly continually did change at one time peishwar nizam a subadar of deccan be now called must be fighting in alliance against one other of mahratta chief at time must be in conflict with other while rajah of mysore murari reo other chief be sometimes fighting on one side sometimes on proud of rapidly increasing force boorhau reo must more than once in course of year have joined in warfare going on around charlie however succeeded in restraining from doing so pointing out that victor of one day be vanquished of next that be worse than useless to join in struggle of condition be so uncertain change of fortune so rapid that none must count upon others for aid however great assistance might have rendered only short time before be to gain territory rajah might perhaps largely do from efficient aid might render to one party other must be object of hostile combination against must not hope to struggle rajah yielded at once to charlie argument influence of latter added to hostility favour shown by rajah have provoked among many of leading men of state where side be often so closely balanced a be case in intestine struggle aid of rajah however small following be sought by one other of combatant counsellor of able to place respectable force in field be heavily bribed by one side other around rajah boorhau found effort completely baffled by influence of english commander of force faction of increasing strength power be formed to overthrow rajah have kept secret well one two only of adviser knew that englishman be trusted agent of company soldier be much attached to english leader found always just firm complaint be always listened to tyranny ill treatment by officer suppressed punished merit rewarded among officer strictness of discipline alienated many who contrasted easy life have led before introduction of european system with now endured so long a be engaged in mastering rudiment of drill felt disadvantage when be acquired thought capable of taking place of english adventurer of leading troop have organized to victory already charlie have received several anonymous warning danger threatened rajah be knew warm friend in delight at seeing formidable force have be formed from irregular levy have presented a token of gratitude with large sum of money in day be method by indian prince rewarded european officer who rendered service be considered by mean derogatory to latter to accept money be indeed universal custom charlie knowing captain clive have received large present of kind have hesitation in following example treasure stored up by many of indian prince be immense lac of rupee equivalent to ten thousand pound be considered by mean large present charlie foreseeing sooner later little state must become involved in hostility took precaution of forwarding money have received down to madras sending piecemeal in charge of native merchant trader be by paid into madras treasury where large rate of interest for monies lent by employee be given by company for at home felt uneasiness be very seldom that letter reached learned that be still in high favour with uncle that mother continued installed at head of house that girl be at excellent school charlie mentioned to rajah rumour have reached of plot against rajah assured of own support under circumstance offered that strong guard must be placed night day over apartment occupied charlie declined guard can always be corrupted said irish servant sleep in anteroom four lieutenant be close at hand knowing that soldier be for most part attached to think that open force will be used will however cause large bell to be suspended above quarter ringing will be signal be attacked in case rely upon highness putting at head of guard coming to assistance tim kelly be at once furious alarmed at news that danger threatened master took precaution that must imagine to ensure safety took

apartment be empty having fled with men who have attacked gate of palace consisted partly of soldier whom have bribed of desperado from town who have singly entered fort during day have be concealed in apartment of conspirator until signal for attack be given intention of conspirator be not only to kill englishman to dethrone rajah install brother in place attack have commenced with attempt upon charlie life because be believed that death must paralyse troop who be faithful to rajah at end of six week charlie be able to resume duty appearance at parade ground be hailed with enthusiastic shout by soldier rajah be more attached to than ever have again made large present in token of regret felt at suffering have endured in cause drilling be now carried on with redoubled energy large number of new levy have be summoned to standard storm be gathering over rajah brother be raising force to attack have by mean of large promise in case of success persuaded murari reo to take up cause have be said also sent message to nizam pointing out that in case of war with english rajah of ambur must be thorn in side told of number of troop who have be drilled how formidable such force must be if opposed to at critical moment while if claimant gained power army of ambur must be at disposal of nizam rajah on side have also sent messenger to hyderabad with assurance to nizam of fidelity friendship urged that preparation have made be intended solely for defence of state against marauding band of mahratta especially against of murari reo who be scourge to neighbour in meantime effort be made to strengthen defence of ambur wall surrounding town be repaired although in must have offered slight defence to determined assault approach to town be covered by gun of fort above weak point of defence be hill behind town sloped up gradually to point higher than level of projecting rock upon castle stood then rose in rugged cliff two hundred foot higher then fell away again steeply to summit be too far back for fire of gun placed upon to injure castle town gun placed however at foot of rocky wall must dominate castle render at last untenable charlie have often looked with anxious eye at point one morning accompanied by rajah rode up to examine position highest point of slope at foot of crag be nearly opposite castle be here that active enemy making way along slope must place gun here charlie determined to establish battery news have arrived that rajah brother have raised force of three thousand men that with seven thousand mahratta be about to march force charlie felt certain that must meet defeat in open more disquieting news be that bussy hearing that rajah troop have be trained by englishman have advised nizam to declare for rival to send considerable force to assistance if necessary fresh messenger be sent off with new assurance of rajah loyalty to nizam may not do much good charlie said if can induce to remain quiet until have defeated murari reo will be so much gained charlie despatched messenger to mr saunders begging assistance might be sent to rajah having decided upon position for battery energetic step be taken to form space large enough for construction of battery for tent store of artilleryman two hundred infantry be marked out rajah ordered whole population of ambur men woman child to assist at work troop too be employed under charlie superintendence wondrous change be soon effected spot chosen be levelled strong earthwork be erected round then surrounding ground be removed be work of immense labour ground consisting first of layer of soil then of debris have fallen from face of rock above stone boulder to depth of fifteen foot under be solid earth slope resembled anthill soldier able bodied men broke up boulder rock with sledgehammer when necessary with powder blasted rock when needed woman child carried away fragment in basket work lasted for fortnight at end of position of almost impregnable nature be formed at foot of earthwork protecting gun at face side ground composed of great boulder stone sloped steeply out forming bank fifteen foot deep at foot again solid rock be blasted away so a to form deep chasm thirty foot wide ten foot high round foot of fort for hundred yard on side earth stone have be entirely removed down to solid rock ten gun be placed in battery fire of swept slope behind town castle rendering impossible until fort be carried for enemy to attack town on side to operate in way against only point at attack must be made upon castle rajah be delighted at most formidable accession to defensive power of fortress be now in position to defy attack must be made against store of provision ammunition be collected there command given to one of charlie sepoy lieutenant with hundred trained artilleryman two hundred infantry number of cattle have be driven into town castle store of provision collected be two day after battery be complete that news arrived that rajah brother with murari reo have entered rajah dominion be marching up valley to assault rajah have in first place wished to defend strong gorge through enemy must have to pas having hitherto be considered defensible point of capital against invasion charlie pointed out however that although doubt successful defence might be made here must only be repulse must leave enemy little weakened for further operation argued that be better to allow to advance to point where valley opened out into plain two mile wide have doubt that rajah troop must be able to inflict crushing defeat upon invader who must be so disheartened thereby that must be little likely to renew attack two body of troop three hundred strong be sent down to gorge with order to remain in hiding among height to allow invading army to pas unmolested then to inflict greatest possible loss upon a returned be under command of of charlie lieutenant who received order from to erect breastwork of rock on slope above entrance to gorge after enemy have passed on to line with portion of men who must pour heavy fire into enemy a came down valley while rest be to line height above gorge to roll down rock upon who passed through fire of comrade uniform be served out to soldier charlie surveyed with pride five battalion of trained troop with twelve gun marched down into valley took up post beyond at point have carefully chosen where gun of castle must be able to play upon advancing body of troop body of trained artilleryman be told off for service last raised levy be posted in castle on wall of town position be so chosen that flank of line rested on slope on side be broken by inclosure garden into on side battalion be thrown forward so a to deliver flanking fire upon enemy advancing against centre across valley two hundred yard in front of position stream watered made sharp turn running for distance directly across several small canal for irrigation of field rendered ground wet swampy across line occupied by troop breastwork have be thrown up in front of row of sharp pointed stake have be stuck in ground altogether position be formidable one hour two after position so carefully prepared have be taken up large body of mahratta horse be seen dashing up valley smoke rising from several point showed that have begun usual work of plundering destroying village on way few discharge from field piece in castle have be ordered to be silent until raising of white flag gave signal to open fire checked advance of horseman waited until infantry must arrive force of murari reo be at time most formidable of purely native army of southern india recruited from desperado from mahratta tribe well disciplined by leader have more than once fought without defeat against body of european while have in case obtained easy victory over other native army presently horseman opened compact body of three thousand mahratta infantry accompanied by equal number of irregular of rajah brother advanced to attack while cavalry at side swept down upon flank of rajah position thirty piece of artillery opened fire not shot be fired in return charlie ordering men to lie down behind breastwork until received word of command to show mahratta horseman compelled by bend of stream to keep near foot of slope came forward in gallant style until suddenly from wall clump of bush on slope above tremendous fire of musketry broke out while twelve field gun six of be posted on side of charlie centre poured destructive fire into so deadly be rain of iron lead that mahratta horseman instantly drew bridle leaving ground strewn with dead galloped back by time infantry covered by fire of artillery have reached stream be waist deep bank be two foot above level a scrambled up after crossing from line of embankment in front of tremendous fire be opened although mowed down in score seasoned warrior of mahratta chief cheered on by voice a recklessly exposing rode among pressed forward ever increasing number gained footing across stream in front keeping up heavy fire at breastwork whose face be ploughed by cannon shot a advanced gun of castle opened fire not upon in front for be too near line of entrenchment upon struggling mass still crossing stream into ceaseless fire of musketry be poured from slope on flank still mahratta infantry struggled bravely on until within few yard of entrenchment then suddenly with mighty shout rajah troop leaped to foot poured volley from crest of breastwork into enemy then with fixed bayonet flung upon effect be decisive mahratta have at commencement of fight scarcely outnumbered troop of rajah in front of have derived little assistance from levy of ally who indeed have contented with keeping up fire upon defender of slope have already suffered very severely charge made upon along whole line be irresistible before bayonet crossed broke fled hotly pursued by troop of rajah in accordance with charlie order did not scatter kept in close line four deep advanced pouring tremendous volley into foe in vain did murari reo endeavour to rally men infantry order lost fled at top of speed flight covered by cavalry who sacrificed in two three brilliant charge right up to line of pursuer although suffering terribly from withering volley poured into rank troop be now formed into heavy column rapidly marched down valley after flying enemy hour later sound of heavy firing be heard in front at redoubled speed troop pressed onward when arrived however at gorge found that last of fugitive have passed through ground in front be strewn with dead dying for a mass of fugitive have arrived at gorge infantry from above have opened fire upon several time frightened throng have recoiled at last impelled by greater fear of pursuer behind have dashed forward through fire only to fall in hundred in gorge crushed beneath rain of rock showered down upon from above chapter siege of victory be complete decisive one thousand of best troop of murari reo have fallen besides hundred of irregular ally whose loss be incurred almost wholly at gorge in retreat rajah be in highest state of delight at splendid result obtained by european training of troop proud of victory over such formidable opponent be full of enthusiasm for young english leader rejoicing in ambur night be great felt confident that danger be at end what think rajah said to charlie a long feast at end sat together in divan smoking narghileys will be result when news of defeat of murari reo reach hyderabad be difficult to say charlie replied be possible of course that may be considered that be better to leave in peace upon other hand may be that will consider that be so formidable power that be absolutely necessary to crush at once rather than to give chance of joining against in war must sooner later take place between english in case will be very different affair from have have today still must send off messenger tomorrow to acquaint nizam with defeat inflicted upon mahratta who have invaded to assure again of loyalty to beg to lay authority upon murari reo not to renew attack ten day later messenger arrived from nizam ordering rajah to repair at once to hyderabad to explain conduct latter sent back message of humble excuse saying that health be so injured by excitement of recent event that be unable to travel that when recovered must journey to hyderabad to lay respect at foot of nizam two three day later messenger arrived from mr saunders with letter to charlie in expressed great satisfaction at defeat murari reo have received defeat must for time keep quiet so relieve strain upon english affair have said since departure of clive for england be going badly dupleix have received large reinforcement english have suffered several revers mr saunders begged to assure rajah of respect friendship of england to give promise that if must be driven from capital must be received with honor at madras must be reinstated in dominion with much added territory when english be again in position to take field in force to settle long feud with french ten day later heard that army of nizam of fifteen thousand troop with eight hundred french under bussy be marching against that horseman of murari reo be devastating village near frontier council of war be held charlie must fain have fought in open again believing that trained troop flushed with recent victory must be match even for army of nizam rajah rest of council alarmed at presence of french troop who have hitherto proved invincible against vastly superior force of native shrank from course be decided that must content with defence of town castle order be accordingly issued that old men woman child must at once leave town under guard of one battalion of troop take refuge in almost impregnable hill fort mile away one battalion be placed in garrison in castle other three with irregular took post in town whence must if necessary retreat into castle day following removal of noncombatant enemy appeared coming down valley having marched over hill while mahratta cavalry again poured up from below charlie have taken command of town a be against that effort of enemy must be first directed be imposing sight a army of nizam wound down valley great mass of men with gay flag elephant with gold embroidery of trapping glistening in sun band of horseman careering here there line of artillery drawn by bullock le picturesque far more menacing dark body of french infantry who formed nucleus heart of whole camp be pitched just out of range of gun of fort soon line after line of tent gay with flag floated above rose across valley charlie have mounted to castle better to observe movement of enemy presently saw small body of horseman ride out of camp mount hillside across valley glass showed that of be native officer while others be in dark uniform of french have doubt charlie said to rajah be nizam with bussy gone up to reconnoitre position wonder how like look of wish must have turfed battery above newly stripped land might in case have given pleasant surprise a be be hardly likely to begin by attack along slope in rear of town will see that will commence attack at farther face of town battery above can not aid in defence there although castle may help will only be by direct fire if try to carry place by coup de main think can beat off must succeed by regular approach must inflict a much loss a can then fall back however will be sometime before come next morning charlie found that enemy have during night erected three battery on slope facing north wall of town farthest removed from castle at once opened fire gun on wall facing replied while on castle hurled shot over town into enemy battery for three day artillery fire be kept up without intermission gun on wall be too weak to silence battery of besieger although be much annoyed by fire from fort dismounted four of gun blew up one of magazine several time town be set on fire by shell from french mortar charlie have organized irregular into band with bucket succeeded in extinguishing flame before spread seeing that mud wall of town be crumbling rapidly before besieger fire charlie set troop to work levelled house within fifty yard of with stone beam formed barricade across end of street beyond many of gun from other portion of wall be removed placed on barricade end of house be loopholed be prepared for desperate defence charlie experience at arcot stood in good stead imitated measure taken by clive at place when defence be completed raised second line of barricade distance further back here when assault be expected placed one of battalion with order if inner line of entrenchment be carried must allow defender of post to pas through then resist until town be completely evacuated when be to fall back upon fort have however little fear that position must be taken at first assault upon evening of third day besieger fire have done work gap in wall eighty yard wide be formed garrison be ordered to hold in readiness strict watch be set towards morning distant hum in nizam camp proclaimed that troop be mustering for assault besieger gun have continued fire night to prevent working party from placing obstacle in breach a first shade of daylight appeared fire ceased great column of men poured forward to assault few remaining gun upon end wall opened upon a did infantry who lined parapet while gun in castle at once joined in mighty column however composed of troop of nizam pressed forward poured over fragment of wall entered clear space behind then from housetop loophole from wall on side concentrated fire of musketry be poured upon while twelve gun four on barricade swept with grape head of column withered away under fire long line be swept through crowded mass after minute two wild firing at concealed foe troop of nizam appalled shattered by tremendous fire broke fled instant have cleared breach gun of besieger again opened furiously upon to check sortie besieged might attempt hour later besieger hoisted white flag requested to be allowed to bury dead remove wounded charlie agreed to with proviso that must be carried by own men beyond breach a did not wish that enemy must have opportunity of examining internal defence task occupied time a more than five hundred dead dying lay scattered in open space during rest of day enemy showed sign of resuming assault during night must be heard hard at work although brisk fire be kept up to hinder charlie found that have pushed trench from battery considerable distance round corner of town for four day besieger worked vigorously harassed a be by gun of fort by of battery high up on hillside be now able to take in flank work across upper angle of town at end of time have erected armed two battery at daylight opened upon wall formed flank of clear space behind breach although suffering heavily from fire of besieged losing many men battery kept up fire unceasingly night day until great gap have be made in wall charlie be obliged to withdraw troop from behind line of barricade during time fire of battery in front have be unceasing have destroyed most of house formed connecting line between barricade night however besieged worked to repair damage to fill up gap thus formed with pile of stone beam so that by end of fourth day after repulse of first assault line of barricade stretched across line of defence enemy time prepared to attack by daylight early in morning whole army of nizam marched to assault heedless of fire of castle formed up in long line of heavy mass along slope one huge column moved forward against main breach two advanced obliquely towards great gap in wall on side latter column be headed by body of french troop in vain gun of fort aided by of battery on hill swept column advanced without check until entered breach then line of fire swept along crest of barricade from end to end cannon of besieged roared out pressed by mass from behind column advanced torn rent by fire at last gained foot of barricade here in front strove desperately to climb up great mound of rubbish while behind covered with storm of bullet aimed at summit more than once troop of rajah rushing down embankment drove back struggling mass so heavily did suffer from fire when thus exposed that charlie forbade to repeat attempt knew that there be safety behind be unwilling that brave fellow must throw away life in centre of position native troop although several time climbed distance up barricade be yet unable to make way french troop at flank be steadily forcing way up many have climbed up by ruin of wall from top be firing down on defender of barricade inch by inch won way up barricade already thickly covered with dead then charlie seeing that men be beginning to waver gave signal long blast of trumpet be heard even above tremendous din in instant barricade be deserted defender rushed into house partition wall between on lower floor have already be knocked down without suffering from heavy fire assailant opened a soon a gained crest of barricade defender retreated along covered way until in rear of second line of defence be held by battalion placed there until whole of defender of town have left by gate leading up to fort then charlie withdrew battalion also town remained in hand of enemy who have lost charlie reckoned fully fifteen hundred men in assault during fight tim faithful hossein now fully recovered promoted to rank of officer have remained close beside be with last to leave town instant evacuation be complete gun of hill battery opened upon town tremendous fire of musketry be poured upon from point of castle commanded while gun from lofty elevation must not be depressed sufficiently to bear upon town directed fire upon body of troop still beyond wall enemy have captured town indeed possession aided little in assault upon fort only advantage gave must have be that must have enabled to attack lower gate of fort protected by outer wall from fire of hill battery charlie have however perceived that must be case have planted number of mine under wall at point be exploded when defender of town entered fort hundred yard of wall be thus destroyed leaving space across enemy must advance to attack of gate exposed to fire of hill battery a well a of numerous gun of fort bearing upon two day passed without further operation on part of enemy then bussy seeing that nothing must be done towards assaulting fortress so long a battery remained in hand of besieged determined to make desperate effort to carry ignorant of immense strength at night therefore ordered two body of men fifteen hundred strong to mount hillside far to right left of town to move along at foot of wall of rock to carry battery by storm at daybreak charlie believing that attempt must be made have upon day following fall of town taken post there have ordered most vigilant watch to be kept up night placing sentry hundred yard away on side to give warning of approach of enemy towards daybreak on third morning shot upon left followed few second later by one on right told that enemy be approaching minute two afterwards sentry ran in climbed from ditch by ladder have be placed there for purpose hauling up after be soon in battery with news that large body of enemy be approaching on flank scarcely be garrison at post when french be seen approaching at once broke into run gallantly led dashed across space of cleared rock in spite of heavy fire of musketry grape when came however to edge of deep gulf in solid rock paused have have idea of meeting with obstacle a be easy enough to leap down impossible to climb up steep face ten foot high in front of in dim light must be plainly seen be however impossible for in front to pause pressed upon by behind who did not know what be stopping large number be compelled to jump into trench where found unable to advance retreat by time gun on upper side of castle have opened on assailing column taking in flank while fire of battery be continued without moment intermission bussy who be commanding one of column pushed way through struggling soldier to edge of trench when seeing impossibility of scaling side unprovided a be with scaling ladder gave order to retreat column harassed by flanking fire of gun of castle pursued by of battery retreated having lost hundred of number besides hundred fifty of best men prisoner in deep trench around battery be summoned to surrender resistance being impossible at once laid down arm ladder be lowered to be marched a prisoner to fort next morning when defender of fortress looked over valley great camp be gone nizam bussy despairing of possibility of carrying position at once so enormously strong by nature so gallantly defended have raised siege have cost over two thousand of best soldier including two hundred french killed prisoner retreated to plateau of deccan exultation of rajah troop be unbounded felt that now henceforth be safe from invasion rajah saw that in future must be able to gain greatly increased territory a ally of english gratitude to charlie be unbounded literally loaded with costly present three week later letter be received by latter from mr saunders congratulating upon inestimable service have rendered appointing to rank of captain in company service now that rajah must be able to protect must future assault be made upon event most unlikely to happen a bussy nizam must be unwilling to risk repetition of defeat have already so greatly injured prestige have better return to madras where a mr saunders said service of so capable officer be greatly needed warned however to be careful in extreme how made way back a country be in most disturbed state mahratta band being everywhere out plundering burning subsequent information that mahratta be swarming in plain below determined charlie to accept offer rajah made that must under strong escort cross mountain make way to port on west

right at be done for look pirate fleet be already sailing away do think english will take fort yer honor know tim place be tremendously strong built on rock there be gun bear right down on ship if venture in close while theirs will do little damage to solidly built wall suwarndrug ought to resist fleet ten time a strong a before shure then yer honor will have to remain here life do ye think tim hope not besides think that ought to be able to render assistance to how will do yer honor have to spake word tim kelly be ready to go through fire water so be hossein ye may be shure of seeing that pirate be now mustering round gun that ship be ranging up for action charlie thought prudent to retire hitherto attention have be paid to 't be probable enough that when pirate blood became heated by fight must vent fury upon captive therefore advised not only native officer sailor to retire to casemates a gun placed in did not command position taken up by ship be at presented untenanted by of garrison presently noise of gun proclaimed that engagement have begun boom of cannon of ship be answered by incessant fire from far more numerous artillery of fortress while now then heavy explosion close at hand told of bursting of bomb from mortar vessel in fortress charlie have be thinking of best measure to be taken to aid friend ever since squadron came in sight after sitting quietly for hour called officer around be convinced said that if unaided from within ship will have chance whatever of taking fortress think that may help upper fort contains magazine command whole of interior gun bear upon ship where be anchored probably place at present be almost deserted a one pay attention to propose with tim kelly ten english sailor to seize can close gate discharge gun upon defender of sea face must not of course defend for five minute if attacked must threaten to blow up magazine if did so propose that tomorrow morning four hossein will strip to loincloth just before becomes light go along wall stop up with piece of wood touch hole of a many of cannon a can must not do to use nail even if have one will notice in dark that be not mahratta if scatter about may manage to close up four five gun at least be know desperate service if discovered will be instantly killed if succeeds pirate scared by discovering just a ship open fire that number of gun be disabled while take in rear from fort behind may not improbably surrender at once at rate be worth trying for one must rather run risk of being killed than be condemned to pas life slave of pirate who may at moment cut throat in case of reverse happening to four native officer at once stated willingness to join in plan hossein did not consider reply necessary with be matter of course to do charlie suggested latter then went into next casemate unfolded plan to sailor who heartily agreed to make effort for liberty fire continued day unabated at nightfall when man a usual brought captive food exultingly told that damage have be effected by gun of fleet in evening party cut number of piece of wood measuring by cannon in casemate made of just sufficient size length to push down with slight effort through touch hole when pushed down to full length touched interior of cannon below be just level with top of touch hole thus must be next to impossible to extricate in hurry might indeed be broken forced in by solid punch of same size a touch hole must take time must not be likely to occur on moment to pirate skewer for be what resembled be very strong tough being made of slip of bamboo prisoner have knife used for cutting food with work be accomplished towards morning five native with skewer hidden away in loincloth turban twisted in mahratta fashion stole out from casemate charlie

there be dozen men there led on again charlie leaped upon edge of parapet shouted if attack will blow up magazine have to lift hand magazine will be fired boldest of assailant be paralysed by threat confusion reigned throughout fortress fleet kept up fire with great vigour judging by feebleness of reply that something unusual must be happening within wall gunner disheartened by finding piece useless unable to extract wooden plug while charlie men continued to ply with grape left gun with greater portion of garrison disorganized panic stricken retired into shelter shell from ship falling

men woman child including two hundred of own countryman leave at mercy of enemy forget whom be speaking to sir mr drake said angrily forgot nothing sir charlie replied trying to speak calmly then sir mr holwell have charged that if however must not believe for moment to be possible refuse to move up ship to receive garrison on board that must at least order boat up a must be amply sufficient to carry away even in daytime there must be no danger for ship at night at least boat might come up without being exposed to risk will certainly hing of sort mr drake said danger be even greater for boat than for ship be sir to return to garrison of fort with news that utterly desert that intend to remain quietly here while be sacrificed before eye be possible that be capable of such infamy a infamy exclaimed three men rising to foot place in arrest at once for insolence mr drake said despise arrest a do did not believe possible charlie said at last giving vent to anger scorn england will not believe that three englishman so cowardly so infamous a yourselves be to be found a for captain minchin if ever after come across will flog publicly first shoot afterwards like dog if dare to meet a

arm conveyed to zenana lady apartment of one of nabob general few day later english captive be conveyed to moorshedabad where rajah also returned after having extorted large sum from french dutch confiscated whole of property of english in bengal prospect be gloomy one for captive that english must in time return extort heavy reckoning from nabob did not doubt for moment nothing be more likely than at news of first disaster befell troop nabob must order captive to be put to death upon march up country charlie have by cheerfulness good temper gained goodwill of officer commanding guard upon arriving at destination recommended so strongly to commander of prison that latter instead of placing in apartment allotted to remainder of prisoner assigned separate room to permitting tim at request to occupy with be room of fair size in tower on one of angle of wall have bar did not prevent behind looking out at country stretched around governor of prison finding that charlie spoke language fluently often came up to sit with conversing with on affair of unknown country england altogether be fairly treated food be plentiful beyond captivity have little to complain of over over again talked about possibility of effecting escape on entering prison have noticed how good be watch how many strong door through have passed have meditated upon making rope escaping from window slept on divan with rug to cover torn into strip twisted must not reach quarter of way from window to ground there be other material of rope must possibly have be formed only hope charlie said one day be in hossein be sure will follow to death if did know where be confined must not be certain rest day night till have opened communication with see tim there be regimental cap with gold lace let fasten outside bar with thread from rug of course must remove when hear anyone coming be speedily done for next few day one other remained constantly at window mr charles tim exclaimed in great excitement one day there be man have be watching for last half hour seems to be picking up stick while keep getting nearer nearer two three time seems to that have looked up in direction charlie joined tim at window yes tim be right that be hossein be pretty sure man have now approached within two three hundred yard of corner of wall be apparently collecting piece of dried brushwood for firing presently glanced in direction of window charlie thrust arm through bar waved hand man threw up arm with gesture to casual observer must have appeared accidental watcher have doubt be intended for be still too far off from to be able to distinguish feature have not least doubt that be hossein chapter daring escape what be to be done next mister charles be hossein sure enough bring much nearer to getting out first thing be to communicate with in way tim if 'd come up to side of moat yer honor might spake to must never do tim there be sure to be sentry on wall of prison must trust to can see sentry will know best what can do be evident that hossein did not intend doing anything at present for still stooping gathering brushwood gradually withdrew farther farther from wall then saw make stick into bundle put on shoulder walk away during rest of day saw more of hossein will write charlie said fortunately have pencil telling that can lower light string down to moat if can manage to get underneath with cord can hoist up that must have two disguise in readiness think hossein can read tim said more than can myself daresay not tim will probably have friend in town there be men who be employed in english factory at kossimbazar hard by will be out of employment will regret expulsion of english can trust hossein at rate will get ready now first thing have to do be to loosen one of bar wish have thought of doing before however stonework be pretty rotten will have difficulty about that first thing be to get tool of sort looked round room for time saw nothing must in way serve wall floor wide bench running round upon cushion served a bed be laid be stone there be other furniture of kind divil bit of iron do see in place mister charles tim said even give knife for dinner stew meat into smash there be something tim charlie said looking at door look at long hinge hinge be of ornamented ironwork extending half across door upon one of scroll of ironwork set to work chipping small piece of stone off angle of wall outside window with great difficulty thrust under end of scroll a wedge piece slightly larger be then pushed under gain be almost imperceptible at last piece of iron be raised from woodwork sufficiently to allow to get hold of with thumb then little by little bent upward until at last must obtain firm hold of rest be comparatively easy iron be tough strong by bending up down succeeded at last in breaking off be lower hinge of door upon have operated a loss of piece of iron there must be le likely to catch eye of anyone coming in collected dust from corner of room moistened rubbed on to wood so a to take away freshness of appearance then set to work with piece of iron be of curved shape about three inch long inch wide eighth of inch thick taking by turn ground away stone round bottom of one of bar for first inch stone yielded readily to iron below became harder progress be slow filled hole have made with water to soften stone worked steadily away till night when to great joy found that have reached bottom of bar then enlarged hole inwards in order that bar might be pulled back fortunately be much decayed by age have doubt that by exerting strength together must bend sufficiently to enable to get through at hour when dinner be brought have ceased work filled up hole with dust collected from floor put dust of stone over smoothed down so that must not have be noticed by anyone casually looking from window be late at night before finished work hand be sore bleeding be completely worn out with fatigue have saved from dinner good sized piece of bread folded up into small compass leaf from pocketbook upon charlie have written in hindostanee letter to hossein thrust into centre of piece of bread then charlie told tim to lie down rest for three hour while kept watch a must take in turn night to listen in case hossein must come outside lamp be kept burning just a charlie watch be over thought heard very faint splash in water below two three minute later again thought heard sound peered out of window anxiously night be dark must see nothing listening intently seemed to several time that heard same faint sound presently something whizzed

straight at enemy camp must take quite unprepared even if know a daresay do that be close at hand must lose advantage of artillery yes if have arrived hour before sunset so a to be able to learn something of nature of ground must be best course major coote agreed even if troop have be fresh night attack on unknown position be hazardous undertaking good night must see clive take last order at daybreak english be astir position of enemy became visible occupied strongly intrenched work rajah dulab ram have thrown up during stay right of work rested on river extended inland at right angle to

position of english french with four field gun took up post on mound of tank nearest to grove about mile distant from in narrow space between river two heavy gun under native officer be placed behind french gun be division of mir mudin khan one faithful general of nabob consisted of five thousand horse seven thousand foot extending in arc of circle towards village of plassey be troop of three traitor general rajah dulab ram yar lutf khan meer jaffier thus english position be almost surrounded in advancing against camp must have to expose to attack in rear by troop of conspirator general have between nearly thirty eight thousand troop from roof of hunting box clive watched progress of enemy movement saw at once that position have taken up be one must entail absolute destruction of force must be defeated that depended entirely upon course taken by conspirator against force a opposed to if remained faithful to master success must hardly be hoped for however be now too late to retreat only course be to show bold front clive accordingly moved troop out from mango tree to line with hunting box european be formed in centre with three field piece on side native troop be on flank two field gun two howitzer be placed little in advance of hunting box facing french position on mound at eight o'clock in morning of rd of june memorable day in annals of india preparation on

continued to play on dense mass of enemy however well might be handled must do little against fire of fifty piece of cannon concentrated upon have be served by european artilleryman british force must have be speedily annihilated a stood native of india however be extremely clumsy gunner fired slowly have feeblest idea of elevation consequently ball for most part went far over head of english four field gun of saint frais did more execution than fifty heavy piece of nabob at end of hour however clive have lost thirty of men determined to fall back to mango grove leaving party in hunting box in brick kiln in front of in gun have be posted to harass saint frais battery with musketry fire withdrew rest of force into grove here be in shelter for be surrounded by high thick bank behind men sat

did not suffer at although top of tree be cut off in direction by storm of cannon ball swept through although english fire be producing considerable loss among enemy be a nothing in comparison to enormous number at eleven o'clock clive summoned principal officer around be agreed that a meer jaffier associate of whose position in field be ignorant showed sign of drawing off of treachery to master be impossible to risk attack upon front since must a pressed forward be enveloped by force in rear be determined therefore that unless unexpected circumstance occurred must hold present position till must at midnight attack enemy camp quarter of hour later tremendous tropical shower commenced for hour rain came down in torrent gradually enemy fire slackened english have tarpaulin to cover ammunition therefore suffered injury native have such covering powder be soon completely wetted by deluge of rain mir mudin khan knowing that own gun have be rendered useless believed that of english be in similar condition leading out cavalry made splendid charge down upon grove english be in readiness a cavalry swept up flash of fire ran from thousand musket from top of embankment while of field gun sent load of grapeshot through embrasure into throng of horseman effect be decisive cavalry recoiled before terrible fire rode back with brave leader mortally wounded blow be fatal to fortune of suraja dowlah when news of death of brave faithful general reached be struck with terror have long suspected meer jaffier of treachery have now no one else to rely upon sending for general reminded in touching term of benefit have received at hand of father conjured to be faithful to throwing turban upon ground said jaffier must defend that turban jaffier responded with assurance of loyalty sincerity promised to defend sovereign with life then riding off at once despatched messenger to clive informing of what have happened urging to attack at once a long a mir mudin khan lived be probable that meer jaffier be still undecided a to part must play while general lived be possible even probable that english must be defeated even must traitor take part against death however left whole management of affair in hand of three conspirator course be now plain scarcely have meer jaffier left nabob than unhappy young man who be still under twenty year old turned to rajah dulab ram for counsel advice traitor gave counsel led to destruction told that english must not be attacked in position that troop exposed to fire of gun be suffering heavily losing heart advised at once to issue order for to fall back within intrenchment also advised to leave field to retire to moorshedabad leaving to general to annihilate english must venture to attack suraja dowlah at time capable of thinking for now bewildered by death of general knew to be faithful to by doubt a to fidelity of others fell into snare at once issued order for troop to retire within intrenchment then mounting swift camel accompanied by two thousand horseman left field rode off to moorshedabad movement of retirement at once commenced three traitor general drew off troop of mir mudin khan also obeyed order fell back saint frais however refused to obey saw ruin must follow upon retreat pluckily continued fire clive after council have decided that nothing must be done till have lain down in hunting box to snatch little repose thought having kept awake night major kilpatrick seeing retirement of enemy that french artilleryman remained unsupported on mound at once advanced with two hundred fifty european two gun against sending word to clive what be doing clive angry that officer must have taken so important step without consulting at once ran after detachment severely reprimanded major kilpatrick for moving from grove without order immediately however that comprehended whole position recognized wisdom of course kilpatrick have taken sent back to grove to order whole force to advance saint frais seeing that be entirely unsupported fired last shot then limbering up fell back in perfect order to redoubt at corner of intrenchment where again posted field piece in readiness for action looking round field clive saw that two of division formed arc of circle be marching back towards intrenchment that third on left of line have wheeled round be marching towards rear of grove not having received letter meer jaffier have written to supposed that movement indicated intention to attack baggage therefore detached european troop with field gun to check advance upon gun opening fire enemy

soldier inferior officer knowing nothing of treachery of chief be indignant at being thus cannonaded in intrenchment by foe so inferior in strength horse foot artillery poured out again from intrenchment attacked british battle now raged in earnest clive posted infantry artillery on mound of tank nearest to enemy intrenchment greater part of rest on rising ground two hundred yard to left of while placed hundred sixty picked shot european native behind tank close to intrenchment with order to keep up continuous musketry fire upon enemy a sallied out enemy fought bravely saint frais worked gun unflinchingly at redoubt infantry poured in volley after volley cavalry made desperate charge right up to british line have leader be fighting against men well commanded confident in clive

clive colleague have saddled crushed sum be so vast that be only by imposing most onerous taxation upon people that be enabled to pay discontent excited proved destruction omichund have greater reason for satisfaction at part have played in ruin of country fact that have be deceived by forged treaty be abruptly brutally communicated to blow broke heart shortly afterwards became insane died before

have just cause of complaint against from day of arrival of clive at calcutta be doomed be certain that nabob must not have remained faithful to engagement when danger wrung concession from have passed nevertheless whole of circumstance followed signature of treaty manner in unhappy youth be alternately cajoled bullied to ruin loathsome treachery in around engaged with connivance of english

where petty rajah have castle cavalry alone must however do little must be able to act a infantry must have couple of little four pounder to take about with force like must do more to keep order in
