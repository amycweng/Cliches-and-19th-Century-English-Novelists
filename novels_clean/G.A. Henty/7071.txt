generally agreed that must follow nullah down cross stream get into large canebrake beyond from must take hour to dislodge so general move be made to carriage in short time whole party be on way back to sandynugghur chapter ii outbreak week after boar hunt came news that sepoy named mangul pandy belonging to thirty fourth native infantry stationed at barrackpore place only few mile out of calcutta have on th of march rushed out upon parade ground called upon men to mutiny then shot european sergeant major of regiment cut down officer pandy continued to exhort men to rise to arm although comrade must not join refused to make movement to arrest general hearsey now arrived on parade ground with son major ross at once rode at man who finding that comrade must not assist discharged content of musket into own body two day later mutinous nineteenth be disbanded at barrackpore on rd of april mangul pandy who have only wounded be hung same doom be allotted to native officer of regiment for refusing to order men to assist officer attacked by mutineer for inciting men to rise against government what do think of news papa dick asked father hope that example have be set by execution of ringleader by disbandment of nineteenth may have wholesome effect dick will see before long needed great lapse of time to show that lesson have be ineffectual from nearly station throughout bengal northwest province came rumor of disaffection at agra at umballah at other place incendiary fire broke out with alarming frequency letter be from time to time intercepted calling upon sepoys to revolt while at lucknow serious disturbance occurred seventh regiment be disarmed by sir henry lawrence commissioner of oude so month of april passed a went on feeling of disquiet danger grew deeper more general be like anxious time preceding thunderstorm cloud be gathering how when must burst none must say many still maintained stoutly that there be danger whatever that whole thing must blow over men with wife family be generally inclined to take more somber view of case be to be wondered at british form almost inappreciable portion of population of india be isolated in throng of native outnumbered by thousand to one man might therefore well feel helplessness to render assistance to dear to in event of general uprising of people soldier without family tie take thing lightly be ready for danger for death if need be can always hope to get through somehow man with wife child in india at time when general outbreak be anticipated must have deepest cause for anxiety not however that at time one at sandynugghur looked for anything so terrible there be spirit of insubordination abroad in native troop doubt one doubted that must with more le trouble be put down so thing went on a usual garden party drive friendly evening visiting continued just a before be at one of pleasant evening gathering that first blow fell most of officer of station wife two three civilian be collected at major warrener window be open girl be playing duet on piano five six other lady be in drawing room about same number of gentleman be standing sitting by four five be lounging in veranda enjoying cheroot native servant in white dress moved noiselessly about with iced lemonade wine when sepoy came up walk what be asked major warrener who be one of group in veranda dispatch for colonel sahib

exclamation be groan cry good heaven what be matter colonel native troop at meerut have mutinied have murdered officer european men woman child must find be marching upon delhi look after regiment low cry broke from major be indeed awful news for moment two men sat half stunned at calamity while sound of music merry talk came in through open window like mockery on ear let take turn in compound said major where one can hear for hour walked up down garden there must be doubt about truth of news for be official telegram from adjutant at meerut a to extent of misfortune be terrible there be not single white regiment at delhi exclaimed colonel fiend will have own way at delhi there be score of european family delhi once in hand will be center mutiny will spread like wildfire over india what be general at meerut about what be white troop up to be a inexplicable a be terrible be there anything to be done major do think major warrener must think of nothing men at present knew nothing of news tidings must reach in two three day for news in india spread from village to village town to town with almost incredible speed meerut be hundred fifty mile distant have better tell inside major asked answered colonel let be happy for to night will know news to morrow a be breaking up ask officer to come round to messroom will meet there can talk matter over let lady have one more quiet night will want strength fortitude for what be to come so clearing brow went into house listened to music joined in talk until ten o'clock struck one got up to go so ended last happy evening at next morning brought news of rising at delhi be not till two day later that letter giving detail of terrible event arrived full extent of awful calamity be known flame broke out at meerut at seven o'clock in evening of sunday th of may on previous day punishment parade have be held to witness military degradation of number of men of third native cavalry who have be guilty of mutinous conduct in respect to cartridge native regiment at station consisted of third cavalry eleventh twentieth infantry there be also in garrison sixtieth rifle sixth dragoon guard two battery of artillery force amply sufficient if properly handled to have crushed native troop to have nipped mutiny in bud unhappily be not well handled cantonment of meerut be of great extent being nearly five mile in length by two in breadth barrack of british troop be situated at distance from of native regiment action of troop be paralyzed by incompetency of general old man who have lost energy who remained in state of indecision while men of native regiment shot officer murdered woman child white inhabitant whose bungalow be situated at end of cantonment opened jail door after setting fire to whole of quarter of meerut marched off toward delhi unmolested by british troop even then orderly sent off with dispatch to officer commanding at delhi informing of what have happened bidding beware might have saved life of hundred of englishman woman even if be too late to save delhi nothing be done english troop made few meaningless uncertain movement marched back to barrack one came forward to take lead so white troop of meerut remained stationary under arm night english population of delhi be left to fate from meerut to delhi be thirty two mile mutineer of meerut marching night arrived near town at eight in morning singularly enough ancient capital of india place around aspiration of hindoo mohammedan alike centered where ex emperor family still resided be left entirely to guard of native troop not single british regiment be there not battery of white troop a center of province large white population be gathered there family of officer of native infantry artillery of civil officer of province merchant banker missionary others a at other indian town great bulk of white inhabitant lived in cantonment outside town have not be for not one must have escaped slaughter commenced a soon a third cavalry from meerut rode into town fifty fourth native infantry who have hastily be marched out to meet fraternized with at once standing quietly by looked on while officer be murdered by cavalryman then commenced scene of murder atrocity be happily without parallel in history suffice to say that with exception of half dozen who in one way other managed to escape whole of white population inside wall of delhi be murdered under circumstance of most horrible revolting cruelty have news of outbreak of meerut be sent by swift mounted whole of hapless people must have have time to leave town before arrival of mutineer in cantonment outside city fared somewhat better be killed greater part made escape although many be murdered on way by villager by body of mutineer majority reached meerut aliwal sufferer of delhi did not die wholly unavenged inside city wall be immense magazine containing vast store of powder cartridge arm be important that must not fall into hand of mutineer be in charge of

neighborhood after gun howitzer have be placed in several position above named be loaded with double charge of grape after arrangement have be completed train be laid ready to be fired at preconcerted signal on enemy approaching wall of magazine be provided with scaling ladder native establishment at once deserted by climbing up sloped shed on inside of magazine descending ladder on outside when attack began mutineer climbed wall in great number opened fire upon little garrison replied by incessant fire of grape shot told severely upon enemy there be two men to gun stood nobly to piece until be more le wounded by enemy fire finding that more must be done lieutenant willoughby gave order conductor scully fired several train in instant tremendous explosion took place shook delhi covered city with cloud of black smoke be calculated that from fifteen hundred to two thousand of mutineer rabble of town be killed by falling wall crushed under mass of masonry lieutenant willoughby forrest rayner conductor buckley survived explosion effected retreat in confusion through small sallyport on river face mutineer be so enraged by misfortune that rushed to palace demanded of king number of european officer lady who have sought refuge under protection be handed over to mutineer at once slaughtered warrener listened with pale face a father on return from orderly room where news have be discussed told sad story there be nothing to be done suppose papa ned said gently boy be in hand of god must wait now for what may come at present regiment professes fidelity have now volunteered to march against mutineer colonel belief so do of others may be that men mean what say at present know that emissary come go fresh rising will be incentive to be use blinking truth dear be like men standing on loaded mine may at moment explode have be thinking indeed for last week have done nothing think what be best to be done if mutiny break out at night at time when be not on parade have agreed that white will make at once for mr thompson house be strongest of of residence for there must of course be getting to messhouse then will sell life a dearly a may if happens when be on parade defense by rest of resident must be useless there be six civilian with two boy for have counted eight probably few of must gain thompson house in time if did number must be too small to defend there remains then nothing flight rising will most likely take place on parade resident have agreed that day will on excuse other have trap at door at hour so that at sound of first shot fired may jump in drive off papa kate asked dear said father will be on duty so long a vestige of regiment remains a regiment will be with if whole regiment break up attack who fall at first volley will be justified in

mounted will a far a possible cover retreat so be arranged will road be open to meerut uncle rose asked after pause for danger seemed so strange terrible that felt stunned by dear certainly will not there be three garrison town between also will probably be up only thing be to keep to road for first ten twelve mile then take to wood make way on foot have spoken to saba morning can trust nursed

then make for copse of tree try find way to meerut trust may be with may join on road in case will relieve anxiety greatly to know that course be laid down if have to return here to look for must bring pursuer after chance of escape must be gone for rely upon to follow instruction to letter yes indeed papa be unanimous answer of young warrener who be deeply affected at solemn manner in father spoke of situation have brace of revolver upstairs said will give one to of boy carry always put on under coat so that may not be noticed must be a well for to practice yourselves in use when do so

square at distance of ten yard during time captain dunlop manner spent whole time when not engaged upon military duty at major warrener be now recognized lover of kate rose although in day of tremendous anxiety peril formal engagement be entered upon young people understood other major warrener gave tacit approval very earnestly party hoped that when dread moment came might come when be together so that might share same fate might be young officer buggy now stood day in major warrener compound with patient syces squatting near talking with servant while major horse stood ready saddled in stable however much party might hope to be together when crisis came felt that be improbable that must be so for at first symptom of mutiny must be duty of officer to hasten to barrack to endeavor to quell even if certain death must meet there in face of tidings from meerut delhi pretense of confidence have hitherto be kept up at station came to end even have there be implicit confidence in regiment news of such terrible event must have caused entire cessation of little amusement gathering in sandynugghur have previously indulged a be usual in case of extreme danger various temperament of people come strongly into relief at awful time pretty young wife of doctor be nearly wild with alarm not daring to remain at home alone passed day in going from house to house of female

save in punjab trouble have come be coming general anson be collecting in haste force at umballah be intended to advance upon delhi where ex king have be proclaimed emperor of india force must necessarily be extremely small one help must possibly arrive up country for many week there be therefore only punjab to look to for aid happily troop of madras bombay presidency have so far remained faithful suppose have good many men from delhi civilian military a well a from other place oh yes be crowded bungalow have be given up to lady sleep under canvas intend to ask leave to get up troop of volunteer major warrener said in first place to go out bring in daughter niece afterward to do scouting other duty may be required there have already be talk of forming unattached officer civilian into sort of irregular cavalry so must think that will get leave will be hazardous business to make way eighty mile through country especially a mutineer be marching in direction toward delhi next morning major warrener obtained permission without difficulty to carry out scheme news sooner be known through cantonment that body of irregular horse be to be formed for scouting general purpose unattached officer might until received further order join than tent have be assigned to major warrener be besieged by men anxious to join corp seemed likely to afford chance of striking early blow at

jacket puggaree there be actual uniform most of men have hunting breech many have high boot others have gaiter be minor point a be horse equipment nothing have be said a to intended expedition to bring in fugitive a native spy might have carried news to rebel so caused renewed search to be made for hiding place there be therefore deep feeling of satisfaction a well a of surprise when on tenth day after formation of corp men be told on being dismissed from morning parade that squadron must parade for duty at evening gunfire that man be to be provided with blanket haversack with cooked food sufficient for four day bag with twenty pound of forage for horse horse to be well fed before coming on parade have route be free from enemy distance might have be done in two long night march must be necessary to make detour on starting so a to avoid striking main road a on way out be important to avoid detection a enemy might muster in such strength that return must be difficult dangerous in extreme girl once in hand return journey must be easy a must avoid infantry have fear of being able to cut way through body of cavalry whom might accidentally come across especially a must have advantage of surprise half hour after sunset squadron rode out from line at meerut amid hearty cheer from many troop at station who hearing that warrener light horse be off on expedition against

from main road have not be visited by of troop a major have ascertained before starting account be not reassuring guide reported that stood on rock rose perpendicularly eighty hundred foot from plain only access being by zigzag road cut in face of cliff with gateway defended by gun loopholed wall at turn with very strong wall round edge of rock garrison have learned from person at farm be three hundred strong ordinary number of retainer being at present increased by many fighting men who have within last few day joined rajah on hearing that be going to march to delhi to fight under emperor against feringhees troop halted in wood three mile from nahdoor a guide said that there be place nearer where must be concealed without certainty of discovery before morning major warrener second in command put on native clothes former bad brought with in case must be necessary to open communication with girl left wood with one of native guide disguise be not meant to deceive close investigation attempt be made to change color of skin be sufficient to enable wearer to pas without exciting suspicion by one who only saw at distance when morning broke stood within mile of fortress answered exactly to description have received of gradually keeping always at distance availing a far a possible of cover made circuit of place then returned to troop who be anxiously awaiting report be very hard nut to crack major warrener said to son there be possibility of climbing rock anywhere of attacking in way except by regular ascent there be eight gateway to be forced before arriving at main entrance through wall must require petard to blow in gate ought to have field gun to drive out of gate house say must be absolutely impossible because before now british troop have done what seemed impossible in india difficulty must be so enormous risk of failure so great loss certainly so crushing must not be justified in undertaking desperate adventure on own responsibility for own private end have right boy to cause loss of thirty forty of fine young fellow even to rescue girl attack by surprise be only possibility at present see way something may turn up to help failing that only plan be to wait till rajah start with following girl for delhi then to attack on way drawback to be that may not leave for day at moment may be discovered besides there be difficulty of feeding horse now

stone at end will be below with strong rope ladder made with picket rope bamboo stave once fixed will be up in time leave to to decide who be best linguist must of course be asked if be willing to undertake will speak to guide what do think of general plan excellent officer said might be a well one suggested that of party must have light rope wound round so that if one two even three must not

meet terrible disaster with more undaunted front than displayed by government british population of india when full extent of peril caused by rising of sepoys be first clearly understood by rising of delhi of whole country down to allahabad northern part of india be entirely cut off from calcutta be left wholly to own resource help must be spared from capital be needed for menaced garrison of allahabad benares agra while be certain that important station of cawnpore lucknow in newly annexed province of oude must at best be scarcely able to defend must in probability urgently require assistance thus rebel city of delhi center focus of insurrection be safe from possibility of british advance from south did look a if position of english be much better in north at sealkote lahore many other station sepoys mutinied sikh regiment be disturbed semi mutinous be at important moment that fidelity of two three of great sikh chieftain saved british india foremost of be rajah of puttiala who when whole sikh nation be wavering a to course must take rode into nearest british station with only one retainer offered whole force whole treasury to british government half dozen other prominent prince instantly followed example from moment northern india be not only safe be able to furnish troop for siege of delhi sikh regiment at once returned to habitual state of cheerful

occasion upon mutineer british troop met sepoys have have entirely own way mutiny havoc murder have gone on unchecked now tide be to turn never to ebb again until sepoy mutiny be drowned in sea of blood upon first meeting with white troop sepoys be confident of success be greatly superior in force have be carefully drilled in english system be led by native regimental officer have be for so many year pampered indulged by government that regarded a being man for man fully equal to british thus then began to fight with confidence of victory however great superiority in number be never again felt by mutineer throughout war upon many subsequent occasion fought with extreme bravery be bravery of despair whereas british soldier be animated with burning desire for vengeance absolute confidence of victory thus fight at ghazee ud deen nugghur be memorable one in annals of british india mutineer seeing smallness of british force at first advanced to attack be met with such fury by four company of sixtieth rifle supported by eight gun of artillery by carbineer warrener horse that astounded dismayed broke before impetuous onslaught abandoned intrenchment threw way arm fled leaving five gun in hand of victor in many case not stopping in flight until reached gate of delhi next day considerable body of fresh troop came out to renew attack report of fugitive of day before of fury desperation with british troop be possessed have already effected impression that did not venture upon close fighting after engaging in artillery duel at long distance fell back again to delhi on th of june meerut force joined that from umballah at alipore short march from delhi next morning little army now under command of sir h barnard for general anson overwhelmed by work responsibility have died few day before advanced upon capital of india after four mile march came at badulee ka serai upon enemy first line of defense strong intrenched position held by three thousand sepoys with twelve gun piece of artillery be much heavier than british field gun a opened heavy fire inflicted considerable damage upon advancing troop british however be in humor for distant fighting panted to get at murderer of woman child men who have shot down in cold blood officer whose only fault have be too great kindness to confidence in order be given to seventy fifth to advance at once take position regiment giving tremendous cheer rushed forward with such impetuosity through heavy fire that a at ghazee ud deen nugghur sepoys be seized with panic fled in wild haste from intrenchment leaving cannon behind at foot of steep hill on signal tower stand stronger line of defense have be prepared mutineer stationed here be infected by wild panic of fugitive from first position so deserting position joined in flight into city british troop have marched from encampment at alipore at one in morning by nine be last sepoy disappeared within wall of town british flag flew out on signal tower on ridge almost looking down upon rebel city troop took up quarter in line formerly occupied by thirty eighth fifty fourth seventy fourth native regiment a english flag blew out to wind from signal tower thrill of anxiety must have be felt by one in delhi from emperor down to lowest street ruffian so long a waved there be proof that british raj be not yet overthrown that british supremacy although sorely shaken still asserted that day of reckoning retribution must slowly perhaps none le surely come for blood stained city not only in delhi over whole of india eye of population be turned toward british flag on ridge native british alike recognized fact that english supremacy in india depended upon maintenance that england must send out large reinforcement knew also knew that many anxious week must elapse before first soldier from england must arrive within striking distance if native leader at delhi with enormously superior force at command must not drive off besieger pluck down flag from ridge time must come when with arrival of reinforcement tide must begin to flow against so india argued waited for result delhi leader a well a english felt importance of issue one never relaxed desperate effort to drive back besieger other with astonishing tenacity held on against odds while score of native chief hesitated on verge waiting until saw end of struggle at delhi be called siege of delhi must rather have be called siege of ridge for be force rather than of enemy be besieged never before in history of world did three thousand men sit down before great city inhabited by quarter of million bitterly hostile inhabitant defended moreover by strong wall very powerful artillery well drilled disciplined force at first amounting to ten thousand men swelled later on a mutineer poured in from quarter to three time force never during long month struggle lasted did attempt to do more than to hold own city be open to enemy at side save where held footing large force marched in out of town provision store poured into can scarcely be said to have fired shot at until battery opened to effect breach few day before final assault troop with sir h barnard arrived before delhi consisted of seventy fifth regiment six company of sixtieth rifle first bengal fusilier six company of second fusilier composed of white troop sirmoor battalion of goorkhas sixth dragoon guard carbineer two squadron of ninth lancer troop two of newly raised irregular horse artillery consisted of thirty piece mostly light field gun upon day following occupation of ridge welcome accession of strength be received by arrival of guide picked corp consisting of three troop of cavalry six company of infantry little force have marched five hundred eighty mile in twenty two day rate of twenty six mile day without break feat probably altogether without example especially when be considered that took place in india in hottest time of year ridge occupies so important place in history of siege of delhi be sharp backed hill mile long rising abruptly from plain from top splendid view of delhi of country scattered with mosque tomb remains of older delhi can be obtained cantonment lay at back of hill few post only such a hindoo rao house being held in advance until work of building battery regularly commencing siege must begin must have be useless putting troop unnecessarily under fire of heavy gun of city bastion when troop have fairly taken possession of old native line on th of june many of a soon a dismissed from duty made way up to flagstaff tower on highest point of ridge to look down upon delhi among who did so be major warrener two son uttered exclamation of pleasure a city came into view what superb city delhi be indeed glorious city a viewed from ridge be surrounded by lofty crenelated wall strengthened with detached martello tower with eleven bastion mounting nine gun work of own engineer in admirable architectural keeping with tower conspicuous on high table rock rising almost perpendicularly in heart of city be jumma musjid great mosque superb pile of building with dome minaret to left a viewed from ridge be great mass of king

passed with music playing flag flying into town glorious city ned warrener said a looked down upon what ridiculous handful of men seem by side of be like tom thumb sitting down to besiege giant castle why must be lost if got inside yes indeed ned said father there will be possibility of storming city until number be greatly increased for if scaled wall by assault must no doubt do must have to fight way through narrow street with barrier barricade everywhere such force a ours must simply melt away before fire from housetop window there be nothing so terrible a street fighting drill discipline be there of comparatively little use enemy will naturally fight with desperation of rat in hole must be rash in extreme for to make attempt until be sure of success disastrous repulse here must entail loss of india news be worse worse day from station of northwest a mutineer be sure to make for delhi enemy will receive reinforcement vastly more rapidly than will will be will be able to do to hold own here may be month before take delhi hope wo keep here time dick said for cavalry ca do much in siege besides ground be cut up into garden inclosure must not act even if have order to do so may be very useful in going out to bring convoy in major warrener replied to cut off convoy of enemy to scout generally to bring in news still agree with dick that hope may be sent off for duty elsewhere hullo what be a spoke sudden fire broke out from wall bastion shot shell whizzed over head many of plunging down behind ridge among troop who be engaged in getting up tent while crackling fire of musketry broke out in garden around hindoo rao house advanced post on right front sortie exclaimed major come along boy who have gathered around flagstaff dashed down hill to join respective corp sixtieth rifle however of whom two company held hindoo rao repulsed sortie calmed down again enemy artillery continued to play be evident that foe have in power to cause great annoyance to picket on ridge fortunately position must only be assailed on one side cavalry patrolled plain a far a river rear be covered by canal possessing few bridge easily guarded be thus from right right front alone serious attack must be looked for next afternoon heavy firing broke out near hindoo rao house troop got under arm enemy be evidently in force aid de camp rode up major warrener will move up troop fall in with guide cavalry at trot warrener horse moved off toward right gun on wall be now at work artillery at hindoo rao be answering shot from light battery placed by flagstaff went singing away toward

force fury fresh body of mutineer who came into city being required to testify loyalty to emperor by heading attack on foe desperately little british force have to fight to maintain position loss be so serious number of enemy so large so rapidly increasing that be clear to that most prodigious effort must be necessary to enable to hold on until reinforcement arrived that idea of early capture of city must be abandoned warrener horse however have share in struggle for on day after fight at flagstaff report spread among that be again to start upon expedition note have be brought in by native to

being collected at allahabad to march to relief finally very reluctantly latter course be decided upon be agreed truth of conclusion be proved by fact that throughout mutiny there be single instance of rebel however numerous carrying position held by body of englishman sir hugh wheeler force must probably hold intrenchment against assault that enemy must make that if forced to surrender must probably be from want of supply in case arrival of hundred men must be source of weakness rather than of strength reinforcement must not be of sufficient strength to enable garrison incumbered a be with woman child to cut way out while there must be hundred more mouth to fill be therefore resolved to change course to avoid cawnpore to make direct for allahabad with news of urgent strait in sir

state of thing in garrison be necessarily vague untrustworthy most satisfactory portion of boy statement be that although garrison be now on short ration that comfort many of what be regarded a almost necessary of life be exhausted yet that there be plenty of grain in place to enable besieged to exist for week longer great fear be that essential part of defense may be destroyed by mine ned concluded against open attack think that garrison be safe enemy be now devoting so much to driving mine however great care vigilance of garrison may not be always able to detect even if do so to run

properly placed alert when returned door be shut to keep out damp air whole party rolling in cloak using saddle for pillow laid up for night dick be time before slept imagination be active when at last dozed off be thinking what have best do be attacked by enemy be still dark when with sudden start sleeping party in tomb awoke leaped to foot for moment stood bewildered for outside be heard on side crack of volley of musketry wild yell shout trampling of large body of cavalry surprised exclaimed colonel sentry must have be asleep there be rush to door sight met eye showed extent of disaster moon be shining brightly by light must see that large body of rebel cavalry have fallen upon sleeping trooper while heavy musketry fire showed that strong body of infantry be at work on other side of mosque lieutenant latham rushed down step with sword drawn fell back dead shot through heart back back shouted colonel warrener let sell life here chapter xxiii desperate defense in instant door be closed bolted four set to work to pile barrel box against not word be spoken while be going on by time have finished uproar without have changed character firing have ceased triumphant shout of mutineer showed that victory be complete then came loud thundering noise at door have only delayed few minute colonel warrener said have fought fight boy time have come must to god have to die alone look father dick said there be small door there noticed last night doubt there be staircase leading to terrace above at rate may make good fight there yes major dunlop said may fight out to last on stair run dick see dick found a supposed that from door narrow winding staircase led to terrace above from dome rose far into air stair be lit by occasional narrow window be thinking a ran upstairs of idea have crossed brain night before be all right said a came down again look father if take up barrel box can make barricade on stair defend for time almost excellent colonel said to work will be quarter of hour breaking in door make top barricade first few foot below terrace seized box barrel hurried up stair have longer time for preparation than expected for mutineer feeling sure of prey be in hurry finding how strong be door decided to sit down wait until gun must be up to blow in thus defender of tomb have hour grace in time have constructed three solid barricade be placed short distance above opening for light so that while be in darkness assailant must be in light left sufficient space at top of barricade for to scramble over leaving spare barrel on stair above to fill up space after taking position now for remains of supper father dick said big water jug will carry up ned do bring up long coil of thin rope what for dick may be useful ned rope be always useful ah gun be up a spoke round shot crashed through door sent splinter of cask cloud of flour flying now ned come along dick said followed by colonel warrener major dunlop entered little doorway ran up narrow stair at first barricade be thirty step up officer stopped proceeded to fill up passage hitherto left open while boy continued way to terrace let have look round ned fellow will be minute before be in yet that barricade will puzzle day be breaking now lad peered over parapet ran round terrace there be tremendous lot of fellow dick four five thousand of at least have got six gun hurrah ned dick said looking round at great dome be just what hoped pointed to flight of narrow step only twelve inch across fixed to side of dome rose for distance almost perpendicularly by side of step be low hand rail be evidently placed there permanently to enable workman to ascend to top of dome to re gild long spike surmounted by crescent rose from summit to do repair be needful there ned noticed step on of dome at lucknow when worst come to worst be beaten from stair can climb up ladder for be more like ladder than stair once on top must laugh at whole army of now ned let go down to by cheering below artillery have broken door open mutineer burst through broken door into great hall with triumphant yell heralding entrance by storm of musketry fire for knew how desperately even few englishman will sell life there be shout of disappointment at finding interior untenanted moment glance round discovered door there be rush toward longing to be first to slaughter light in interior be faint stair be pitch dark be only wide enough for one man to go up with comfort although two must just stand side by side without obstacle leader of party stumbled groped way up stair until first came into light of long narrow loophole in wall then from darkness above came sharp crack of revolver man fell on face shot through heart crack next shared fate then there be pause for spiral be so sharp that not more than two at time be within sight of defender of barricade next man hesitated at seeing immediate leader fall pressed from behind advanced with musket at shoulder in readiness to fire when saw foe instant head appeared round corner ball struck too fell still press from behind pushed leader forward be not until six have fallen narrow stair be impassable from dead body that officer of rank who came next on line succeeded by shouting in checking advance then order be passed down for crowding doorway to fall back officer with men on stair descended former reported to leader six men have fallen that stair be choked with body after much consultation order be given men to go up keeping below spot at one after comrade have fallen to stretch out arm pull down body be done then angry consultation again took place be clear that moving fast only one must mount stair at time seemed equally certain that one must on reaching certain spot be shot by invisible foe large reward great honor be promised by chief to who must undertake to lead assault at last volunteer be found rush attempted failed a have first man a passed loophole fell again dead choked stair one two have not fallen at first shot have got few step higher only to fall back dead upon comrade again assault ceased for two three hour there be pause officer of mutineer deliberated quarreled men set to to prepare meal that over one of trooper went in to officer proposed plan be at once approved of handsome reward immediately paid before enlisting have be carpenter a there be many others of same trade time be lost in carrying out suggestion several of thick plank composing door remained uninjured be cut nailed together so a to make shield of exactly same width a staircase six foot high on one side several strap loop be nailed to give good hold to carrying then with cheer sepoys again prepared for attack shield be heavy steadily with much labor be carried up stair step by step by two men others pressing on behind when reached loophole pistol shot from above again rang out door be of heavy seasoned wood three inch thick bullet failed to penetrate then shield ascended step by step until reached barrier there stopped for strength must be brought to bear upon be altogether insufficient to move in slightest solid pile after time spent in vain effort shield be taken back again a gradually carefully a have be advanced until out of range of pistol of defender what will be next move wonder colonel warrener said a little party sat down on stair waited for renewal of attack like shield major dunlop remarked show that there be more than usually intelligent scoundrel among will be up to new trick hour passed then there be noise on stair shield be again seen approaching a before advanced to barrier stopped there be then sort of grating noise against door shook a continued what on earth be up to now major dunlop exclaimed piling fagot against dick said be mistaken have be afraid of fire along if have only lit pile of damp wood at bottom of stair must have smoked out at top then a smoke cleared below must have gone up removed barricade before upper stair be free enough from smoke for to come down there thought so make haste dick dashed up stair followed by friend a curl of smoke ascended loud cheer burst from sepoys below quickly a ran upstairs smoke ascended still more rapidly emerged upon terrace half suffocated blinded so end barricade number one major dunlop said when have recovered from fit of coughing suppose will be pretty nearly hour before fire be burned out door must not burn through in time said major warrener will be able to stand pretty close moment fagot be burned out will drag screen out of way with long pole with hook something of sort haul down barricade directly smoke clear off enough for to breathe will go down to middle barricade may take that same way took first can not take last so why not father ned asked because be only ten step from top ned so that however great smoke make can be there again instant begin to pull down be now past midday party partook sparingly of small store of food water smoke continued for time to pour out of door of stair in dense volume then became lighter several time lad tried to descend few step found that breathing be impossible for smoke from green wood be insupportable at last became clear enough to breathe then party ran rapidly down to second barricade at least be intact below must hear fall of heavy body knew that lower barricade be destroyed suppose that screen of theirs be burned through father so very likely will try same dodge again of course know whether have barricade where be so will come on cautiously seems to than if dunlop be to take place bit lower than stooping down on stair then when come be boldly to throw yourselves with weight suddenly against shield must send bearer headlong downstairs must then follow cut up tremendously capital dick must be just thing think so dunlop if have got shield can shoot down so either way may a well make sortie think so major dunlop said here go then halfway down heard trampling of step again sepoys have extinguished fire with bucket of water have put strap to door again be pursuing former tactic two officer sat down awaited coming of foe slowly latter ascended until door be within two step of englishman then latter simultaneously flung weight against wholly unprepared for assault bearer be hurled backward with heavy shield upon knocking down behind who in turn fell on below sword in hand colonel warrener sprang upon hindmost of falling mass while pressing just behind firing over shoulder major dunlop followed shriek of dismay rose from sepoys who crowded stair a body of above be hurled upon flight defense be equally impossible turning to descend leaped upon comrade below frightful scene ensued scene a have sometimes be seen on stair of theater on fire what be danger above none thought wild panic seized over other rolled choking stair obstructing movement until last twenty foot of stair be packed closely with solid mass of human being lying thickly on other stifling other to death on reaching mass colonel warrener friend paused there be nothing more to be done over fifty human being lay crushed together on top of heap be shot then officer retraced step many lay on stair major dunlop have passed sword through body a passed four musket be picked up ammunition from pouch then with boy who have followed closely behind again ascended to terrace sat down be safe now for time colonel warrener said will take long time to clear away heap of dead wo try shield dodge again be indeed late in afternoon before sepoys made fresh move against defender of stair time however have not passed idly with latter one of keeping watch at barrier others have maintained steady musketry fire through open work of parapet upon enemy below sepoys have answered with scattering fire a defender be invisible behind parapet must move from one point to unobserved there be little fear of being hit while steady fire did so much execution among throng of sepoys that have to move camping ground couple of hundred yard back from tomb be nearly dark when several men bearing large bundle of straw bamboo ran across open ground entered mosque besieged guessed that attempt be to be made to smoke out there have be much consultation on part of enraged mutineer time two men with musket leveled at shoulder led advance very slowly made way up until pistol shot rang out one of leader discharging musket before fell then there be halt sepoy with fixed bayonet took place in front over shoulder of comrade behind threw bundle of straw mixed with wet leaf light be applied to with sheet of flame between besieged have fear now pressed forward threw on fresh straw then knowing that besieged must have fled higher reached through flame with pole with hook attached to hauled down barricade moment fire burned little low two men lighted fresh bundle stamping out fire advanced up stair carrying before blazing bundle like torch volume of smoke from of course preceding party on terrace have noticed smoke dying down have prepared to descend again when fresh addition to smoke convinced that enemy be still piling on bundle that there be nothing to fear so sat quietly chatting until ned who be sitting next to door exclaimed listen be pulling down top barricade sword in hand rushed down others closely following just a turned spiral must bring in sight of upper barricade musket be fired ned must have fallen forward have not major dunlop seized by collar pulled backward hold stair colonel said be at barricade be not through yet will carry ned up be hit in shoulder major dunlop carried ned to platform laying down for have lost consciousness rushed back to assist to hold stair for crack of colonel warrener dick revolver must be heard advantage however be so great with standing above others so placed a to be able to fire instant that foe came round corner that sepoys after losing several of number ceased attack defender hurried up to ned confident that enemy must not renew assault again for moment a must not tell whether there be yet barrier to be stormed dick stood sentry at door colonel major dunlop examined ned wound be serious one ball have entered chest below collarbone have be fired from level must have be fatal sepoy having stood so much below have gone out near neck smashing collar bone on way ned have become unconscious from shock to system must take to dome at once colonel warrener said next assault fellow will gain terrace will carry ned up colonel will take major dunlop said can carry over shoulder a easily a possible well dunlop be younger man so will hand over to will put coil of rope round neck will take water food be so dark now that will not see from below if fellow have waited hour must have gained top without sad business will go first dunlop major dunlop who be very powerful active man lifted ned on shoulder began to ascend narrow step to dome be hard work at first a got on ascent became le steep last part be comparatively easy colonel warrener mounted next also heavily laden dick remained on guard at door until saw father pas shoulder of dome out of sight from on terrace then slung two musket cartridge pouch on shoulder briskly climbed step be soon by father in three minute party be gathered round central spike of dome suddenly loud cheer be heard from below be out on terrace dick said will go down bit to guard step will be more use with ned than must shout on terrace be answered by great cheer of exultation from sepoy host around who have be chafed almost to madness at immense loss be being caused by three four men for knew not exact strength of party shout of exultation however be silenced when rushing round terrace sepoys found that foe have again evaded there be other door hiding place nowhere in fact that besieged must have concealed ladder like step soon met eye of searcher yell of anger disappointment arose not even bravest among thought for moment of climbing stair for must indeed have be clearly impossible for men forced to climb in single file to win way against well armed defender who must simply shoot down from above a fast a head appeared over shoulder of dome position be indeed practically impregnable against assault although exposed to artillery fire to distant musketry be for reason that defender of stair have not taken to at once felt confident in ability to defend stair day to inflict heavy loss upon enemy whereas by climbing up dome in daylight must have be target to below while climbing must have be exposed day to distant fire that must have to support for two three day be nearly certain clearly le time better enemy consoling with thought on morrow cannon must finish contest have thus far cost so dearly placed guard of fifty men on terrace at foot of step lighted large fire there in order that must see one attempting to descend long before reached level then retired below by time ned have recovered consciousness having taken drink of water be able to understand what have happened father have cut uniform off shoulder arm having also cut off one of own shirt sleeve have soaked in water applied a bandage on wound be very glad have agreed that only dick must go ned said otherwise must have blamed for keeping here must not have gone in case colonel warrener said a there must have be one to have lowered rope here besides be only sailor practiced gymnast who can let down rope eighty foot when will dick try a soon a camp get quiet moon will be up by twelve o'clock must be off before be in much pain old boy not much father feel numbed stupid now dunlop colonel warrener said will relieve dick on guard at step may a well say good by to be about eight o'clock now in couple of hour will be off after have gone will relieve then four hour watch will take to daylight there wo be much sleeping after by ten o'clock noise in rebel camp have nearly ceased group still sat talked round campfire circle be pretty large round tomb for sepoys have fallen back when musketry fire be opened upon from parapet have not troubled to move again afterward now dick said be time for to be off have got good seventy mile to ride to lucknow be use thinking of going after column for must be fifty mile away from place where left by to morrow night if can get good horse may be at lucknow by midday to morrow horse have have rest to day sir colin will be sure send off at once troop will march well to effect rescue will make thirty five mile before halt for night will be here by following night must not be too sanguine dick be just possible dear boy that if go well may be back a say in forty eight hour will make up mind to twice time if get here sooner better expect that will hit after tiring bit chance be will not care to waste ammunition will try to starve out chapter xxiv best after labor with tender farewell of father brother midshipman prepared for expedition one end of rope have be fastened round large mast rose from dome holding coil over shoulder dick made way down dome on side opposite at have ascended until became too steep to walk then lay down on back paying rope out gradually let slip down lower part of descent be almost perpendicular dick soon stood safely on terrace be a expected confidently that must be quite deserted on side then let go of rope major warrener who be watching saw that strain be off pulled up foot to make sure then untied knot dick pulled gently at first coiling up a came down until at last slid rapidly down caught a well a must have little fear of so slight noise being heard on other side of great dome then tied rope to parapet lowered carefully down then when be out swung out over parapet slid down rope height be over eighty foot descent be mere nothing for dick accustomed to lark about in rigging of man o ' war stood perfectly quiet for minute two after foot touched ground outside everything be still through open carved stonework of window must hear voice inside tomb have doubt that leader of enemy force be there from parapet in afternoon have gained accurate idea of position of cavalry toward at once made way took off boot walked lightly until approached enemy bivouac then went cautiously ground be covered with sleeping figure wrapped like mummy in clothes although night be dusk be easy in starlight to see white figure even have one be awake dick have little fear a except near fire figure must have be indistinguishable there be difficulty when neared spot in finding horse a sound of pawing ground eating occasional short neigh of two quarreling be clearly distinguishable position once clear dick moved round have noticed that four officer horse be picketed further away beyond general mass of men must therefore be more easily removed must moreover be more likely to be fast sound have too advantage of being placed close to road by english force have marched on day before dick be time in finding horse be on lookout for at last heard snorting at short distance off on reaching spot found horse be in search of be saddled none have bridle must be dick knew useless to look for felt sure that halter must be sufficient for well trained horse before proceeding to work reconnoitered ground around found way to road be twenty yard distant discovered also that syces groom be asleep close by horse little further off be party of sleeping trooper dick now cut off heel rope by two of horse be picketed then leading by halter moved quietly toward road to get upon however there be ditch first to be passed in crossing one of horse stumbled what be exclaimed one of syces sitting up halloo continued leaping up two of horse have got loose others leaped to foot ran in direction whence came noise have awakened thinking that horse have drawn picket peg by time dick be in saddle giving kick with heel to horse be on striking other with halter held in hand dashed off into gallop shout burst from syces several of trooper springing to foot seizing arm ran up to know what be matter thief have stolen colonel horse exclaimed one of syces trooper did not like to fire a must have alarmed camp besides random fire in darkness must be of avail so grumbling that syces must have to answer for in morning went off to sleep again while men in charge of two horse have be taken after consultation decided that must be unsafe to remain to meet anger of officer in morning so stole off in darkness made for native village dick hearing that be not pursued pulled up in half mile gave loud shrill cooey australian call knew that must be heard by father sitting listening at top of dome that must learn that so far have succeeded then set horse off again in hand gallop rode steadily down road hour so changed from horse to horse thus giving comparative rest by turn occasionally allowed to walk for bit to get wind then again rode on at gallop be about eleven o'clock when started on ride by four in morning be at spot where party have separated from column having thus made forty mile after that went more slowly be little past nine when with two exhausted horse rode into camp at lucknow where appearance created excitement dick story be briefly told two horse be splendid animal be taken off to be fed rubbed down while dick accompanied by colonel of cavalry regiment where have halted went at once to camp of commander in chief sir colin

be starting shook hand with dick expressed warm hope that must find friend safe at end of journey then cavalry started dick have always asserted that never in life did make such short journey a worn out by excitement fatigue of preceding thirty hour fell fast asleep in ambulance before have gone mile did not awake until surgeon shook by shoulder halloo cried leaping up where be be a far a can tell about mile from tomb must not wake when halted warrener thought wanted sleep more than food have be halting hour here cavalry have just come up be about hour before daybreak colonel want to act a guide all right dick said leaping out just to think have be asleep for eighteen hour hasty council be held be determined that a country be somewhat wooded beyond tomb perfectly open on side cavalry artillery must remain where be that infantry must make detour attack at daybreak from other side that a enemy fell back artillery cavalry must deal with not moment be lost infantry who be sitting down after long tramp got cheerily on to foot again for knew that be going to attack enemy dick led off road by considerable detour to come upon enemy from other side by moonlight tomb be visible served a center round to march be too far off to enable dick to see whether damage have be done to dome day be just breaking when infantry gained desired position then throwing out two hundred men in skirmishing order while other one hundred be kept in hand a reserve advance began be not until be within three hundred yard of enemy that be perceived by sentry challenge be answered by musket shot a rebel sprang to foot heavy fire be poured in upon in instant be wild confusion taken completely by surprise entirely ignorant of strength of enemy native after wild fire in direction of advancing foe fled precipitately officer tried to rally a smallness of force attacking became visible sepoys with old habit of discipline began to draw together at moment gun loaded with grape poured into rear with cheer punjaub cavalry burst into midst thenceforth there be longer idea of fighting be simply rout pursuit rebel own gun fell at once into hand of infantry be quickly turned upon mass of fugitive who mown down by fire of nine gun cut up by cavalry who charged hither thither among while volley of musketry swept through threw away arm fled wildly over thousand of be left dead on plain have not horse

disregarding else party with leveled bayonet have burst through throng made straight for door of tomb many of enemy troop have run in there for minute two there be fierce fight in great hall then when last foe have fallen dick led men to stair up many of enemy have fled quick shouted follow close up of be few step ahead dick closely followed by men burst on to terrace at very heel be well that did so for guard upon terrace seeing that be lost below be preparing to sell life dearly to make long resistance at top of stair dick men however rushed so closely upon heel of own comrade from below be taken completely by surprise turned at once to fly others made effort to oppose enemy be useless two three of sepoy leader calling to men to follow made rush at british dick found engaged in hand to hand contest with aboo raab rebel leader be powerful desperate man with swinging blow beat down dick guard inflicted severe wound on head dick leaped forward ran through body just a bayonet of one of
