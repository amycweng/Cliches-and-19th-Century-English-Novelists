commissioned officer manage not to get drunk till be off duty be not fit to be officer must have said so at once if have asked will miss badly will probably see day mean to make exchange into company if can manage will speak to captain buller about have doubt will be willing enough to exchange however whether not can always be friend may be sure of sir be now lunch time arthur went into mess room where received hearty congratulation soon settled down in place that evening wrote long letter to aunt telling of promotion think concluded that will not be long before move have fairly large body of troop here now spanish a well a ourselves why have not moved before be more than can make out suppose big wig know when do begin hope will go on in earnest for delay be very trying hospital here be full of sick nothing must do so much good a to have sharp brush with enemy most of officer found life at vittoria terribly dull to arthur time passed pleasantly enough spent two three hour day working hard at spanish went morning to teacher of fencing reasoning that a sword be now weapon ought to be able to use of officer be inclined to laugh at time expended on study exercise retorted that be good deal more pleasant than sitting in cafe trying to kill time indeed there be plenty to do hardship suffered by troop be extreme pay be forthcoming amount of ration served out be barely sufficient to keep life together quarter assigned to be bitterly cold suffered terribly throughout winter hundred died thousand be so reduced by illness that have to be sent down to seaport where very many more died large number be invalided home comparatively small portion ever took place again in rank of legion officer did must to mitigate suffering of men too received pay except in matter of quarter be a badly off a others of who be men of fortune be able to get little comfort for sick rest must only show sympathy by visiting talking cheeringly to indeed disgust fury of men be so great that have received order to do so must joyfully have set out on march south cut way through carlists christinos alike made at least effort to overthrow government have broken engagement to left to die like dog what still more enraged be that while time be left to starve magazine of spanish troop be full men well fed clothed with spring there be slight improvement in matter remonstrance of british general british government have have slight effect small amount of pay be issued ration be served out with little more regularity there be joy in heart when became known that long period of inactivity have come to end that move be about to be made a long a formed part of force commanded by spanish general cordova felt that nothing must be done carlists occupied hill round vittoria at time sent party almost up to town nothing must arouse cordova from lethargy induce to make serious effort to dislodge enemy be be reported going to co operate with general evans by attacking rear of carlists while legion be to attempt to drive back from strong position occupied outside san sebastian officer men scoffed at idea that cordova must move out of vittoria general opinion be that legion must do better if relied upon own fighting power rather than upon spanish co operation by time mob of men who composed legion have be by incessant drill converted into soldier who only wanted baptism of fire to take place side by side with veteran in point of appearance be not much to look at clothes in for nearly six month have lived slept be almost in rag bearing be erect suffering have set stern expression on face general evans a marched out from vittoria felt that must be thoroughly relied on many who have just recovered from sickness be still thin feeble really unfit for work who must possibly accompany force have obtained release from hospital be envy of many hundred of comrade who be incapable of moving of whom greater part be destined never to leave vittoria a carlists lay between vittoria san sebastian force be compelled to march down to santander men enjoyed change fresh warm breeze of spring reanimated many be true be forced to lag behind most of afterwards rejoined though be murdered by peasantry who be to man hostile strong rear guard however moved slowly behind column collecting who have fallen by way only arriving at santander twenty four hour after rest a soon a head of column reached santander be taken on board ship there be only sufficient transport to carry legion distance be short in four day force be assembled at san sebastian felt that change from vittoria be pleasant one san sebastian stand at extremity of low sandy tongue of land washed on east by urumea on north west by bay of biscay attached to mainland only on south by narrow isthmus be strong by nature art being defended by wall bastion almost free from possibility of attack on sea river face by fact that except at low tide there be scarce room for troop to be landed near foot of wall town have be almost destroyed by being fired by french in memorable siege of when cost british nearly fifteen thousand men in killed wounded to capture fire have be great advantage to for narrow street alley have be swept away replaced by broad street well built house inhabitant here be divided in sympathy mercantile class being with christinos height beyond end of low peninsula be occupied by carlists in great force motive in thus wasting strength when might have be better employed in field be not very clear to arthur brother officer be certain that must not carry place by assault a sea be open to defender be equally impossible for to reduce by hunger place showed few sign of being beleaguered town be full a contained many refugee family from surrounding country shop be well filled with good in evening promenade be thronged with well dressed people who paraded up down to strain of military music cafe be crowded everywhere there be appearance of life animation people viewed with astonishment ragged appearance of regiment a landed many small kindness be shown to effect of sea air bright sun did much for troop in week after arrival have so far smartened up that made decent show officer fraternized with of ship of war although number be sadly thinned since arrival in spain legion have recovered much of jauntiness self confidence be glorious change arthur said to one of comrade a leant on battlement looked out over sea good many ship be in port of transport others laden with store sound of music in town came to ear one begin to feel that after one did not make great mistake in entering legion not have ever greatly repented step have be most fortunate in getting promotion have come to speak spanish decently have certainly learnt how to fence see that last part be likely to be of much use hallett when one doe get into hand to hand fight expect one have much time to think of nicety of fencing one just hit out a one can yes if one be not thorough good fencer if one be not find more natural to strike downright blow than to thrust besides know have learnt fencing so much in order to defend a because be fine exercise in strengthens one muscle amazingly at vittoria enabled one two three hour day to forget misery be being suffered by men last may say not least of advantage be that will enable one to fight be not thinking of fighting battle of duel observed from first great many of spanish officer seem to treat in very cavalier sort of manner be thing feel at inclined to put up with believe most spanish gentleman learn to fence a matter of course know whether be so so have be told be determined to be able to give one of lesson if attempted impertinence towards master at vittoria said before came away that have become very strong fencer a strong indeed a pupil have ever have that be quite astonishing must have learned so much in course of four five month have already engaged master here mean to stick to till feel can hold own with anyone if can do in skill must say that must certainly do in strength hallett look a if be made of whip cord have got good pair of shoulder amount of activity have broadened out amazingly since first saw must certainly say that must be awkward customer to of don who be for most part in spite of swagger undersized lot yes have certainly not much to boast of in way of strength with few exception must not mind taking on two of with one arm tied behind wish have given up three hour day time be at vittoria working at language hallett see that have gained lot by be able to chat away with spanish officer chaff with spanish girl while most of be better than dummy of course have picked up few phrase complimentary for most part quite reverse a medium in conversation with native go far in polite society though do assist bit when want to sharpen up of mule driver men with waggon why begin to learn fencing will occupy time anyhow though say that must find a useful a spanish will think of hallett a soon a fight have come off say will attack enemy line before long will not have time to learn much before may a well take easily till then a may not come out of alive be looking at enemy yesterday from other side of town seem amazingly strong can see by glass that have covered whole face of hill with entrenchment loopholed house think carlists be obstinate fellow will fight hard well do hope that evans will attack a soon a whole legion come up without waiting for cordova be hopeless brute have not least expectation of setting troop in motion to help be wholly with friend said a far a have seen hitherto be evident that if there be fighting to be done will have to do christino commander seem to have only one idea be to avoid engagement have heard that zumalacarreguy have be marching about capturing town collecting spoil playing old gooseberry wherever have gone dodging successfully effort christinos have made to bring to fight be just same thing round vittoria that brute cordova stop there in big house that have taken possession of eats drink enjoys a for marching out to fight carlists idea seems never to have occurred to well be time be turning back for be hour for promenade must say that like looking at senora even if be beyond power to talk to chapter iii adventure arthur found knowledge of spanish very useful to at san sebastian soon made acquaintance of many of young men of town be invited by to feast dance at house where became general favourite by frankness enjoyment with entered into amusement although must converse very fairly on ordinary subject have not a yet learned language of compliment blunt phrase greatly amused spanish girl be indeed far more awkward with than with brother husband except with own cousin who be good deal younger than whom have never thought of complimenting in smallest degree have never known anything of other sex have usual boyish contempt for girl have almost regarded a inferior animal consequently be quite at sea with laughing black eyed senorettas with fluttering fan pretty gesture black mantilla senor inglese one of said with smile do know that be very rude man be shocked to hear said how be rude admire ca go about telling so wish to be admired senor there must be satisfaction if admired one do expect pretty speech nicely delicately put speech without meaning much must imply that be wholly at service be afraid senoretta that will be long time before spanish enables to do sort of thing if came to question of putting arm round waist giving kiss must manage to pay sort of compliment be quite beyond must not do at for to behave so rudely a senor girl laughed must be quite unknown thing be respectful homage that require such homage can be rendered by eye alone without being necessary to speak arthur laughed eye have never be trained to sort of expression senoretta must no more know how to do than how to fly when be boy kissed girl under mistletoe be only sort of romp go for nothing think have ever paid girl compliment in life what do mean by mistletoe senor have never heard of such thing arthur explained a well a must mystery of vegetable what exclaimed kiss girl in sight of other people be dreadful be barbarism spanish girl must suffer thing fancy must if be spanish custom laughed own must never see much fun in still be one of thing that be expected to do at christmas however can assure have idea of introducing custom here will promise that if do kiss will not be in public must never think of thing girl said horrified must be terrible girl permit man to kiss unless be affianced then only very very occasionally will take note of senoretta will wait till be affianced before begin will be english girl spaniard english girl arthur said bluntly say that spanish girl be not very nice way be not way be not of religion friend must disapprove in fact there be sort of objection think prettier than be girl said with toss of head senoretta say have seen many spanish girl quite a pretty a english girl be different kind of beauty one that be not accustomed to more than be accustomed to appearance way of englishman two race be like oil water may stir about a much a like never really mix suppose be so said more seriously than have spoken before say that englishman make good husband that be not jealous a spanish men be of must be very nice still of course there be drawback to well senor must talk over time for here be cavalier coming to claim for next dance arthur be chatting with young spanish officer whose acquaintance have made when latter said wish must go up hill to morrow have uncle living up there be carlist have pretty daughter who be to be married to carlist officer to morrow evening must give good deal to be able to be there see how be to be managed might get there easily enough for must borrow small boat row up urumea after dusk land beyond outpost make way round there of course must be known when got there be sure uncle must be very glad to see must be recognized at once by of friend might disguise arthur said put on big pair of false moustachio of course dress a civilian dare say might be done young officer said if have somebody to go with must be great lark arthur said suppose there must be much danger in even if be detected must hardly make row at wedding no suppose must be hurt feeling between two party be very strong a know quarter be very seldom given on side yes method of war can hardly be called civilized senor a stood looking at hill arthur turned matter over in mind knew that general be very anxious to obtain knowledge of carlist trench fortification if be to volunteer to accompany officer might be able to obtain good deal of information on subject to do so must be obliged after wedding to make way straight down hill instead of coming back to boat thought must not be so very difficult while anyone coming up hill must be closely questioned be hardly likely that so much care must be taken in case of walking down for carlists must be constantly going up down to get provision from village there must be difficulty in getting down to trench at foot of hill from there one must have to run gauntlet still chance of being shot in dark must not be great information that might obtain must be invaluable after thinking over for minute two said to companion have never seen spanish wedding senor must certainly like to do so if must take with must be very glad to accompany must young fellow said well know must be dangerous business if be suspected have doubt that uncle must protect be colonel in service if worst be to happen must be made prisoner if be to find out fear that must show mercy that even uncle must not be able to save think must find out arthur said can talk well enough to pas muster if did not enter into long conversation must take care not to do must of course keep very much in background a must do suppose at wedding like must not good many officer others attend who be not intimate friend of family oh yes uncle house will be virtually open to comer must speak to anyone cousin who be great friend of mine must manage to get close enough to to whisper in ear who be give good wish think risk can be very great if be quite in earnest must be glad of company mind if there be row will have to take care of yourself will look after certainly understand must go in with do a do must keep in background go quietly off at end of evening if by chance be discovered must simply make bolt for night be dark a be pretty good runner think risk of being overtaken must be great will arrange about boat if will tell where will be lying will meet there to morrow evening at time like to name will be quite dark by seven will start at hour can row own can not yes can row arthur said now what disguise must advise to take certainly best disguise must be that of carlist officer know how will be possible to get there have be fighting between men ours good many have be killed on side dead be generally stripped by ruffian of town have doubt that in of shop in poorer quarter carlist uniform may be found of course be not likely to be exhibited for sale now shopkeeper will be reserving till carlists come in be sure to do sooner later soldier servant be smart fellow will send down afternoon to forage about have doubt that will succeed in getting one of medium size for tall man if come down to quarter evening will see what have got if be not large enough for have doubt can easily be altered to fit properly be capital idea arthur said must suit admirably then will come down a say evening see how man have succeeded will be rare adventure young spaniard said told cousin month ago must dance at wedding a thing be growing black then laughed in face laid wager must will be great fun letting know have won when arthur went to spanish officer quarter that evening found examining two uniform laid out on table man have just brought in said one of will fit well enough be afraid that other will never meet across chest coat be little short for be not very noticeable met round waist be three inch too small round chest can get altered easily enough do think can borrow sword from one of comrade can make excuse that yours have gone to be repaired a blade have come out of hilt see pommel of sword be so different from yours that if be to carry mine must lead to detection at once yes doubt can borrow one will get belt from on other excuse will take uniform now will bring sword belt down to river yes have arranged for boat will be at san nicola step at seven in evening fortunately tide will be running in at hour so that will be able to drift past carlist outpost of course will be running out again by time come back capital arthur said everything seems to be with will be adventure to laugh about for long time will indeed other said gleefully how fellow of regiment will envy when tell where have be how about face do think can buy moustache have idea arthur said if ca intend to buy piece of fur with long hair piece of fox skin must do cut out pair of moustache glue on be sure must stand casual inspection must darken face hand little be rather too fair to pas observation a one must know see how must be detected of course must have to alter face a much a possible yes well see have always worn hair long now have cut quite short have not got much eyebrow will put few dab of fur on so a to make heavy draw line up corner above nose so a to give scowl must get man to make line two across forehead think like must do people stare much at other on such occasion attention be principally occupied with looking at bride bridegroom ceremony very well then to morrow evening at stair of san nicola on following evening arthur made way down to river be dressed in simple uniform of carlist officer consisted of tunic red basque cap with breech trouser according to fancy of wearer be first at rendezvous five minute later friend sebastian romero arrived have not be here long hope latter said be kept talking by major just a wanted to disguise have only be here few minute boat be tied to stake think tide have reached yet went down to see directly got here will be afloat in few minute in five minute be off sebastian sitting in stern a arthur took scull will row across to other side at once arthur said by keeping close to bank will not run risk of being detected by outpost on side can row for first mile then a will be nearly opposite can drift up for a much farther by time must be beyond line can cross stream land yes think so other agreed have to get well past hill for certainly have work right up to top of course can see through glass ground be so broken with wall garden house that ca exactly see where strong point be certainly not where carlists be most strongly posted hear such different account from country people who come in can not believe in slightest especially a know that be carlists almost to man must naturally try to deceive with steady stroke arthur rowed along keeping close under bank taking care to avoid making splash presently must hear murmur of talk on opposite bank stopped rowing stream be running up hard in le than hour be well beyond carlists line crossing river then landed at spot from path led up hill sebastian said that uncle house be situated about quarter of mile from top when be once in house sebastian think have better not keep near other then if one be by chance detected other can make bolt for yes think might a well keep apart be more likely to be detected than risk of discovery must be greater for than for a relative must be thought natural must wish to be at wedding might be shot by carlists uncle must take part at rate must be evident that did not come a spy whereas if be caught must be very awkward for though of course must say that came a friend have idea of entering line still must be very awkward if must see that be taken advise to slip quietly off at once arthur however have intention of remaining time at house waiting till companion be ready to leave for latter must certainly object to share in own plan of making way down through carlist line a be going in way a sebastian guest must not very well leave house be quarter of mile friend have said from upper line of work even if detected must with advantage of surprise easily get there before being overtaken not indeed that expected to be pursued intention be to slip away quietly soon after getting to house to stroll down to line where be improbable in extreme that must be challenged if by chance must not turn up sebastian when want to come away have better go down to boat wait there for quarter of hour then push off may not be able to row much must certainly manage to get over to other side then must only have to let drift yes there can be reason why must not come away together well see one other of may be suspected may be necessary to slip off say that be likely at there be nothing like being prepared for emergency after quarter of hour walk reached house be a have expected full of officer friend ceremony have just be concluded many be going up to bride bridegroom offering congratulation music be being played servant be handing round refreshment sebastian joined clustered round newly married pair while arthur mingled with standing in group round room have scarcely be there minute when noticed that eye of two three of neighbour be fixed upon curiously wondering why attention must be attracted to put hand up to face to horror found that moustache be gone have become warm when rowing have doubtless moistened gum with have fastened on to lip at once made for door a left room glanced round saw that three four of men who have observed be speaking together making after moment be outside started to run have gone twenty yard when there be shout behind unexpected discovery have altogether upset plan have calculated on being able to stroll quietly down into carlist line now must have to exert to utmost to get there before pursuer who be close upon ran at top of speed looking round once twice a did so gained on pursuer who now convinced that there be something wrong exerted to utmost to overtake a neared brow of hill must hear talking laughing in front of soon came upon line of fire round soldier be gathered pursuer now though must no longer see began to shout loudly spy spy seize for moment two talk by fire ceased men stood listening to cry be therefore unprepared for action when arthur dashed through have time to choose place knocked over two three who endeavoured to grasp in moment be running down hill with hundred men in pursuit presently saw high embankment ahead of knew must be highest point of defence ran up when reached top jumped be fall of fifteen foot ground be soft where alighted picking up ran on have not gone fifty yard when musket be fired from top of embankment be followed by dozen others fire grew into roar evidently carlists in bewilderment a to what have happened be firing at random presently came to wall vaulted over a number of men ran up what be firing about see be christino surprise said open fire at once will be upon instantly men obeyed order others ran up joined arthur strolled quietly away met number of men running up hurry up hurry up said christinos have attacked from behind carried upper line run on be on way to fetch up men illustration arthur make way through carlist line in five minute fire ceased evidently officer have come down from upper trench passed word along line that alarm be false by time however arthur be distance down hill have little fear of being discovered one indeed paid attention to carlists be discussing meaning of heavy firing sudden cessation officer who have come down from second line explained that be mistake that one must say how have arisen that have be able to gather be that someone have run down that sudden alarm have be given by somebody that troop have fired wildly be enquiring into matter at top of hill at present be mystery arthur spent couple of hour gradually making way down examining defence noting position seeing in strength various loopholed house be held until at last came to lowest line deep trench with high embankment salient thrown out to take attacking force in flank here a everywhere be questioned always replied that a far a knew have be sudden panic possibly attempt by christinos to draw attention to point while attack be made below therefore enjoined to be on guard sallied out at opening in one of angle made for outlying picket to run in if attacked now proceeded very cautiously hundred yard down saw two figure ahead of walked up to be all well asked everything be quiet in front of men said a far a have heard thought that heard heavy body of men marching way be going out little distance to find out be sure that fire at a come back without waiting for answer went on heard one say to other talk queerly did notice thought language seemed strange see did not speak in basque know much spanish anyhow can not do anything now will question when come back again highly satisfied with success arthur walked on until be challenged by sentry ahead answered in english friend for detected at once that challenger belonged to legion who be at came from sentry be one of officer said lieutenant hallett have be in carlist camp come on then let have look at ye be mighty noise that have be makin ' up there yes have be having scrimmage among have now come up to sentry well sor ca see yes man said be clear that be english be good enough for whether be lieutenant hallett not know must be wiser if did see seeing that know gentleman there be dozen of boy down hill with sergeant at house can just make out fifty yard away have best go down to explain right good night arthur walked on arthur be passed without difficulty through outpost when reached town found that sebastian have already returned to own quarter dear friend latter exclaimed springing to foot be delighted to see have be in terrible state of alarm a to safety have just whispered to cousin who be when there be sudden uproar many of guest ran out of room suddenly looked round in vain for there be general confusion five six minute later there be sound of heavy firing rest of guest made off in great hurry of course went out too waited till of company came back none of seemed to know exactly what have happened be of opinion that spy of sort have be discovered at wedding have be pursued have run down through line heavy fire have be opened upon none doubted that be killed curiously enough men of second line of defence have opened fire on in upper one why one knew must only be supposed that believed that christino force have captured upper line of trench did not stop to hear later news made off to boat in hope of finding there waited quarter of hour a told then got in floated down river must not keep to one side a did found that be better to let go a liked fortunately there be such stir in carlist camp passed down river unobserved managed with good deal of difficulty to get boat ashore here have be back now about hour well managed to get through without much difficulty arthur said found out good deal about defence now have better have glass of wine piece of bread be can offer a suppose did not get refreshment up there must be hungry arthur remained for hour then left on following morning went after breakfast to colonel told of adventure of previous evening have done wonderfully well hallett information have gained will be of greatest importance to have better come across with to general at once colonel at first went in alone presently came out again called arthur in so have be into carlist line mr hallett general said be very plucky action please tell about arthur related how when spanish officer have said that must like to go to wedding of cousin idea have struck that if accompanied might obtain information a to carlist line so have encouraged in project have intended to slip away unnoticed unfortunately be betrayed a soon a entered room by loss of portion of moustache then recounted whole adventure handed in full report of carlist defence have that morning written general looked through be of greatest importance to mr hallett be first authentic information have received of position strength of line will be of utmost utility when attack will do before many day have certainly used eye to advantage will study report at leisure will be of greatest use to in making disposition for attack will certainly not forget service have rendered show that have head to plan courage determination to carry idea into effect show also that have made best use of time have acquired sufficient knowledge of spanish to be able to pas a spaniard in short conversation have done very well sir very well indeed if go on a have begun will certainly rise in profession have chosen arthur retired much gratified by general commendation when told adventure to comrade must at first hardly believe until colonel mentioned fact held arthur up a example of what even young officer must accomplish if chose to go out of beaten path to devote to study of language to keep eye open take advantage of opportunity might present charged however to say nothing of outside regiment for san sebastian be full of spy if be known that british officer have made way through line might set to work make such alteration in disposition a must altogether destroy result of arthur observation several of young officer took resolution to follow arthur example begin study of spanish forthwith greater portion said that chance must probably never occur again that be not worth while to work like nigger when odds be so great against good coming from already indeed greater proportion of officer in legion have made up mind to return home at expiration of two year for have be sworn in treatment legion have received unnecessary hardship have to encounter breach of faith of spanish government in not supplying with food keeping for month in arrear with pay thereby causing loss of more than third of number before have fired shot have sickened of whole business be ready to fight be not prepared to starve have ship of war come to take home must have accepted release with joy few of have enlisted because have great interest in cause of queen isabella have joined legion from love of adventure excitement so dominant in englishman six month of delay neglect have roughly disillusioned most of regretted bitterly comfortable home many pleasure have left behind nevertheless for moment be satisfied suffering of men have be quickly forgotten for have enemy in front of be certain that before very long there must be great fight none felt much doubt that in spite of strength of carlist position number of defender must get better of spaniard when came to close quarter prevailing sentiment be beggar have never fought well against french be not likely that will begin now seem to have fought fairly sometimes against other be quite different thing from fighting against be only half drilled fellow now be almost a well drilled a line look much poor chap will fight be put in humour for must go at christinos just a readily a at carlists have come to conclusion that spaniard be brute recollection of what have suffered at hand will make fight furiously be just same thing in peninsular war spaniard never kept promise fellow be starving when men have abundance of everything result be that troop hated infinitely worse than french behaved like demon at capture of badajos ciudad rodrigo month stay at san sebastian did wonder for legion sailor in warship who be filled with pity horror when embarked at santander never came on shore without bringing present of tobacco portion of own ration for shop be well supplied small amount of pay that men have received enabled to buy many little luxury a legion be at time supreme there general evans be enabled to obtain from store fair amount of food men speedily recovered from effect of starvation illness at last preparation be made from manner in staff officer rode to fro with order serving out of ball cartridge other preparation became evident that time for attack be approaching troop rejoiced that be at last to be called upon to play part a men chapter iv first fight for day previous to th of may plan have be formed for attack on enemy line carlists have double line of fortification first of be mile from san sebastian on height behind be numerous others formed principally of steep bank deep lane breastwork of earth behind separated by deep hollow be other height similarly fortified more strongly entrenched armed with several battery main road from san sebastian to aranez ran through ground be strongly barricaded at various point general force consisted of five thousand british fifteen hundred spanish own troop have not yet come up more spanish troop from santander be expected general having seen manner in cordova mismanaged matter not being able to depend upon a tactician determined to attack by evening before attack be to be made various commanding officer addressed men

for over such ground be impossible to advance on horseback two hundred yard in front of convent lay carlist picket so noiselessly be operation carried out that various division reached post assigned to undiscovered a arthur marched along in darkness gave hand in passing to roper good bye old fellow said if be not to meet again may hope to do so in morning squeeze of hand be exchanged passed on be anxious time red glare of enemy picket fire must be seen in distance morning be dark wet there be perfect stillness a took up place assigned to suddenly carlist gave shout of qui vive be answered by shot from one of chapelgorris then there be shout of forward instantly volley broke out from various carlist picket general evans be in front of advancing line order be that men be not to fire to advance well up then charge first house be cleared out picket driven in then for daylight be now breaking troop began to see formidable nature of work before th irish advanced almost without firing shot volley after volley be poured into though dropped fast went steadily on with colonel at head sweeping forward gained long building called windmill battery though five hundred carlists garrisoned loophole great number of enemy fell in about house refusing to surrender a prisoner fighting to last till be finally driven out a general evans came up to exclaimed to th be doing nobly irishman on enemy right equally severe fighting be carried on while th carried windmill battery light brigade succeeded in establishing near driving enemy from other post of similar description colonel tupper be shot through arm while gallantly leading regiment lest officer men must be discouraged threw cloak around to hide held on with regiment two hour longer when be again facing heavy fire be shot through

more than quarter of entire strength total loss be seventy five officer eight hundred forty eight private many of wounded died after engagement four piece of artillery be taken when fight be over arthur hallett leant against wall panting exhausted seemed to almost like dream must hardly believe that have come through desperate struggle without scratch excepting only when for time be brought to stand still by fort lugariz regiment have be incessantly fighting now pushing forward now falling back now broken up into party now gathering together again sometimes loading firing a quickly a possible at wall house from flashed shot a quickly in return then dashing over wall across garden storming house driving before there have be anxious time when must not struggle up to foot of fort be forced to lie quiet to shield a best must from fire from summit until vessel of war beat down angle of wall to make entrance seemed to well nigh impossible that must have come out of turmoil alive be soon however aroused bugle be ringing out unwounded men formed up in order that name must be taken after work of collecting wounded began in earnest be glad to see have come out right hallett captain buller said poor prince be killed must think pretty nearly company be sharpest fight ever went through if have be much sharper there must not have be anyone left to tell story be sorry to see that be hurt sir wound be not serious be thrust with bayonet through arm however have got majority have got five six step before owing to men being sent home must think there must be at least seven eight vacancy now among lieutenant one only consolation be that be ill wind blow one good a soon a roll be called work of carrying down wounded began arthur have time to go look for roper to great satisfaction found that also be uninjured exchanged hearty hand shake be very fortunate to have got through roper be glad indeed other said wondered several time how be faring there be very little time for thinking must talk over with other when have leisure must help to get poor fellow down before can think of anything else well be satisfactory that have have good fight at last have begun to have great doubt whether be ever going to fight at yes can not say more that legion be of use for fighting have be first chance think have made most of then separated be late in afternoon before work of collecting wounded be finished in meantime number of townspeople have be hired to dig graf by dead be buried of troop slept on ground have won rest marched down into town ration be served out a soon a be cooked eaten went to sleep arthur regiment be one of remained on hill officer gathered in one of house have be carried by storm body of dead carlists have be carried out fire have be lighted after have eaten meal arthur two other officer started on round to see that watch be vigilant for carlists have not fallen back far might at moment make attempt to recover lost ground of have two orderly carried lantern night be dark be next to impossible to make way about over broken ground be still thickly strewn with dead carlists be heartily glad when hour later be gathered by fire a must have to turn out again in hour agreed that be of use to sleep chatted in low tone of event of day agreed that have be worse than have expected that enemy have fought with great bravery be sturdy fellow not to be despised captain said certainly did not think must fight so well if have fought like against french there must have be occasion for to send army to help however have right to be proud of legion have done gallantly be pity that have lost something like three thousand men by sickness must have made vast difference if have have full force here anyhow be lucky arthur said that other two regiment came up in middle of for have fairly brought to stand still well suppose be time for to turn out again at rate be consolation that will get sleep to morrow next day general sent for arthur must thank again said for information gained for mr hallett for think must have managed to win way so far for learnt from weak strong point be able to take several of most formidable redoubt must otherwise think have be more than must manage will have pleasure in mentioning name in report of action will remember if anyone be wanted for special service thank sir can assure have never thought of such thing only carried out plan in hope might gain information must be useful to when time came to attack have already be extremely fortunate in obtaining commission although altogether without interest can only hope that in future may again be able in way to be of use to arthur afterwards went to have chat with roper well roper have have first battle what did think of have time to think about at be just load fire 'go at lad then falling back then trying again be certainly good deal worse than have expected think be frightened one idea be that wanted to get at be good deal like what felt roper know wondered occasionally that lived through storm of musket ball sometimes seemed a if nothing must exist in time be astonished at courage carlists showed have so made up mind that must not stand against for moment be quite taken aback when found that be fighting just a hard a not quite so hard roper arthur said fought hard admit when got among with bayonet always have best of beggar must stand bullet did not like steel lost heavily sir be sorry to say that did lost particularly heavily among officer yes sir everyone be saying how gallantly showed way hardly expected of to do so well of course one have mean of knowing there be sort of general idea that officer who doe look after men seem to take interest in be not sort of fellow who must lead well in fight see why must be so roper man may be very kind hearted yet not extraordinarily plucky while on other hand pretty hard sort of man may have amount of courage suppose be so sir somehow one seems to think that man who be good fellow one way will be good fellow when off duty of officer must often go out for sail one day four of friend asked arthur to accompany think weather look very settled said still there may be change till be back anyhow be ready to go be right know understand managing boat be more than can be said for rest of propose to be out more than two three hour well make change anyhow after drill be over there be little enough to do in town till evening be all right then better class seem to sleep during day at rate show outside house though be friendly enough when meet on promenade be very chary of asking to call anything of sort except when have regular reception accordingly went down hired boat put out sail be hoisted a wind be dead behind ran out merrily passed within quarter of mile of men of war there be man on ship waving arm shouting arthur said rather think be shouting to expect be shouting to someone on other ship one of others replied illustration sail be hoisted ran out merrily thought more of kept course when have gone five mile arthur said think have better be making for home again will have to beat way wind be freshening besides like look of cloud coming up over hill others who be enjoying said oh will go bit farther must be pity to cut trip short held on for couple of mile then arthur said be sure have better turn hardly recognize how hard wind be blowing be running before keep on even keel will find matter altogether different when have once put about well turn if like hallett really seems pity well before bring into wind have better let sail run down put two reef into fancy will have to reef close down before have done others saw by serious expression on arthur face that be thoroughly in earnest lowered sail reefed a soon a be done arthur put helm down boat came up into wind a did so heeled over so far that one two of others grasped gunwale fearing that be going over be all right at present arthur said a started off on new course wish be five mile nearer land can see wo look up very near wind will have long beat before get in hour later sail be close reefed even under small spread of canvas heeled over till lee rail be close to water be right hallett be fool not to follow advice one of others said know much about sailing understand enough to see that have very tough job before wind be getting stronger moment five minute later arthur said there be black squall coming across water have better lower sail altogether till have passed have very strong hope however that will be over for time there be break in cloud have quite lost sight of shore advice be taken mast be lowered sail rolled up two officer got out oar have better get out arthur said be a much a will be able to do to keep head to storm now row quietly squall will be on in couple of minute when come will have to put whole strength into be fortunate that be steering with short oar if have have rudder must never have kept straight for will be hardly moving through water there be sudden splash of rain then pause then came down in bucketful while wind literally howled for time exertion of four rower of arthur at steering oar kept head straight after quarter of hour rower unaccustomed to prolonged exertion began to flag arthur changed place with stroke oar boat again made little way advantage gained by strength be more than counterbalanced by want of skill of helmsman at end of five minute rowing boat head fell off wind caught whirled round oar in arthur shouted will take helm again four have better sit down in bottom of boat big sea will be getting up very soon how long be going to last sinclair said when have crouched at bottom of boat may last two three day wind must not be in worse quarter if shift might make coast of spain france be south easter will blow right out into bay be lucky brought two bottle of wine that loaf of bread with will want badly before see land again wish to goodness have run in to man of war have doubt at now that man be hailing that be going to caution against going out farther however wishing be useless have got to grin bear be fool not to take advice earlier hallett think must have made much difference arthur said if have turned then must not have got back before squall struck must have be blown out just a have be now be now sitting in bottom of boat also still holding steering oar there be however little to do with boat be running straight before wind what pace do think be going through water sharman shouted for must scarcely hear other speak about six seven knot must say then if go on for three day will be something like five hundred mile out arthur nodded hope wo keep on blowing a long a besides there may be shift in wind must enable to make france spain if not have only one chance be may be picked up by passing ship there be little more talk be sitting close together in stern a arthur said that by so doing greater draught aft must enable boat to keep course dead before wind without steering felt that be more cheerful being thus close together even if there be nothing to talk about sinclair proposed that must have little wine to warm arthur at once said must not think of thing have have breakfast must last till to morrow morning may have to eke out wine for fortnight two bottle be of vital importance to a long a keep on raining will not suffer from thirst by way must be good plan to shake out sail spread on seat with oar over lashed into place by sheet in way will be able to catch water run off in baler there be lot in bottom yes be principally sea water have better shift bit forward wave be beginning to break over stern must keep more on even keel night came on gale be blowing with unabated force sea be high boat rode easily over for be large craft must have required double number on board to take down to bearing fortunately water be warm so while there be not dry thread on did not suffer from cold a night came on rearranged sail put one of stretcher across boat with end resting on gunwale five foot from bow oar be lashed to sloping downward into bottom of boat over sail be fastened thus making sort of tent sufficiently large for to lie under be worn out by buffeting of wind in spite of tossing of boat hardness of board drenched clothes fell asleep before long morning be breaking when awoke there be change except that sea be running much higher first thing did be to bale out boat then bottle be opened little wine measured out carefully into wine glass have be brought on board loaf of bread have be placed in locker have fortunately kept dry slice of be cut off divided into five portion be meagre breakfast felt better after pipe cigar be then lighted began to talk what chance do think there be of vessel picking up hallett really ca say there ought to be fair chance if wind be blowing in same direction a when started must take out must think pretty well into course of ship going south there be besides vessel making for bordeaux other french port will be hard if run across of a have four oar sail must be able to cut off a come in yes think chance be good even now one of ought always to keep on watch rain have ceased falling air be still thick heavy cloud be passing overhead at one o'clock however began to break two hour later sun shone out brightly be comfort arthur said in first place will dry in second place will cheer in third will enable to see long way stood up looked round can see nothing at present said be only when get on top of wave that can see distance about five o'clock in evening made out sail be long way off be already to west of be seen at once that must be absolutely useless to try row after ship a be running rapidly along although under very small amount of canvas still sight of vessel cheered have seen one there be reason why must not see more now knew that wind be blowing more from south than have done that be therefore running to north be advantage for must be making rather towards than away from french coast when wind fell might hope to reach next morning wind have dropped good deal day be bright clear allowed double portion of wine bread then got mast up undid lashing of sail hoisted way up making hole in canvas by must put extra reef in under very reduced canvas be able to sail comfortably though of have to sit up to windward wind have come still more round to west of south so be able to lay course due east how far be off land do think hallett well have be about sixty six hour out by course ran first twenty four made at six knot hour about hundred forty four mile must put must say something like seventy to nearest point of france next twenty four hour be running nearly north so during time must have kept about same distance from coast last night must have be approaching rather than running away from well be now going about four knot through water if wind fall more can put up more sail will walk along little faster until sea go down think can calculate upon making above five knot if be now a suppose nearly in line with mouth of loire may not be more than thirty forty mile from shore for although pretend to be particularly well up in geography know that french coast run out good deal west till get to brest at twelve o'clock sinclair stood up looked round can make out dark line said over there to left look to like land must have seen before for sail arthur be a usual steering others went forward to have look sinclair took helm for minute to allow to do so be land certainly said must say that be stretching out towards brest think have better keep straight on may take few more hour to get to shore must save lot of travelling if be to strike mouth of loire instead of brest at rate be safe now can venture upon slice of bread full glass of wine glass half in fact will still leave with bottle for breakfast to morrow morning may fairly calculate upon being close to land by time others be rather in favour of running to land saw well look here arthur said think that must be great deal easier to travel hundred mile in boat than to tramp same distance besides coast believe be very rocky way along there might find difficulty in landing own idea be that when do make land must go ashore find out where be lay in good stock of provision start south again with wind a be now must very nearly lie course must certainly do so if wind go round point two farther know what money fellow have have only dollar two in pocket examined store total only amounted to thirteen dollar thirteen dollar must go distance towards taking down through france must not pay for conveyance quarter of distance to say nothing about food even if walked must hardly pay for bread cheese must have to sleep in open then too might have deal of difficulty in getting into spain without passport if did get in must find almost impossible to make way to san sebastian a several place on frontier be in hand of carlista therefore will certainly stick to boat if prefer to tramp can do so know that before have gone more than day march will begin to feel very sorry that did not take advice there be lot in what say hallett sharman said for one will certainly stick to others at once agreed to idea arthur being only one who knew anything of sailing have throughout voyage acted a captain fact that have carried through storm safely have given others great confidence in must say arthur went on when make land may a well stop for twenty four hour people will probably treat hospitably a shipwrecked mariner put up feed will be glad of twenty four hour rest by time be ready to start again sea will have gone down will set out like lion refreshed with wind anywhere north of east west will be able to lie course comfortably even if wind be light ought to make eighty hundred mile day three day will take easily to san sebastian sun be just setting when saw land ahead of by ten o'clock be close to must make out that be island cape running out into sea sailed to north side of sea be smooth so running boat ashore got out on to low beach walking inland for distance threw down in field a ground be soft in comparison with board at bottom of boat be very soon sound asleep in morning finished loaf wine then returned to beach ascending rising ground saw that mile along shore there be village standing at little distance from sea towards place therefore made way a entered village be regarded with look of astonishment by native be not in uniform clothes have shrunk considerably in long drenching sharman have lost cap looked faded bedraggled three day short ration have left mark on face sinclair fortunately spoke little french be able to make villager understand that have be blown off coast of spain in storm have landed late previous evening mile away cure of village at once took in in short time sat down to hearty meal to did full justice told cure that intended to start next morning to sail down coast learned from that place where have landed be island of st nazaire that be twenty mile from mainland think must not do better than sail along coast said once make mainland will find village little port at short distance at can buy anything want of course will always keep within sight of land except when cross mouth of gironde know how be off for money gentleman will be happy to supply with can send to when have opportunity be very much obliged to sir sinclair said have thirteen dollar between will buy ample supply of thing for voyage intend to land will sail on night day two of be quite sufficient to manage boat can sleep by turn thirteen dollar will be quite enough if have fine weather fair wind must not go far if have to stop think there be fear of bad wind there must hardly be two storm one after at end of month of may indeed think must run short of money be to be eight nine day on voyage wine be only suppose about sixpence litre if reckon litre day of wine allow franc for bread a much for meat victual will only cost dollar half day must treat to franc worth of fruit still have enough money to last week priest smiled well sir at rate can doubt do comfortably admit that thirteen dollar will be ample if make run in five day certainly will do unless get wind right in teeth dined at priest house provided bed for two of found accommodation for others in of cottage did shopping that afternoon arranged to start at daybreak next morning succeeded in doing after thanking good priest very heartily for hospitality many of villager have be down on previous day to look at boat have lived through gale of others have now come to see off headed east so a to make shore a soon a possible for agreed that a must have nothing to guide in case of thick weather coming on be best to make mainland then follow down at distance of mile so wind be blowing now from north west spreading full canvas ran down rapidly past island three hour after saw french coast ahead be now in high spirit have made wonderful voyage be able to chat gaily over talk there must be at san sebastian concerning disappearance only hope there wo be fight before be back arthur said must be horribly annoying if be certain of must feel quite happy over adventure weather continued fine throughout voyage wind be somewhat light sufficient to take along at between four five mile hour on evening of third day after starting saw highland of spain rising in front of on following morning ran into harbour of san sebastian where be hailed a if returning from grave by companion who have given up for lost certainly must have be if have be for hallett sinclair said kept wit about whole time got to rig shelter stuck to helm a long a steering must do good general sent for heard account of voyage well said be well that end well congratulate on marvellous escape moreover have lost nothing for there have be no more fighting since left chapter v furious struggle time passed slowly skirmishing went on constantly party worked at entrenchment shot be exchanged by battery from time to time soldier be in better spirit a certain amount of pay due be handed to for time even grumbler be contented drilling went on regularly be done smartly well sunday be great day of week spanish colour be hoisted early cannon fired salute church bell began to ring spaniard male female rich poor started by six o'clock for cathedral be so crowded that very many be forced to kneel outside on plaza in front of other church being taken up a magazine storehouse at seven o'clock service be over shopkeeper began to open store country people others thronged great square although firing went on a usual sport be held down on sand when market be cleared away plaza be soon filled with dancer principally girl who danced to guitar in crowd be spanish english officer grave don better class of town woman in black silk dress mantilla peasant beggar soldier sailor many must stroll to rampart watch firing till eight o'clock at hour spaniard went to bed street be quiet save for occasional drunken soldier patrol party then there be long interval without pay caused serious disaffection several of regiment broke into open mutiny absolutely refused to obey order to leave barrack of mutiny lasted for fortnight be caused partly by want of pay partly because many of men believed that have enlisted only for year now that period of service be drawing to end considered that ship must be arriving to take home officer be greatly puzzled what to do be extremely doubtful whether of regiment be still obedient must if called upon to do so fire upon mutineer be morally certain that if did so disaffection must be so great that whole legion must fall to piece officer went about among mutineer trying to get to return to duty of regiment be pacified by distributing small sum of money among others be reduced by stopping supply of ration gradually thing settled down again desultory fire have be going on for so many week be succeeded on st of october by series of attack by carlists heavy firing broke out at three o'clock in morning shot after shot falling in town so well aimed be that none doubted that gunner be one john wilson deserter from legion who have once be in royal artillery there have be many desertion from time to time carlists be constantly shouting invitation to men to come over to promising good pay good treatment offer very enticing to men on small ration pay a fire broke out column of carlist infantry advanced driving picket before of threw into house defended against overwhelming number rd regiment rifle be first to reach scene of action many of running up in shirt with tunic unbuttoned having leapt to foot seized rifle hurried off without moment delay drum be beating bugle sounding over town non commissioned officer turning men out a fast a must officer be riding about getting men to fall in a arrived be formed up behind wall other shelter rd rifle have checked carlist advance a th regiment formed up cannon shot from carlist fort on ametza hill fell close to group of officer many of whom be knocked down by stone thrown up then went through column killing one man knocking down dozen others men however laughed joked among next ball went right through horse of mounted officer killed two soldier behind woman who be out looking for husband body having just got news that have be killed artillery have now come on scene directed by colonel colquhoun admirable scientific officer soon got range levelled one of cannon at column of carlists mile distant ball burst just at right moment committed great havoc gunner of other piece in battery under instruction opened terrible fire upon column that broke disappeared then laid three gun on ametza fort be fired simultaneously to delight of soldier burst on parapet carrying death confusion among gunner killing among others deserter who have given so much trouble up till ten o'clock carlists maintained offensive at hour lancer came on to field charged in gallant style on south east side of ametza hill carlists gave way ran until reached breastwork here be impossible for cavalry to follow at once drew off under very heavy fire then charged again again at various party scattered over plain moving in a perfect order a if on parade doing great execution for fact that spanish entrenchment be so extensive a to afford shelter for scattered fugitive loss inflicted upon must have be extremely heavy special object of carlist attack have be village fort of alza be defended by two spanish regiment one of legion battery repelled attack with great slaughter dog belonging to legion have taken part in fight always marching at head of regiment distinguished greatly in battle strangely enough never barked except in face of enemy have be twice wounded on occasion in company with spanish friend of own specie advanced retreated with lancer have gone on for distance where ball be flying thick during one advance spaniard tumbled over came back hopping on three foot briton looked back must not retreat stood barking defiance at enemy presently ball slightly wounded in throat returned to companion who be hobbling away tried to turn repeatedly offered to lead charge by advancing short distance presently got wound on head men lying in shelter called to came in got wound partially dressed then at once set off again spanish friend have in meantime be killed briton having in vain tried to make rise came back to men endeavoured to get to go out carry friend in national guard of san sebastian turned out well have regular uniform carried bandolier filled with cartridge rifle many of woman who came out with men took shelter in wood assisted in carrying in wounded general evans rode about with greatest coolness through heavy fire although hundred of bullet be aimed at be only hit once through ear so fight continued day until night put end to attempt be made to storm spanish position a general evans mentioned in despatch must not have be effected without loss of at least five hundred men capture of entrenchment must have be dear at price after battle there be interval of quiet arrangement have be made by general evans with spanish commander that must not take offensive until be ready to co operate with force be therefore again set to work to entrench a men received pint of wine threepence three farthing day in addition to usual twopence halfpenny service be very popular one extra pay sufficed to keep soldier from grumbling extra food that be able to purchase put into better condition one of well known figure in town be general jauregui have be in turn shepherd half soldier half guerrilla when war broke out raised body of volunteer for queen soon attained rank of general be not liked by officer under many of whom be noble be beloved by men have many relation in rank be not ashamed to sit down eat talk with possessed rare peculiarity in spaniard of being fat month passed not until th of march did become known that advance be to take place next morning secret be made of a general desire be that carlists must gather to resist for wished to strike heavy blow man be given peseta equal to tenpence halfpenny to buy tobacco other necessary shop of town be crowded day with british soldier good deal of money be invested in chocolate for be thought probable that battle must last more than one day in case ration must not be served out there be going to bed that night fire be kept blazing everywhere cooking pot be hung over extra flint be served out new shoe for in need of men exchanged with other address of relation in order that news might be sent to if be killed night men sat joked until officer went round ordered to fall in quietly spanish regiment have already turned out taken up place on glacis in close column behind one of battery a day broke men be called to attention almost simultaneously battery opened fire column marched against ametza with such resolution that garrison evacuated hurriedly leaving many thousand of round of ammunition behind fighting be desperate along line one rocky hill be taken retaken five time during day terror of scene be added to by fact that furze on hill caught fire from explosion of shell many wounded be burned to death many of place be thickly dotted with red coat of legion fight continued day troop lay down slept on ground have won upwards of thousand have fallen carlists must have suffered much more severely for have be exposed to fire of artillery while have gun in action next day passed quietly artilleryman being occupied in getting gun up on to height have won on second day after battle in spite of pouring rain advance began again artillery cleared way turning carlists out of house occupied troop crossed river by bridge of boat moved on without serious opposition be glad when order came to halt occupy house of deserted village little beyond village there be hard fight next day at night troop fell back to house have occupied in morning rain still came down on following morning at twelve cleared carlists lay concealed until column got very near to then opened tremendous fire at three o'clock engagement have become general of troop fired away ammunition then charged with bayonet before weapon carlists always fell back although must stand against heaviest musketry fire strongest point of defence of carlists be venta hill round battle raged day in afternoon be decided to make final attempt to take th regiment of legion be in camp be about to start on attack when general evans rode up can not go on with one regiment colonel hogg said there will be more up very shortly oh allow general to go on colonel hogg said be sure can get through breastwork then turning to regiment be in close column said men must rather go on by yourselves wait for others to come on to help have chance here that will not divide with regiment men answered with tremendous cheer go on then brave fellow general evans said regiment advanced artillery be hard at work scream of rocket sounded over din of musketry gun regiment with loud cheer emerged from cover concealed a did so blaze of fire ran along enemy defence four mounted officer galloped at head man cheered a ran down into road then up again through hedge across broken ground storm of bullet swept through gun on height played upon with grape fortunately most of missile went overhead reached first barricade colonel be first to mount others climbed up majority be so out of breath with shouting pace at have run that be forced to pause barricade be built of turf be too steep to be climbed men set to work to tear down with hand soon made passage through must pas there be active opposition here for gun sent shell so thickly among carlists that be impossible for to withstand a th poured through found ground nearly covered with dead bugle now sounded halt men be not to be restrained eagerly pressed forward till reached top of hill carlists have evacuated a neared here battery of four gun be taken flag flying above hauled down in battery be found two barrel one of wine other of spirit tremendous rush took place while men be frantically fighting there be explosion shout of there be mine underneath frightful rush to got away from spot took place in midst of soldier calmly walked forward filled canteen that of two of comrade action considerably reassured others panic soon abated when be found that there be more explosion turned out afterwards that man who have shown such coolness have not be able to get near cask have quietly taken out of ammunition from cartridge box laid on ground under foot of fighting to get at liquor shaken out fire from pipe on to however content of cask be soon finished regiment be then re formed a be dark lay down in field have won way thus far have reached limit news of fighting have be carried by active men over country be evident that farther advance of legion must place in possession of main road to france reinforcement be called up from side already evans be opposed by force far more numerous than own when news of advance arrived carlist within fifty mile be on road espartero who be with army round bilbao have promised to march general saarsfield who commanded royal army be also to have moved so a to occupy enemy attention have done so carlist army have be week before withdrawn from before saarsfield during night of th ten thousand men slipped away from force facing that of espartero crossed mountain to assist friend espartero have ridden when heard of progress that evans be making to see with own eye how matter be going on fighting have again begun carlists have already be driven back into town of hernani when don sebastian one of son of carlos arrived with ten thousand infantry three hundred cavalry marched out column after column vast superiority of number enabled to not only show in force in face of allied army to threaten flank for time legion spanish ally held ground firmly have considerably more than twice number opposed to flank be gradually driven in towards centre rifle who be on one flank have fought with obstinate bravery on other two irish regiment stubbornly faced overwhelming force of carlists be engaged in hand to hand fight with colonel cotter of th cork be conspicuous for gallantry alone rode repeatedly into leading carlist rank until be completely surrounded fell fighting to last th th th regiment who be in reserve be soon drawn forward into fight th be first called up whole of carlist cavalry dashed forward to attack leading company alone be available to meet be received with tremendous volley that be driven backward in great confusion with immense loss two howitzer of marine artillery sent shower of grape among of fine regiment have advanced shattered group of fugitive returned carlists working round threatened artillery be only saved by desperate charge of lancer staunchness of two company of th spanish regiment fought badly by retreat exposed legion to heavy cross fire compelled to fall back th last regiment of reserve who have be lying concealed in hollow be then called up two hundred of wounded have be left behind in large house a carlists advanced be bayoneted to man th went boldly forward answering nobly to colonel hogg call upon to charge rushed under tremendous fire to wall on other side of strong force of carlists stood while many be already crossing th dashed forward bayoneted who have crossed wall for time fought carlist battalion crowded behind other troop be pushing on to right left so threatened on flank with overpowering force in front th sullenly fell back broken up into party still fought desperately be only saved by furious charge by lancer carlists unprepared for cavalry broke in confusion thus survivor of th be able to draw off regiment of chapelgorris have distinguished during day have refused to be brigaded with other spanish regiment fought by side of british with most desperate valour be indeed almost annihilated nevertheless few survivor of th nobly beat back attack of carlists there be regiment of royal marine on ground be prevented by lord john haye who commanded from taking prominent part in fight lost eighteen men wounded none killed while legion have lost very many hundred two three regiment being almost wiped out retreating force passed height of venta have so gallantly won four day before only halted when reached line have occupied previous to th arthur have borne full share in incident of terrible day have fought a fearlessly a best have brought remains of company out of fray captain being among many officer who have fallen so great have be slaughter that found at end of day high in list of lieutenant have received three wound be slight have broken sword in hand to hand encounter with carlist officer have ended fight by striking opponent full in face with pommel stretching senseless on ground when reached line went across to roper company to great pleasure found that friend have escaped with only bullet through arm have be dreadful day mr terrible day roper three to one against must say there be made stiff fight of sir legion have right to be proud of if spanish regiment have not given way think might have held own with doubt whether must in case roper be altogether too strong for still must have done better if spaniard have stood might at rate have retired in good order to venta hill held that against attack carlists might have made hope will never see such fighting again same here roper said think thousand of can do fairly well against two thousand of carlists when come to twenty thousand against about four thousand odds be too great altogether for one can say that carlists fight well be lucky sir that lancer arrived when did for think of must have got away alive if have be for quite made up mind that have got to go down when came thundering up be indeed most fortunate thing roper during last part of day have be fighting with musket among men for broke sword pistol be of use in fight like well be going off now to see if can be of good in hospital surgeon must have hand more than full arthur offer of aid be thankfully received worked night assisting surgeon by holding patient while amputation be being carried out handing sponge hot water generally aiding in operation when morning came be so fatigued that made way with difficulty to quarter in town where flung down to snatch few hour sleep there be great hush over camp during day then only a men wandered about asking question concerning missing comrade did full extent of disaster have befallen make felt gap in rank be terrible missing comrade be gone for carlists have given quarter even if not seriously wounded who fell into hand be either shot bayoneted by be hard after having fought way victoriously for three day that misfortune must befall legion one consolation be that man have done duty not one have turned back to foe gap among officer have be terrible several of regiment have lost field officer others have suffered greatly deep be execration upon spanish general who must have detained carlist army facing who by lethargy have allowed twenty thousand men to slip away join with whom legion have be so successfully engaged not few of men must willingly have obeyed order to attack spanish regiment who have deserted a soon a fighting began at first be anticipated that carlists must take advantage of success attempt to capture san sebastian there be general hope that must do so for felt confident that must resist attack might be made entrenchment be very formidable number of heavy gun be mounted upon gun of ship too must give support carlists be well satisfied with success greater portion of troop have come from durango force opposed to espartero have marched away again leaving only sufficient number to oppose further attempt on part of defender of san sebastian to take offensive of however there be little prospect scarce three thousand five hundred out of ten thousand men of legion be fit for service disease battle have accounted for rest besides of two year for have enlisted there be few month to run have be treated well by far greater portion must willingly have remained at first have felt small interest in struggle in have enlisted most of be ne'er do weels men who have be glad to accept offer with prospect of giving living christinos be more to than carlists now case be altogether different carlists have become personal enemy must not have come to hate for doings in fair fight fact that massacred man who fell into hand whether wounded not have raised in mind of soldier feeling of undying hatred burning desire for revenge have not received treatment have right to expect have never be properly fed since landed be still month in arrears of pay then only irregularly received wretched pittance of twopence halfpenny day if spanish government have deliberately set to drive regiment into mutiny must not have gone about better be certain that when time expired few indeed must consent to remain longer in rank officer be le indignant than men pay be nine month in arrear who have mean of own have only subsisted by assistance of others better off than considering what went through be almost matter for surprise that whole legion did not embrace offer of carlist emissary who be constantly at work trying to sap loyalty to christino cause go over in body to carlist line after revers have befallen spanish government seemed more indifferent than ever to suffering only very occasionally ridiculously small amount be sent to sufficient to pay soldier few peseta apiece in circumstance be not surprising that drill became slack discipline relaxed officer deeply indignant must not bring to be severe upon soldier who suffered even more than so took notice of minor act of insubordination shortly after battle arthur have received usual quarterly letter from uncle dear arthur ran herewith enclose order a usual on messrs callao of san sebastian for thirty pound be very glad to find that have passed through last battle without serious wound have be most fortunate in respect term of service will end in few month time trust at conclusion will return home be afraid that after life have be leading can hardly hope that will resume study indeed must not be reasonable to expect still might travel otherwise employ great deal better surely than in getting shot at that in cause although doubt now feel interest can not affect in same way a if be fighting for own country according to other account from letter have seen from other member of legion must have be suffering great hardship doubt at san sebastian have be le cruel than be at vittoria still have be severe tell very little about a say be from other source form opinion be obliged to for always writing directly after battle for be in state of considerable anxiety until hear from a of course detail of casualty be published in interval between first report of fighting receipt of letter be very unsettled cousin study be greatly deranged talk think of very frequently be afraid that be inclined to pride on having relative who have won commission distinguished in spain still dear lad do hope that if term of service of legion be to be extended think that probably will be will not be among who remain in service risk appear to be enormous more than legion be by time dead invalided home ask what can compensate man for running such risk especially when a in case be not driven by straitened circumstance to incur have done well have so to speak won spur will be something to look back upon life surely that be good enough first enlistment be to mind wild foolish business own annoyed a then be must be still more so be to repeat mistake pray think over seriously remember pecuniarily have need to remain in legion tell that have still most of money have sent lying by have three more year to wait till majority when will receive three hundred pound year if necessary can add something to amount cousin insist that must be now almost man a say that be over six foot doubt life that have led must have aged good deal hope taken of foolish recklessness out of have asked to say that hope wo bring home spanish lady a wife have assured that although consider capable of many folly feel convinced that will not commit such crowning one a wife send love earnest hope prayer in join that will come home safe sound to remain dear arthur affectionate uncle to arthur replied dear uncle many thanks for letter remittance a to what say about continuing term of service in event of legion a whole re enlisting for further term can not promise to take particular course at present say that can have interest in cause for be fighting can assure that have very vivid interest in grant that be not case at first that looked upon in mere spirit of adventure be changed carlists be not like civilized enemy behave rather like wild beast give quarter poor fellow who fall into hand officer soldier be shot bayoneted at once even wounded be slaughtered ruthlessly now can very well imagine state of fury hatred excited by such doings war have become war of revenge men when go into battle hope that if be hit will be by fatal shot not by one will lay helpless on ground with certainty of being shot bayoneted in cold blood unless carlists be beaten hold ground on have fought say that be entirely fault of carlists for in early part of war christinos be just a bad from what hear however be state of thing now if legion be well treated think there be scarcely man who must not willingly extend term fact have be promoted be reason why might be tempted to go on of course will make difference to afterwards whether hold rank of lieutenant colonel at end of war now have gone into thing want to see end of however think that need feel uneasy on score for be convinced that when term have expired greater part of legion will take discharge treatment have be so scandalous that believe that if order be given for legion to march to madrid fight way through obstacle hang member of government must receive with joy a to what girl say about spanish lady assure that though be really man in stature strength be still boy at heart be more affected by pretty grace of of spanish girl than if be doll be very jolly to chaff with certainly in case nothing to make love to hope that by next time write will be able to tell have got company with love to yours affectionately arthur hallett chapter vi captive have heard that maltravers be missing hallett sinclair asked arthur one morning a came out of quarter missing how be missing be what nobody seems to know be on duty last night went along line certain distance then seems to have disappeared enquiry be being made among men on duty so far there doe not seem to be explanation certainly be not shot for there be sign of body one idea be that might have be taken suddenly ill turned off to come into town to report believe search be being made now on ground that must cross to see if have fallen there of course one think that must have deserted must think not arthur said there be men who grumble so continuously that one must hardly be surprised to hear that have taken other service be not at maltravers way always made best of everything well be very strange most exhaustive search failed to bring anything to light respecting missing officer sentry at last post have visited have observed nothing singular in manner next post be three hundred yard away although be dark night officer must not have missed way there be sharp drop in ground beyond line that must traverse a route be same have be used for many month be scarcely possible that anyone must miss idea that carlists must have come down from entrenchment nearest of be four hundred yard away captured without sound of struggle reaching ear of sentry to right left seemed hardly possible suggested that might have gone suddenly out of mind wandered down into town to bank of urumea there fallen in seemed to to be wildly improbable officer letter paper be examined nothing be found that must in slightest support idea that have committed suicide there be nothing to do to enter name upon list of missing hope that must yet turn up day explain mystery be turn for night duty hallett sinclair said to three day after strange disappearance of maltravers yes know that turn for duty begin evening well keep sharp look out old fellow want more mysterious disappearance in regiment one be more than sufficient have be over ground dozen time during past three day in hope of finding sort of clue without least success perhaps a go round to night bright idea may strike of one thing said with laugh may be perfectly sure be that if turn up in morning will be desertion suicide insanity sinclair said must certainly never suspect of one of three others laughed certainly did best to save life on board boat so will put suicide out of question a to desertion lunacy think may be equally barred if be missing will say that pixy have carried off yes think can safely put down to after mess be over arthur took pistol sword started to house be used a rendezvous of officer on duty for night made usual visit to outlying post along portion of line three quarter of mile in extent returned few minute before twelve again started on same tramp companion on duty going in other direction nothing unusual happened until be half way along then a passed ruined hut suddenly fell stunned by heavy blow from behind knew nothing for time then felt dimly conscious that be being carried along reviving consciousness showed that there be two men at arm two at leg that cloak other woollen garment be wrapped round round head something thrust into mouth be taken in little by little for head buzzed ached from blow have fallen upon be time before brain began to work in earnest then gradually came to understand that be in hand of carlists four men must have stolen quietly down from entrenchment hidden among ruin of hut struck to ground probably with butt end of musket be now carrying off doubtless be manner in maltravers have also be captured knew that to struggle must be absolutely useless indeed from murmur of talk went on around judged that be already in carlist line must feel that be being taken up hill after what seemed very long time bearer came to stop door be pushed open be carried through dropped on ground then heard door close lock turn sat up took muffler from head gag from mouth head ached a if must split so knowing that there be nothing to be done rolled up muffler using a pillow dozed off after time into heavy sleep when awoke heard talking outside be second five dollar have made pedro if go on like will soon get rich see why must other said a long a night be dark can always be sure of making way down unobserved may reckon on snatching two three more before there be moon even then will be able to do when there be rain suppose can catch many more way other said when find officer keep on disappearing will send three four of men round with then of course there will be end of business still if can catch dozen more will not have done so badly a soon a day broke arthur sat up looked round have still splitting headache there be lump a big a egg where blow have fallen cap lay upon ground near having apparently be thrown in there by men who have carried up arm have be taken away have doubt that nothing have be left behind must leave indication a to what have befallen hut be about twelve foot square have evidently be inhabited by peasant contained two three broken piece of rough furniture floor be littered with odds end of old garment broken crockery c two little loophole about six inch square admitted certain amount of light when door be closed looking out of saw that hut stood on level ground evidently at top of hill number of carlists lay on ground wrapped up in cloak two three small hut house be dotted here there on plain nearest of being about two hundred yard away one have garden round looked a if be still inhabited like hut in be confined be built of stone be roofed with slab of same material be larger apparently have upper story loft having seen much sat down until by stir around knew that camp be awake be not until a near a must guess nine o'clock for watch have be taken away from that anyone came near though knew by talking that there be two sentry at door then heard key turn in lock officer who by uniform thought be colonel entered arthur rose to foot be english sir colonel said be why do fight on side of christinos know that be badly treated by be half starved get pay well sir be prisoner in hand need hardly say what fate will be if accept term if will enter service of don carlos will be well fed well paid welcomed a comrade can make difference to on side fight christino carlist have learned what to expect from neglect suffering with will have be certain to win in long run will get promotion honour alternative be death will leave till evening to think over matter went out in quarter of hour two soldier entered bearing dish of meat bean large jug of water arthur have appetite took copious drink poured water over cloak rolled up a pillow lay down on back with head upon coolness eased throbbing of wound a lay thought over position case be very bad one said to certainly be not going to turn traitor need be thought of have doubt that threat of shooting if refuse will be carried into execution question be whether will be carried out at once on refusal put off till to morrow morning surely will give twelve hour if there be end of there be possibility whatever of escaping in daylight know that there be much chance at night there may be chance at rate have day to think over lay there for hour sitting up occasionally to pour more water upon pillow throbbing of head subsided somewhat at one o'clock sat up forced to eat escape escape said must keep up strength when have finished meal stood up head still throbbed though pain be much le acute first went to door examined hinge be strong rough lock be sunk in woodwork be evident that must not be forced now said to have option of trying to get screw out of hinge cutting round lock felt in pocket for knife gave exclamation of disappointment when found that be gone be bitter blow spent time looking about floor in hope of finding piece of iron must use for getting out screw although searched place most carefully must find nothing must serve purpose wall of hut be far too solid to admit of making way through might thought be just possible to burrow under quickly dismissed idea for there be great depth of soil on rock be almost certain that foundation of wall must be carried down to went to one of little window stood there gazing out vaguely presently saw old woman come out of nearest house cut vegetable go in again wondered what be what be going to have for dinner hardly knowing what current thought be taking a roused looked round fresh idea struck wall must not be attacked door must defy effort that must make floor be altogether unpromising there be roof new hope sprung up in breast a looked up roof be simply composed of slab of stone although have be roughly plastered line where one have be laid on showed clearly slab be from inch to inch half thick about two foot square wall of cabin be about eight foot high arthur must just touch lowest range of slab with tip of finger saw at once that material within hut must enable to reach easily there be rough stool two foot high one of leg be gone by propping against wall must stand placed there mounted upon be bit shaky held weight top of head be now few inch below slab have doubt that must raise two sentry a far a must tell be in front of cabin considering structure be very improbable that there be one behind thus then if gave until next morning must well hope to make escape be so delighted at that hardly felt longer pain in head must of course be very easy matter to make way down through carlist line a have done before might well hope to do again at rate said to nothing can be done till night may a well sleep till then laid down again time going to sleep so soundly that did not hear guard come in put more food down about six o'clock awoke at once took meal hour later colonel again came in well sir what be answer said like to turn traitor said certainly have reason to be very grateful to christinos if offer be must resign service must certainly accept like to fight against old comrade must not be called upon to do so colonel said must be attached to one of other army have have good many deserter from line can not utilize because understand so little spanish basque want officer to lead there be plenty to make strong company will promise that will have command will not be employed here give till to morrow to think over sir have already taken one of officer may ask what reply gave obstinate fool chose death officer said be sorry of course have to be done trust that will not be so foolish at rate will give till to morrow morning unless be by time prepared to accept offer fate will be same a so saying left hut thankful for respite arthur went to one of little window looked out number of fire be burning carlist soldier be gathered round cooking food others smoking talking hour passed slowly arthur waited to choose time when camp be growing quiet when there be still sound might deaden noise might make at last moment arrived when thought must attempt to get stone off though did not intend to try to escape till be asleep placed stool against wall again climbed up then pushed with strength under one of slab gave little tried again yielded working very carefully got upper end out from underneath slab above then raised turned sideways lowered into hut talk of guard outside went on uninterruptedly be evident that sound have reached ear arthur sat down waited hitherto have felt no nervousness anxiety now became intense one of guard might enter place there be special ground for fear that must happen a hitherto sentry have only opened door to bring in meal still might do so again soldier who have be chatting with comrade at one fire might move off to sleep at notice hole caused by removal of slab be certainly very improbable on so dark night still thought of possibility of one other of two event taking place kept arthur nerve on strain at last everything seemed quiet night be perfectly still save that must hear occasional sound of talking laughter in trench lower down hill where doubtless considerable number of carlists must remain on watch at last felt that moment have come for making attempt again leant stool against wall put hand on edge of two slab by side of hole pulled up very noiselessly raised higher higher till must get leg over wall then turned lowered by arm dropped a did so rolled over with difficulty refrained from uttering groan instead of dropping a have expected on even ground one of foot have come on rough stone lying against wall in fall have badly wrenched ankle illustration began to drag along did not attempt to move for time chance of passing down through carlist line be at end for fully ten minute lay there then mind be made up turning over on to face began to drag along towards house have be looking at during day be only chance if must conceal there might be safe when escape be discovered in morning must be supposed that have made way down through line have gone out through rear of camp taken to mountain until must work way back to town there must certainly be search for close to prison took nearly hour at slow rate of progression to make way to house when reached raised on to sound foot noiselessly lifted latch went in closed door behind sat down against knowing nothing of interior arrangement dared not move for fear of waking inmate therefore remained there motionless dozing occasionally until first dawn of day enabled to obtain idea of surroundings room in be be unoccupied open door at back showed where old woman might live with be sleeping rough ladder in opposite corner of room led up to open trap door leading evidently to loft be what have hoped for making way across to pulled up ladder found a expected that be in low loft be half filled with hay faggot climbing over laid down behind lay listening in hour heard cry of alarm followed by great hubbub in camp have doubt that escape have be discovered presently heard stir below listening made out two voice one be have doubt that of old woman whom have seen other apparently that of old man probably husband have taken long draught of water last thing before leaving hut have put remains of food in pocket now bandaged ankle a well a must then slept greater part of day beyond quiet voice below heard nothing showed that suspicion existed that be hidden so close be troubled only by heat during day suffered good deal from at daybreak next morning made way to trap door looked down on table large jug of water loaf be standing crawled down ladder took returned to hiding place hour later heard angry talk below did not understand basque one of most difficult language to acquire guessed that owner be railing over loss of jug bread doubtless putting down to soldier who have entered after have gone to sleep stolen loss must not have be heavy one old couple did not get over day continued to grumble at interval to proceeds of theft be invaluable be able to keep bandage round ankle bathed with cold water calculated that bread must with care last three day that water must hold out a long proved to be case old man came up once during time with large bowl filled out of sack containing lentil otherwise arthur be altogether undisturbed at end of time pain in ankle have abated must feel that be still very weak that dared not yet attempt to walk on night went down refilled jug from pail carried off loaf of bread from cupboard after possessing of thing very carefully drew back bolt of door when old couple awoke heard engaged in furious quarrel have missed bread finding door unbolted old woman have charged husband with neglecting to fasten while be stoutly maintaining that have done so that saw do quarrel lasted with more le acerbity whole day have arthur possessed money must have placed copper coin two on table to pay for bread have taken pocket have be turned inside out by captor be absolutely penniless loaf lasted for four day when be finished determined that although ankle be still very weak must attempt to get away be very reluctant to again help from old people store might be at least three day before must enter town although hoped to be able to accomplish in one still if foot must give trouble might have to lie up in shelter however contented with only taking loaf at eleven o'clock at night when everything be quiet opened door went cautiously out object be to get down to urumea be mile half off so going back from brow of hill to avoid falling in with sleeping carlists started have gone short way when felt foot beginning to pain badly at first tried hopping found that jar of jump hurt a much a if be using foot a have knife must not cut stick therefore sat down swung along on hand be slow method of progression have to stop frequently to rest arm wrist soon gave up idea of being able a have hoped to reach river to swim down past carlist line before morning kept on however till dawn have begun to break by time must not be more than quarter of mile from river crawling into thick clump of bush lay down being thoroughly tired out with exertion slept till mid day when awoke ate large hunch of bread then waited until became dark enough for to make move a soon a night fell set off took nearly hour to cross quarter mile of broken ground at length to satisfaction bush ceased saw river twenty yard in front of have soon after starting from cottage taken boot off injured foot tied to waist now took off other fastened by fellow then stepped into river found to satisfaction that tide be running out have not be so must have sat down waited until ebb began after wading for little distance struck out for centre of river then turned on back let drift turning occasionally on to breast striking out carefully for time so a to get change of position luckily water be quite warm presently heard sound of talking perceived glow of light on stream swam across close to other shore saw a floated down fire of carlists stretching in zigzag line along entrenchment rising one above be confident that plainly a must see everything there sharpest eye must not discover so far beyond circle of light still did not attempt to swim until be well beyond fire then in quarter of hour knew that must be within line of legion thought however that must save trouble if be to land abreast of town so swam on until reached bridge have be thrown across river then went ashore having be about two hour in water water appeared to have benefited ankle for found that must now limp along slowly making way to quarter went quietly up to room opened door candle be burning there roper be sitting at table with head in hand looked up a arthur entered then sprang to foot with shout of joy thank god be back thank god have never quite given up sir although everyone else have evening when have be off duty have come sat here a knew that when came back must be after dark be glad indeed to see roper have have very narrow squeak time never want to have a narrow will tell about presently clothes be wet sir yes must change at once when have done that must go up to colonel report return sprained one of ankle can only just hobble along want to put more strain on than can help so when be undressed will turn in by way think before go off might cook something if there be anything to be have there be nothing

length by jove have done wonderfully well colonel said have be one of narrowest touch ever heard of if have sprained foot must have be back among within twenty four hour of capture be lucky indeed

in to help arthur to dress to make breakfast for arthur servant have be killed in last fight since time roper have whenever be off duty installed in place after breakfast brought arthur horse round latter mounted rode to colonel quarter that officer horse be at door came out at once before arthur have dismounted get off hallett said dr spendlow have be round here since left said that must on

fellow died hero death what terrible war be war to knife indeed seems to more cruel pitiless month in spite of effort colonel wylde british commissioner be making to persuade party to desist from atrocity be afraid that one side be almost a bad a other declare that commit murder by way of reprisal be bound to say that in early stage of war christinos be nearly a bad if not a bad a carlists since then however have be somewhat better have really tried think to keep convention to respect rule of war to spare prisoner have be true shot great many have be by way of reprisal for brutality of carlists especially of of cabrera who have several time shot woman a well a men now for story mr hallett arthur again told story at length compliment highly on quick wittedness mr hallett certainly

buried with military honour only received appointment a assistant on day before leaving beyond fact be to remain here to assist generally in acting a general evans representative know nothing of duty considering importance of mission absolute necessity that money will be sent without delay have ventured to ask that will introduce in first place to two minister to whom bring letter if will a far a can support application will gladly do so captain hallett indeed be duty to aid be not charged in way to interfere with spanish legion incidentally anything be of importance to general cause must of course be of interest to government may at present be called benevolent neutral be well aware that general evans have sent repeated application practically result have come of will therefore not only go with a ask will myself urge upon importance of application pointing out that by refusing necessary mean to general evans be in fact breaking term upon legion be raised that being so general must be acting with perfect propriety in withdrawing troop from field giving permission to who may choose to leave at once must of course mean complete break up of legion will not wish that be humiliating for spanish to be forced to hire foreign soldier to assist doubt that feeling have driven to treat legion very badly at same time have be continually in want of money considerable proportion of country be in arm against resource have be greatly diminished in consequence however after be excuse for offered certain term to men to fight for bargain must have be kept be same in peninsular war went to fight battle threw impediment in way starved men when have superabundance of supply so created hatred far greater than men felt for french be behaving in exactly same way now so far a troop be concerned there be one broad difference in first war fought partly at rate from feeling of patriotism whereas in present case although few may have gone into from feeling of sympathy for little queen great proportion of legion be more le than mercenary must have enlisted a readily for don carlos a for isabella now sir will go across to war office with have many time urged that step must be taken to relieve necessity of troop be not at sorry that general evans have at last put foot down be short walk across square for hotel faced war office on colonel wylde sending in name be at once admitted well colonel wylde what can do for minister said cheerfully have brought across to present to senor captain hallett who have just arrived from san sebastian with very important letter from general evans be accompanied by officer senior to latter be killed by party of carlists a came along minister looked sharply up at arthur who bowing handed letter begged to be seated opened communication frowned heavily then with very evident effort recovered matter will be seen to said know colonel wylde how straitened resource be that nothing must please more than to comply with general evans request one can grieve more than do at delay have taken place in complying with requisition sir arthur said spanish troop be always well fed though may be that pay be sometimes in arrears troop get food pay be in rag many of be barefoot single promise have be made to since day landed have be kept nearly third of number have died of fever brought on by cold want yet in spite of have be ready to fight while so many of own general have held back think be bold sir be urging cause of five thousand of countryman who have confiding in spanish honour come out here to fight battle if must go look at sir see condition must pity must marvel that have so long shown patience feed pay can be depended upon to carry out share of agreement assuredly can not be depended upon if be starved be not surprised sir colonel wylde said that general evans feel that more can be done officer have be now nine month without pay soldier six month more than third of number have died be invalided home heavy list of killed wounded in battle speaks for of bravery with fought must say that approve of general evans decision owes to men who serve under can not say that treatment have received have be grave scandal dishonour to government of spain have be four time to madrid to urge claim absolutely nothing have be done consider that general evans will be amply justified in carrying out threat matter will be seen to at once minister said with air of frankness will consult colleague minister of finance will see money be forwarded very shortly can assure general senor said to arthur that step will be taken to comply with request without delay will send message to effect own order be to remain here until treasure have be sent off that even when be done be to stay here a general representative to convey wish personally to until at rate arrears of pay have be cleared off be not favour that be demanding right will do honour of calling upon day two to ascertain when convoy with treasure will start of course can refuse admittance general evans will know what mean after few more word colonel wylde arthur left ministry spoke out straight british commissioner said with smile must not help doing so sir state of men be pitiful in extreme be scarecrow have practically uniform save greatcoat be in rag must have liked to take little man by neck shake be in bad way colonel said court be perfect nest of intrigue there be something like dozen party with own nominee to push own interest to serve large sum be wrung from people be for most part absolutely wasted in jobbery if be not that british government have taken part of isabella must recommend to stand aside altogether let faction fight out there be few honest men on side carlists indeed know what be fighting for to other side be matter of indifference who win provided can feather nest be not fighting for poor little queen for own private interest well know good many people here now will have much pleasure in introducing to house making thing pleasant for for be evident that if a say have to stay here until arrears of pay be received by legion will assuredly wait for indefinite time be going to reception evening at half past nine will be very glad to present there if will call for ten minute earlier thank very much sir must be very glad to make acquaintance of of people soon after return to hotel roper came up have seen horse fed sir what be next job next thing will be to get meal roper be going to do same oh have done that sir be best meal have have for time may say since left england well sha' want more at present so must advise to take turn round of soldier be sure to get into conversation with a be likely to be here for time be just a well that must make friend know enough spanish to get on with expect little will go long way be there chance of getting money sir expect will get now that spaniard see that have got to do something let troop go home will pay up enough to keep quiet for time suppose will be much sufficient to keep wolf from door at rate well sir will mind if go out in mufti picked up for few shilling clothes belonging to spaniard who died before came away be respectable sort of clothes thought if be going to stop here that must let wear in uniform must be sort of show everyone must be wondering who be certainly if like roper think be very sensible idea must be able to stroll about in without attracting attention at same time know must not be able to make friend with soldier oh will get into talk with sir glass of aguardiente will go long way with chap of course will let know that be soldier yes roper there will be advantage that with in plain clothes can walk about with will be good deal more pleasant for of so if will change thing while be at dinner can take turn together afterwards thank sir must like very much be biggish town will feel quite lost in for bit few minute later bell of table d'hote rang arthur went down to table be full speedily became engaged in talk with people sitting next to who be much interested on finding that be british officer asked many question a to state of thing in north about there be sort of contradictory report on part learned something for heard that be generally expected that cordova be going to be made war minister after dinner two three officer came up spoke to when heard that be on general evans staff said that must be glad if must smoke cigar with answered however that be engaged for evening must be very glad to do so on other occasion then went down joined roper who be standing at door of hotel walked about with for couple of hour what hand chap be for cloak latter said in north used to think that wore to hide shabby clothes ca be same here there be cold feel about air must not be sorry to have on one myself be evidently time stroll about most square looked quite empty morning now be full of people walking up down well roper must be off for be going a told with colonel wylde be large house room be very full when entered colonel at once took arthur up to hostess introduced what be news from front captain hallett asked there have be nothing doing for past month answered san sebastian be very full carlists look at from distance look at then passed on a guest came up colonel wylde introduced to several lady gentleman then left to talk with personage who be evidently of importance there be dancing going on refreshment served be of lightest description be change indeed to arthur said seems to be world almost to say that have be living roughly must be faint idea of state of thing how be thing getting on up there be dull work except when there be fight know nothing whatever of what pass elsewhere be officer a young a be madam have be exceptionally fortunate owe promotion largely to fact have since landed spent spare time in learning spanish speak very well captain hallett speak well enough for practical purpose senora must speak better still if be not that language up in north differs very widely from spoken here several card be left on following day for arthur in majority of case mentioned day owner received visitor on second day called on minister of war be told by possible effort be being made that hoped in few day to send off portion at least of sum due arthur then wrote despatch to general evans telling of major hawkins death relating interview with minister think said that money will be sent anticipate that sum be likely to be exceedingly small from what hear believe that government be really very short of money minister be evidently much alarmed at threat to disband legion will make effort to induce to alter determination will endeavour to see other day will continually repeat assurance that be in earnest on subject colonel wylde be also using effort in same direction have be very kind to introduced to many people be three week however before month pay be despatched with promise more must speedily follow by time arthur have become quite at home in madrid knew many officer to speak to of belonged to garrison others seemed to have good cause for being there kept up pretence of being engaged on important business one of said to one day seem very united family do not yes one must dream from appearance of madrid that civil war be going on yet society be split up into number of section working secretly against others outwardly there be sign of everyone go to reception look smiling pleasant practically everyone doubt everyone else there be number of well known carlists hold tongue at rate in public rub shoulder with men whom must gladly kill be funny when be able to look behind scene little have doubt will be able to do so before long saw chatting for example with senor durango very nice young fellow there be doubt that family be carlists be well connected have plenty of friend among christinos believe two third of people meet care snap party win if be here of course profess to be christinos if be away in province hold correspondence with carlists that may keep safe whichever side win altogether consider that carlists be more in christinos be more numerous simply because hold capital government if carlists be to gain one great success must be other way be game of self interest don carlos christina be merely counter want government others title others post in ministry others command there be nothing real about from beginning to end except for poor devil of soldier who have to fight will see that in short time cordova will retire espartero will probably take command must be certainly welcome to army be fine fellow if be allowed must be able to do great thing must sooner be appointed than dead set must be made at must be hampered in way well must be going dare say be wondering what be motive in staying here well be trying to get command of regiment regiment if possible stationed here in capital adieu throwing cloak over shoulder sauntered away arthur sat time thinking well if legion break up expect will do before long think will stay out here if take lodging live quietly can do on one hundred twenty pound year there will be lot to see probably end of fun have got eighty pound now so can little exceed allowance must certainly like to have fun again have have little enough goodness know since left england besides if be to go home now must have thrown away time have spent in getting up spanish be funny how take for at least five six twenty month pay have effect for short time troop be somewhat better off arthur have received letter from general evans thanking for obtaining small proportion of sum due urging to continue work then heard that there have be more fighting that irun have be captured by storm that several other town have be taken have surrendered two month later received letter from general saying that be going home that legion be about to be disbanded small body of about eight hundred men have agreed to remain here to form new legion may succeed for time have little doubt that will be treated in same way a have be however will be open for to join if be willing to do so can make way down to cadiz come home by ship from there enclose order on madrid for forty pound for fifteen pound for man have be lying in hand of paymaster here until must return must wish can have doubt enter christino army with present rank be something out of fire anyhow arthur said a put order into pocket book well if legion failed be not from want of pluck out of about six thousand have have over two hundred killed wounded officer over two thousand three hundred rank file so though have not achieved anything certainly need not be ashamed of fighting besides at least two thousand five hundred have died in hospital so that strength be accounted for roper shortly afterwards came in legion be disbanded roper be open to to go north embark with rest to go down to cadiz take passage home from there what be going to do sir be going to stay here in private capacity want to see end of thing will make head quarter will ride about see what go on know good many officer now can give letter of introduction to others a have fought for doubt will be well received in army at rate have wish to go home at present ca stay with sir must like to have with certainly ca afford to pay wage well sir food must not come to much like place like life above like being with must have someone to look after horse want to go home empty handed must certainly great deal rather not do so stop here if must keep must keep willingly enough roper only question be can must move out of lodging find smaller one one certainly must live cheaply enough here at cafe one seems to take anything coffee chocolate cup seems to last for hour from large number of people one meet at cafe see nowhere else must say that must dine at cheap place at home however will think over few day after arrival at madrid arthur have written home dear uncle will be surprised to see by heading of letter be at madrid first piece of news be that be now captain nominally upon staff of general evans actually on detached duty duty be likely to keep here for time in fact until legion be disbanded therefore need feel further anxiety a to safety be here to endeavour to worry government into sending store pay for legion to end call upon minister of war few day first time saw since then have always be too busy have also called upon prime minister have spoken to with what considered indecent warmth expect to do much good in future however here be be at present in hotel food be good bed be soft have with good friend roper of whom have spoken to in almost letter have written when good fellow found that be coming here threw up sergeant stripe to accompany a servant be great comfort having with have be made member of principal club here have already made several acquaintance so have doubt that will have pleasant time be not going to tell about madrid because can if choose find much better description of in book than can give please send next remittance will probably be last to mercantile house here will be glad to hear that though failed in getting arrears of pay for legion have be informed that can draw monthly for pay due to while here a living at hotel be not dear allowance will suffice very well for requirement have seen colonel wylde british commissioner who be very charming man of course have be doing very best can for legion be very frequently away with army will explain how be that be in charge here on mission of real importance major hawkins who be chief of mission be killed in skirmish with carlists that have on way down be very nice fellow be very sorry at death of course know yet whether will send field officer to take place leave in charge rather hope wo send one think must be wrong to leave to for cheek be very useful in sort of work flatter that will stir up good deal more than older man must be likely to do certainly will not be inclined to take 'no for answer will write shortly again with love to affectionate nephew chapter viii desperate adventure a roper desire to stay with arthur remained unchanged latter gladly accepted offer one of horse be at once sold removed into smaller lodging consisting only of tiny kitchen one sitting room with fold up bed in corner closet just large enough to hold bed for roper arthur be obliged to buy suit of dress clothes white shirt two suit of ordinary clothes lived on term of perfect equality when indoors except roper carried out simple cooking at breakfast supper while in middle of day went to quiet trattoria in suburb after week experience arthur found to satisfaction that even with hire of stable horse forage be living well within income there be of course surprise among acquaintance at substitution of civilian clothes for uniform made difference however in cordiality of reception for have become by time popular character especially with lady who appreciated frank boyishness freedom from formality so unusual among own people colonel wylde have taken great fancy to lad said to one day have be thinking over case hallett of course be not empowered to offer specific position be permitted to despatch messenger to point where may be unable to go wrote month since to say that operation be being carried on over so wide field found impossible to give attention to point stated that english officer named captain hallett have come down here a general evans agent be now unemployed must be convinced prove valuable assistant asked that might be permitted to appoint a aide with same rank a held under general evans in legion said that be well mounted that expense must be so very slight that strongly recommended appointment a be sure must gladly act under without extra appointment except pay of rank forage allowance for horse other usual field allowance will altogether make pay about one pound day have to day received reply authorizing appointment with rank of captain in army be indeed obliged to colonel arthur exclaimed in delight must most gladly have placed under order even without pay though say that will not be acceptable must not get work must like better can not tell how much be obliged to feel that spoke for a well a for captain hallett be impossible for to keep eye everywhere will in fact double utility there be only two other commissioner out here number altogether insufficient to cope with be going on indeed very many regrettable thing occur owing to want of supervision when one other of happens to be present can insist upon article of convention brought about between party being observed if be not there great deal of shooting in cold blood still take place will of course have to provide with undress staff uniform can send tailor here to see mine must not do for to use own be known to be christino one a may have to go into enemy line must therefore be easily recognized a one of have better get high boot breech of course cocked hat will not cost anything like so much a must at home people work much more cheaply here by way have larger stable than require so may a well keep horse there suppose may put man into uniform too sir be more convenient must look better yes think so own two orderly belong to th dragoon if like will accept a recruit in corp put on pay sheet must get uniform with renewed thanks arthur took leave hurried back to room have great news roper said colonel wylde have obtained permission for to act a assistant be to enlist in th dragoon guard so a to ride with in uniform so can shift out of little lodging again need look upon penny before spend be good news indeed roper exclaimed will be more useful to now for during past four month have learned to talk spanish quite well from having be so much in barrack with soldier well in first place have to be measured for uniform be to send tailor to colonel wylde to see pattern then will look out for lodging two horse be to be taken to colonel stable so that will save expense whole thing be entirely doing be tremendously obliged to three day later arrangement be completed comfortable lodging be taken have shifted into uniform have come home be found satisfactory arthur have reported a ready for service will be going up to north again colonel said when do so have better start out for east war be being conducted with great ferocity there be much to be desired that convention agreed to last year will be enforced at rate that effort must be made to enforce cabrera be brave skilful commander cruelty be abominable be always cruel atrocious action of nogueras in causing mother to be seized shot have closed heart to feeling of mercy shoot woman who fall into hand a well a men on one occasion shot fewer than eighty five sergeant in cold blood fear greatly that remonstrance must be of avail with man who seems to revel in bloodshed say that have not have terrible provocation if be to get hold of nogueras must not blame if cut into small piece think therefore that will be of use trying to influence may however attempt to persuade various christino chief in aragon valencia know that position be difficult be urged by friend relative of men murdered by carlists to make terrible reprisal when get opportunity in consequence war be becoming one of extermination have hope that will be able to do much can at least try will be glad to be able to report even in one two instance effort have be made by christinos to mitigate horror of struggle next day arthur again wrote home dear uncle have wonderfully good piece of news to give told in last letter now legion be disbanded intended to stay here for time on allowance saving now be changed for colonel wylde have obtained for appointment of assistant british commissioner with temporary rank of captain in majesty service be that splendid there be excellent pay allowance so will be able to live like fighting cock will be head quarter will generally be with one other of army in field will be know satisfaction to will not be called upon to take part in fighting will be merely spectator of fray now even will think that be not doing wrong in staying in spain be very much at home here have many friend acquaintance for know by time speak spanish really like native family be most intimate with be that of count leon de balen be young man of about five twenty with three young sister eldest of whom be about age of sixteen leon have be in england speaks english fairly be very english in way doe keep sister bottled up a most of spaniard do visit there just a must at english house where be intimate roper be of course with have be nominally enlisted in english dragoon regiment wear uniform be having english staff uniform made for be here must see swaggering down street a if belonged to really feel a if be somebody hope to hear that be pleased that even agree must not possibly do better for myself than remain here till end of war how long will be goodness only know will be in hurry for be just life of others to suit love to affectionate nephew in due time answer arrived dear arthur be delighted at receipt of letter must of course be extremely glad to have back with at same time can not recognize that must not do better for yourself than be doing know personally be extraordinarily gratified that must be holding commission a captain in majesty service a assistant british commissioner in spain be bound to say that aunt cousin seem to be filled with altogether excessive pride in position have gained girl have be going about among friend crowing like little gamecock even aunt ordinarily tranquil quietly disposed woman appears to be quite puffed up however joking aside be highly gratified certainly admit that be highly gratified too feel that must not do better for yourself than remain for three four year by time hope war will be finished will a say see what be going on without running serious risk when be in madrid can quite imagine that with official position will lead very pleasant life almost feel arthur that be getting altogether beyond advice be now able to go on own way can only say therefore that will be very glad to have back again with hope trace of unpleasantness necessarily resulted from last interview will be altogether forgotten affectionate uncle that evening arthur called at house of young count leon de balen be one of house at have become most intimate count have little of reserve hauteur common to most spanish noble have from first taken great fancy to arthur have made latter at time welcome to house have be one of first to have be invited after arrival at madrid be one of few be always open to have be taken to task several time young man said one day with laugh for inviting man man foreigner heretic so familiarly to house two year ago be for few mouth with embassy in london came to like way very much be very pleasant to be able to make call at house without ceremony made many friend seemed to in respect better for young people get to know other to like other young men young woman in country meet talk dance together be good friend without thinking of marriage whereas here girl be for most part shut up until marriage be arranged for of course hold a other people do that young lady must not go out alone must always be accompanied by duenna in own house under parent eye can see occasion for strictness might have hesitation in giving young spaniard general invitation to house because must not understand must think that wished to introduce a suitor to one of sister with englishman be different laugh talk with a if be own think be very good for that be a pleased to see a be when therefore arthur have other engagement very often went in for chat in evening to young count be naturally one of first told of new appointment congratulate most heartily leon said have be wondering since heard that legion have be disbanded what be going to do be leaving a told for one of country estate near albacete with mercedes will be away about couple of month if chance to be coming way need not say how glad will be to see of course know yet where be likely to go may a well be there a in other direction perhaps will be back a soon a will hope so sincerely on day when colonel wylde left for north arthur started for mercia when out of town called roper up to side be heartily glad to be at work again roper be not sorry sir have nothing to say against madrid one get tired of having nothing particular to do especially a for past three four day since have be in scarlet uniform everyone have stared at in street will get used to in time of course be rather trying at first dare say be arthur laughed of course feel so much there be not so much difference between officer uniform a between of private soldier at rate not between undress uniform be good deal more comfortable in present dress than be before for must not see that be getting very small have almost given up wearing yes keep on growing so be good bit taller than be when joined legion two year ago now be pretty nearly head taller must be over six foot now see little spaniard look up to a walk along yes have be rather disgusted at shooting up so suppose other people notice a be wanting to look six seven year older than be be annoying must keep on growing well think have pretty nearly done now travelled by comfortable stage down to mercia arthur have several interview with general in command of force there received assurance from care must be used to mitigate horror of war that passion of rage have be excited by massacre perpetrated by cabrera that be impossible to keep people in hand be to cabrera that must address senor general said be anxious to prosecute war in spirit of civilization a long a persists in carrying on like demon be plainly impossible for to fight in kid glove will go to cabrera arthur said even ought to have satisfied vengeance for murder of mother be in place must hunt nogueras through country until found be simply monstrous that must continue to take vengeance upon innocent people after remaining four day at mercia arthur therefore turned horse head north when neared albacete heard that cabrera have be making raid from sierra de val de meca have swept down nearly to city harassing country carrying off much booty arthur be told that cabrera have attacked taken palazzo of count de balen so hour after entering town rode out to enquire after friend a approached house saw smoke still rising from putting horse to gallop speedily arrived in front of house only however to find that be mere shell a arthur alighted man whom knew by sight came out from small outhouse what have happened be count sister safe ala sir man said carlists burst into house yesterday morning count opposed be struck down desperately wounded donna mercedes be carried off by sacked palace then set on fire three four of men be killed be away at albacete found that of woman have carried young count out behind house be in here arthur hurried in dear leon said be terrible news that hear terrible other said faintly be wounded badly be nothing except that will keep month before be fit to act be awful to think mercedes have fallen into hand of ruffian cabrera thank god have come know will do can for assuredly will in first place do know way villain have gone yes have gone up by la roda will doubtless sack that place minaya villar roblebo have fresh horse have driven horse off be unfortunate for made good long journey to albacete when arrived heard rumour that place have be sacked so rode straight here at rate must give horse four hour rest then will push on tell how happened be at breakfast yesterday when servant came running in with news that large body of horseman be coming up at gallop ran down with mercedes be already too late to get to horse rode up leader who be believe cabrera ordered men to seize sister drew sword be cut down almost before have struck blow knew nothing more until hour later when found lying here where seems female servant have brought saw that house be on fire from end to end that carlists have gone taken mercedes with think be nearly out of mind till then slept for hour overpowered by exhaustion found when awoke that monto have returned in evening have be sitting by night sent off at once to albacete returned at mid day with message from commandant there to effect that cabrera force be too strong to be attacked that expected to have to defend can not say that be surprised cabrera be so dreaded that requires strong man to attempt to make head against indeed when once got over fury recognized that a cabrera might be fifty mile away by time messenger got to albacete must be hopeless to attempt to pursue will set out a soon a horse have have rest fortunately have not be hurrying so far be in good condition will see cabrera will do in power to rescue sister fear journey will be useless wretch have become wild beast since murder of mother know will do can if be able to travel must go with must stab to heart if refused to release will be long before will be able to sit on horse again must think best thing can do leon be to have carried on litter to albacete where wound can be properly seen to so far have one woman to carry tell that whole of men be driven off estate made to enter cabrera rank well did not go much farther than there must be men to be have from of village few mile away will send man off at once to get dozen of to carry must want something to eat too will call one of woman in here what have to eat have got green corn senor of field set on fire be too green to burn caught chicken wandering about then cook for senor servant leon now lay for time without speaking have lost great deal of blood after departure of carlists before woman ventured to go near although have roused on arthur arrival be now too exhausted to talk further after stay of four hour arthur started again be already dark must have preferred waiting till daylight have not count anxiety be so great that thought must be better to go at rate for few mile after travelling for two hour arrived at farm old woman be only occupant a men have gone willingly enough with carlists house belonging have not be interfered with horse be put up in shed two men sat down by fire talking have very little hope of getting donna mercedes out of cabrera hand by fair mean be like asking tiger to give up kid great hope roper lie rather in rescuing myself of course know where be confined how be guarded be not likely that must place very strong guard over together ought to be able to get away of course can form plan until see place there will be risk in business ca be helped have got in out of bedroom at school many time can back to climb anywhere will be business to bring horse round in readiness when get out if can possibly get hold of third animal will be great advantage for will have to reckon upon being pursued be ready for anything captain count be always very civil to when called upon never came without making present doubt knew by lodging that thing be not very flourishing with be just sort of business must like have done fighting for past nine month will be right glad of skirmish expect will be something worse than skirmish if brute cabrera wo give young lady up will be serious job to take even if can get horse for good a ours may be be probable that there be better one in camp however be so vague at present that be useless to try form plan one thing be sure can say fewer than six wo take from once have got must not deceive ourselves that will respect uniform cabrera respect nothing if stand between vengeance need not flatter ourselves that will let go well sir man ca die better than in trying to save woman be how look at quite right roper be death of others must choose however have faith in ourselves fancy that will get through somehow though be pretty sure that will be very close shave think have better lie down till daybreak have given horse good feed have not yes sir have put down sack of bean between will be fresh enough in morning till yesterday have not travelled more than fifteen sixteen mile day have week rest at mercia must not be in better condition started a soon a began to be light on reaching la roda heard that cabrera have rested there on previous day have gone on morning to banada villar do navado on arriving at banada found that cabrera have ridden on hour before to villar de navado place reached at eleven o'clock place be full of carlists arthur alighted in front of principal house be looked at scowlingly by men thronging street nothing be said to wish to see general cabrera said will say that be one of british commissioner after being kept waiting for two three minute be asked in cabrera be powerful man with face full of strength energy to what be indebted for visit senor asked a arthur entered have called sir to implore to respect convention entered into between party signed by on part of british government by colonel wylde lacy have nothing to do with cabrera said christinos have committed great atrocity be intention to revenge whenever possible at least sir arthur said war against woman war against enemy men woman own mother be murdered by a doubt be aware for drop of blood will take vengeance sir lady whom carried off day before yesterday be not wife of christino general in way connected with war brother be well known christino cabrera replied enemy of don carlos be enemy be well that young noble at court must learn that by supporting government against king be a much foe a if be fighting in field make war in toy own way other general may do a like refuse to have hand tied intend to inflict heavy lesson upon politician of madrid against young woman have special quarrel a member of leading christino family be enemy a such will be shot to morrow morning there sir be useless to talk further mind be perfectly made up if wish to remain till morning to witness execution be perfectly at liberty to do so in fact must prefer for wish to be known that prisoner who fall into hand will be shown mercy arthur rose well sir in taking leave of beg in name of government to warn of consequence of making war in defiance not only of rule usage of humanity cabrera simply waved hand in scorn arthur turning strode out of room find place in outskirt of village put up horse said to roper there will talk with hut from inhabitant have fled on approach of carlists be soon found have brought good allowance of bean with have not yes sir have nearly sack give horse good feed then will talk matter over sat down on broken chair a expected roper villain be not to be turned from purpose lady be to be shot to morrow morning seems to that there be between three four thousand men in around village of a far a must see a rode in only hundred so be mounted may take that horse be better than average have not be doing such long march be really good animal know be best must fancy that if get fair start not above thirty will keep up with perhaps not above twenty be number may have to cope with first thing will have to find out be where donna mercedes be confined how be guarded be unlikely that will have placed more than two three sentry over must know well enough that must not escape by must say that there will be one sentry outside door perhaps two inside if there be door window at back of house need not bother about man in front must do for two men inside bring two horse round within hundred yard of back of house will drop out of window if there be one walk out of door first of must find out house then will be business to stroll round choose horse in position that can lead off without disturbing others must get behind side of street on house stand so that will not have to lead across street simply bring place with right sir think can answer for part of business suppose will not begin until half past ten eleven will be pretty nearly asleep by time sha' begin before waited for couple of hour then strolled out into village carlists knowing that have have interview with chief paid great attention to presently arthur seized opportunity of asking woman who be standing at door be priest house be last house in village on side of street senor arthur continued stroll to end of village then turned back walked to other end be heat of day now

room together arthur opened door let girl pas in then closed behind went down stair quarter of hour later servant came down said that count wished to see ah dear arthur leon exclaimed a entered how can thank enough for sister for that have done for seems restored to by miracle be not much of miracle leon required only little invention little pluck affair be managed felt that be very hard if must not get sister out of hand of scoundrel success can scarcely have afforded more pleasure than have roper be very well to say so fact be not changed have rescued from certain death have carried off from centre of four thousand men sister tell that did in disguise of priest yes good man gave assistance have not be ill paid said with light laugh for have got hold of two very valuable horse now will have to take care of other sister have be splendidly brave will need rest quiet for while must not have better thing to do than to look after will do good to be cared for by will wait here for couple of day for horse have have four long day work suppose have not seen anyone here yet no good many gentleman of acquaintance have left card doctor said be not to see anyone at present think will be nearly month before can move said morning that be afraid must get into high state of fever if agitated however have fear of now have done more good than doctor in spain must do now mercedes must lift head up from that pillow stop cry one must have be calmer cooler than sister be leon now that be over have found that be doing well must not be surprised at breaking down little can assure that from time entered room till rode fairly away be a quiet composed a possible in fact did not speak single word from moment lowered down from window till be able to put horse into canter to be just like school adventure be always getting into scrape at school master after master refused to keep be for reason enlisted in legion really seemed to same sort of thing only with little spice of danger pleasure satisfaction of doing good now donna mercedes if will take advice will go straight to bed will want strength to nurse brother have gone through frightful anxiety have made long very fatiguing journey before install at brother bedside want long rest if take will be breaking down badly see for that be doing well now that have got back again there be fear of having relapse can have slept little therefore trust that will at once lie down have good long rest that will do same then evening will be able to have quiet chat for couple of hour will be quite willing to take own prescription lie down till evening arthur be right leon said have gone through painful time will be more ourselves after sleep think have slept five minute at time since be attacked at rate must obey order be one o'clock now will meet here again at eight arthur at once went down stair found roper in stable having just fed horse now roper have better turn in at once have arranged for room for will not want anything more to day have better settle with one of stableman here to feed water horse evening will come down again sir later well can do if wake roper expect that when once shut eye wo open again till to morrow morning at rate can arrange that horse will be attended to if must not come down feel very uncertain about waking arthur gave order that must be roused at eight o'clock in very few minute be fast asleep must hardly believe that have be six hour asleep when there be knock at door however jumped out of bed washed a well a be able with very scanty supply of water deemed sufficient for ablution then went down to leon room look better leon said a entered feel better indeed have slept like dormouse did not wake till servant came in few minute ago doctor said be quite different man from what be morning feel ever so much better too must feel better still if must have have bath hope sister wo wake must be fresher for complete night rest told slept good deal on ride yes think dozed wonder must have have terrible time of poor girl be fearful position for quite expected that when got to must have found completely prostrated expect will get up know want to hear how have managed have told that have not asked anything appeared suddenly dressed a priest after have got away have felt so happy in being safe yet so bewildered at that have scarcely spoken at can quite understand feeling so can perfectly on ride to place must see that be thinking of nothing meeting think credited assurance that be not mortally wounded be yearning for sight of ah here be be looking better leon said a came up to bedside be feeling hundred per cent better doctor say that be quite different man whereas when saw morning did not feel at sure must get over have fear about now so see arthur have saved life well let say anything more about leon affair have turned out right there be more to be said on matter leon smiled be very well for be not quite so satisfactory to now must tell about for present only know that got priest to help in way want full particular well will tell whole story gave full account of event from moment of arrival in village must have given good deal said after describing scene with cabrera to have got scoundrel in quiet place by though be bound to say doubt whether must have be found better man fellow to do justice be uncommonly vigorous powerful might have discovered that have caught tartar be so furious with must willingly have taken chance of course can make allowance for man whose mother have be murdered in war can understand showing mercy to men of other party who may fall into hand to take revenge upon woman who have nothing whatever to do with wrong have suffered be monstrous must know by own feeling what friend must suffer however a be not to be moved felt must depend upon decided that only way to get at senora must be by assistance of priest at rate that be first plan to attempt then related interview with priest manner in latter have at once agreed to aid various step have taken to ascertain position of carlists lying about village to secure spare horse how have carried out plan be sorry said to have to kill one of men in hut must see other way of disposing of of before alarm must be given of course if have not be able to obtain priest disguise must have have to kill sentry at door too even then men inside might not have opened door to summons probably must not have done so still own that went desperately against grain to have to stab man be really only unpleasant part of business rest be simple donna mercedes be very brave very quiet roper have obtained accurate idea of where carlists be lying so that there be not single hitch in affair if have be for sister must have almost preferred chase excitement a be be of course very thankful that everything went so perfectly will take care leon said that priest be made comfortable for life can at rate show gratitude in quarter though must always remain in debt to what be going to do next be going to stop here for couple of day if can get good price for two of horse will sell will keep that one of cabrera be splendid animal think of others best be one belonged to major hawkins other two be good animal worth must say from thirty to forty pound apiece will give that for gladly of course cabrera people carried off mine must have two for riding back to madrid so will be really glad to take two off hand very well arthur said certainly did not want to saddle with a say really want must rather sell to than to anyone else then be settled will get mercedes to write to morrow for two of servant to come here men who accompanied be killed besides must get donna martha duenna maid to join to keep company must not be seemly for to be here alone while be laid up arthur laughed by way mercedes will have to write to don silvio telling what have gone through girl looked earnestly at brother made answer turned again to arthur did not say what be going to do hardly know instruction be to go to mercia see governor there to endeavour to impress upon importance of observing convention strictly be not altogether successful repeated desire to do so pointed out to that cabrera so persistently refused to observe in way committed such atrocity that people be roused beyond control however much therefore might wish to carry on war humanely public opinion be too strong for friend of people murdered by cabrera naturally clamoured for reprisal be intention when arrived to proceed to cabrera camp endeavour to persuade to carry on war ruthlessly well have be to see remonstrance be not of slightest avail will now go to madrid request minister of war to send formal despatch to calling upon to conduct war more humanely saying that unless doe so all follower who fall into hand of royal troop must be put to sword however painful must be to to give order to effect suppose communication must influence in way might influence follower who can scarcely like to fight with a be halter round neck be extraordinary to that people of one nation must fight so ferociously must refuse quarter to other against foreign invader one can imagine spirit a for example when be invaded by french that people of one blood must on mere difference of opinion a to who must be king hate other so venomously beat altogether can not give reason for leon said be in favour of christina must not mind doing little fighting though a be not soldier feel called upon to take up arm still seems to that matter might be a well settled by everyone giving vote one way other minority then yielding gracefully chatted for time conversation being principally kept up by arthur mercedes scarcely opened lip sat by brother side holding hand at ten o'clock nurse came in said that must now be quiet for night others again went off to room after breakfasting by arthur went down to stable have sold two horse to count leon yes so have be telling oh have seen have yes sir sent down for hour ago look deal better than when left three day back yes will do now have lost lot of blood will be time before gain strength again doctor said yesterday that have fear whatever a to getting through well have quite taken away breath morning have in what way well sir have told that when get to madrid will make present of five hundred pound be glad indeed to hear roper have done enormous service at good deal of risk have always understood that be wealthy young noble have doubt can very well afford to do told sir that really have nothing to do with that have simply done what have ordered never having seen young lady must not allow that made difference have assisted in saving sister life be very pleased to be able to make such acknowledgment of service must not mind how many lady life saved on such term well be heartily glad roper always have be source of annoyance to be not able to do more for when have be such friend together be right sir be friend together for time be in right position be not that of course be soon put right have stood ever since in proper relation towards other be only too glad to work for now have put in for very good thing if be to go home now everyone must say that have done mightily well for must go in for farming again made mistake in leaving well when get home roper will see that have first farm be vacant on estate why did not know that have estate roper said in surprise yes have estate believe pretty good one be not to come into till be five twenty think father saw be harum scarum sort of chap so settled in way though be not to come in for till be twenty five have uncle who manages for can certainly persuade to give first farm be vacant have intended to do so before thought there might be difficulty about because must require capital to work five hundred pound must give fair start on small farm must be splendid sir will give something to look forward to a long a stay out here will stay with if be for ten year make difference having something to look forward to afterwards for have wondered sometimes what on earth must do when went back again must feel so strange have thought too sometimes about what must do when affair have come to end well be a glad to know that will be all right a be about arthur went upstairs a entered room mercedes got up from brother bedside went out be little upset arthur leon said be what be matter be not feeling worse hope no be nothing about myself be about mercedes know that three month ago be betrothed not formally know matter be arranged to count silvio de mora be suitable match in respect be fourteen year older than mercedes worthy cavalier of course asked hand of gave consent offered more objection than well brought up maiden must do now turn round tell that have resolved not to marry after being so near to death saved a by miracle be resolved to live single doe not wish to enter convent anything of sort at rate to live single for year in fact until marry then will probably go into religious house well seems so unnatural because have always have very high spirit be fond of gaiety have asked to think matter over declares that nothing can influence implores to let have own way can understand feeling of course be greatly shaken by what have gone through hope though in time will recover spirit have declared that nothing will move after such terrible experience a have have feel that at present at rate must let have own way can not hold pen yet will be greatly obliged if will write in name to count thought of engagement evidently prey upon mind say did not sleep night see that will have peace until carry out wish of course will do a wish leon will write from dictation seems to natural poor girl that must be terribly shaken by what have gone through chapter x good service letter took time to write began with account of attack upon chateau manner in count servant be struck down donna mercedes carried off then described how cabrera have sentenced to be shot how few hour before sentence must be carried out be rescued by captain hallett brought safely to albacete where count be lying wounded sister be greatly prostrated by terrible trial that have passed through considers that have be preserved by miracle that must dedicate life to good work have expressed to dear count irresistible repugnance to plan have formed have implored to ask to relieve from engagement to have argued with in vain beg of not to take amiss must ask to release be profoundly shaken will not be sure for long time be fit to be at head of establishment like yours indeed a have said talk of entering religious house trust dear count that unfortunate circumstance will not cause breach in friendship long established good feeling between family with assurance of deep regret at severance of tie to have looked forward of regard appreciation sign yours most cordially here leon took pen in own hand feebly added signature between ourselves said be not altogether sorry that engagement be broken off have great esteem for don silvio be not sure that mercedes be quite suited to other be somewhat grave be in thick of politics fancy mercedes have little resented small share of attention have paid however undoubtedly affair must have gone on in usual course have not be for matter arthur took departure on following day seemed to that donna mercedes shunned brother room while be there thought natural that must be embarrassed by feeling that owed so much to that a letter have written for leon showed must be profoundly affected by event through have passed be too natural that must desire to be alone with brother a at present be without maid companion must of course wish to act a nurse therefore said good bye to in evening a intended to start early hope will see in course of month so leon said yes hope so trust donna mercedes that will be looking more will have shaken off effect of trial have gone through girl put hand in looked a if must have spoken be evidently too much moved for word so turned left must hardly have thought that must have felt so much said to a went up to room though of course have be most terrible trial what with anxiety about brother however hope will soon shake off know have plenty of spirit nothing must have be more plucky than way in behaved until be fairly away from prison doubt feel more now that be over have nothing to keep up for wonder how count will take breaking off engagement be not sorry have done be extremely courteous suppose attentive be always formal did not seem to to really care for not that know anything of such matter still think that if be engaged to extremely nice girl must not content with pressing tip of finger however may be spanish custom how cousin must have laughed if have treated in ceremonious sort of way be nearly month before arthur returned to madrid for be with christinos when be defeated by cabrera with great loss near tortosa have taken no actual part in fight though have ridden with christino general a soon a saw that battle be lost rode away be quite evident roper said that christinos fight so well a carlists seem to be plucky too carlists fight with greater fury have much le discipline hurl upon foe with disregard for death that there be withstanding now fellow beat carlists at own game be equally ready to go at enemy have good deal more discipline be evidently useless for to remain here cabrera wo observe convention kill officer who fall into hand christinos must be quite willing to show mercy often get chance of doing so will go up to madrid report to colonel wylde who will dare say be back by time get there sha' be sorry sir for be not pleasant being with troop who always get licked seems to sir that carlists be likely to win in long run think so roper see will never remain long in field village be everywhere in mountain ca be kept together time for there be difficulty of provision rush down defeat avoid christinos collect considerable amount of spoil then go off to home again be sort of semi organized guerrilla although guerrilla can maintain warfare for long time must in long run be defeated have be fortunate in having wonderfully active leader first of have zumalacarreguy now have cabrera of whom have faculty of inspiring men with intense enthusiasm willingness to endure hardship of general have succeeded in introducing anything like discipline though splendid guerrilla chief be not men for moulding whole people into regular soldier two day after return to madrid arthur be delighted to see leon enter room still looked pale thin expression be bright cheerful well old paladin exclaimed here be well getting strong again have travelled by easy stage taken ten day to come from albacete be right felt sure that when have nothing to do eat drink must soon pick up again sister hope have recovered also partly not altogether hope have given up idea of becoming religieuse must be thousand pity if be to shut up in convent be sure must bitterly regret afterwards have have great shock of course effect will pas off in time must see that be great relief to when received answer from don silvio releasing from engagement be written in excellent language be really irreproachable in tone between think feeling be very deeply touched have certainly picked up faster since received broke down good deal when arrived to day have sister donna martha to cry over coddle wo ask to come to evening think have better be quiet what have be doing since left arthur gave account of journeying be thinking count said of raising two company from among tenant of estate near seville will not be happy until have crossed sword with fellow cabrera can understand see cabrera be not fellow to be found so easily be here to day gone to morrow strike blow in one place then two day afterwards fall upon column hundred mile away think leon if be must give up idea have everything that one can wish for be rich popular happy in family be very well for people who want pay position of general to go into army have nothing to gain by at rate a long a party hold own against carlists see that have business to put on uniform word say be a applicable to a be to be affair of yours doe matter snap of finger to whether don carlos christina reign in spain be true enough have got living to get like life excitement be well enough at present war be not going to last for ever if be must not remain out here have year to kill when be over will go home live on own land oh did know have land never told so leon be not given to talk about own private affair be wild a boy father thought be well that must not come into fortune until arrived at year of discretion very wisely tied up so that must not touch until then mean that will ever be great magnate a be will have very nice estate will be larger for having waited fifteen year for be very glad to hear very glad though doe seem to very hard that must be kept so long out of still be last who ought to complain for if have not be obliged to become sort of knight errant must have lost sister have anything to grumble at though do wish have remained at school couple of year longer finished education education leon laughed must have done with long ago be not so old a look arthur said well look a old a do anyhow be not so old by good many year wo tell how many for want to be treated like little boy think must do that if said that be only ten well can tell a great secret be more than ten well leon said getting up with laugh now must be off mercedes who have developed into regular tyrant only gave leave to come out on condition must not stop more than five minute if have be anybody must not have let come at not think even if queen regent have sent for be quite right leon though must like to keep here be sure that after riding in here morning ought not to have moved out again well will walk with back to own door arthur on calling on following morning be received with great enthusiasm by mercedes two younger sister with whom have become great favourite also by young count mercedes however seemed painfully shy with think will ever feel comfortable with again senor said with great effort feel quite overpowered with sense of what owe then senora will oblige to regret that ever interfered in behalf arthur said with smile sooner get that idea out of head sooner will feel comfortable again be great pleasure to to be of service to will take pleasure out of altogether if be going to be unnatural with ca help said then sha' rescue time when get into scrape once picked young cousin of mine out of water ice be thin have right to take on a scarcely ever did what be right took went through of course went in after be nearly drowned well did not hear last of for long time be always being thrown up in teeth till declared must never take girl out skating again now seems that be going to make just a disagreeable for girl laughed well will really try hard not to will tell that anyone else must have done just same a did that there be danger in that be altogether most commonplace affair good said that will make much more comfortable how old be cousin of yours two year younger than be be last time have bit of fun together aunt entertained idea be making girl into regular tomboy think ever went out with again afterwards be afraid be not so sorry a ought to have be at losing society for be getting to evil age when boy think girl rather nuisance what age may that be senor one of younger girl asked with laugh well in england think begin about fourteen last till about twenty oh then may flatter that will not regard a nuisance be very well behaved little girl expect to play with play with indeed girl said scornfully must think not why

hat courteously if passed in street unless be very very intimate must hardly think of speaking to even in house whereas actually laugh at make fun of have to laugh sometimes when think ought to be very indignant must practise looking indignant before glass senorina else be afraid must be failure must not be properly impressed now donna mercedes said turning to hope have found leon very good patient be very good first fortnight after that be by mean so easy to manage have very often to appeal to donna martha sometimes absolutely set at defiance at rate have done credit to nursing then settled down for quiet talk arthur heard how have at first travelled by very short stage have gradually increased length of journey be very tedious leon said must have come good deal faster if have be allowed now about suppose came back fortnight ago only came back day before changed mind went down to tortosa a heard that battle be imminent there to disgust saw christinos utterly routed by cabrera fortunately carlists be not strong in cavalry if have be royalist must have be entirely destroyed after chatting for time longer took leave in hour returned have just heard very bad news can assure be very serious know that don carlos completely defeated general buerens at herrera killing ninety two officer inflicting loss of two thousand six hundred men killed wounded prisoner espartero hurried up to rejoin oraa carlists affected to retreat really joined cabrera gave slip be morning within four league of madrid exclamation of dismay broke from hearer have troop here none urban guard who have just be called out must say must not stand hour before carlist attack moreover there be a know large number of carlist sympathizer who will be certain to rise a soon a attack wall then have better send lady off at once leon said rising to foot if leave other side of city may get away think must be safer for to stay here carlist cavalry may be round town in couple of hour might be cut off so that must certainly be safer here be true that cabrera be with don carlos will not be supreme a latter must be convinced restrain cruelty must know well enough that nothing must be worse for cause than for entry into capital to be marked by scene of bloodshed think greatest danger will be from rising of mob before carlists enter must strongly advise to arm men to barricade window not protected by bar prepare to beat off assault house be very strong solid mob must hardly be able to capture in face of firm resistance for may calculate that don carlos will enter town within hour at most after disturbance break out here will have done at once must certainly set about be scarcely likely that don carlos will be before town till to morrow morning will give ample time to make preparation how many men have with stableman have eighteen must be sufficient will help to set to work will then go out into town bring in latest news men be at once collected leon sent of out to buy crowbar set to work to get up paving stone in hall yard with to block up window on ground floor when have fairly begun arthur went out finding roper asked to saddle horse having done that rode out to see state of thing prevailing street be in uproar of people appeared almost out of mind with fear dreaded name of cabrera be on everyone lip large mob have assembled before head quarter of government with many gesture abused minister for leaving capital undefended others among crowd with difficulty concealed exultation many of public office be pelted with stone deputation of influential citizen went to palace have interview with christina who maintained firm countenance told that espartero with army be following hard on track of don carlos that city must at most have to resist for few hour presently there be rush to wall carlist cavalry must be seen galloping towards town arthur mounted horse followed by roper rode to gate towards horseman be approaching regiment of urban guard be drawn up here rode up to colonel who be personally known to colonel said may suggest to that if be to lead men outside must drive off carlist cavalry must not stand against infantry must probably ride off after short exchange of shot result must greatly raise spirit of townspeople perhaps lead to decide upon making resistance of course have not shadow of authority a one of british commissioner feel duty to point out to very great advantage of such step be ready to ride out with take share in fighting will do sir colonel answered see truth of what say addressed few word to men then ordering gate to be thrown open marched out leading regiment arthur riding beside cavalry be four hundred yard away a infantry marched out formed up in company opened fire upon horseman latter answered in straggling undetermined manner then in two three minute turned rode off congratulate senor arthur said think be quite probable that have saved capital trooper will carry back word that garrison be determined to resist be sure to cause hesitation in council of don carlos may feel certain that at least for to day nothing will be done hour pass will bring espartero nearer to assistance regiment be enthusiastically cheered a returned to city received great ovation a entered puerto del sol great square of town minister of war came down thanked colonel bestowed upon rank of general latter generously said that have acted in accordance with advice given by british commissioner that must not have thought of taking step for advice that british officer have ridden out with thereupon arthur who have when entered city gone off to lodging be sent for received formal thanks of minister incident seemed to greatly inspirit defender noisy crowd now dispersed preparation for defence be carried on vigorously after leaving ministry arthur went back to aid count in preparation already great deal have be done by evening house be placed in position to make stout defence against attack by undisciplined force in afternoon count went out for short time on return said to sister young lady will please salute hidalgo captain arthur hallett a saviour of city told have be out through gate with regiment went fired few shot at carlist cavalry now appears that be who advised officer in command of regiment to go out that gallantly rode with colonel at head for service have be publicly thanked by minister of war yes be ashamed of being thanked arthur said went to have look at carlist cavalry seeing regiment of infantry at gate suggested to colonel that must be good thing to go out drive off a even little thing like must tend to restore confidence so went out fired dozen volley carlists fired few shot in return made off there be beginning end of at rate arthur everyone at club agreed that have have great effect in restoring confidence crowd demonstrating in front of various ministry dispersed many of men who have absented from muster of company have now joined seems probable that if don carlos attack to morrow everyone supposes will do stout defence will be made well dare say may have have that effect leon be just what expected when suggested move be nonsense to make such fuss about be a much a must to laugh in minister face when talked about a very valiant business think seriously arthur that affair may have good deal of consequence probably cavalry be sent on to ascertain disposition of town see whether be likely to surrender without blow fact that little sortie be made will give idea that be prepared for desperate resistance everyone know that don carlos be man who can never quite make up mind several men at club agree in thinking that be quite possible may march away again without attempting anything if doe leon will be death blow to own cause by throwing espartero off track effecting junction with cabrera marching within striking distance of capital have got opportunity that will never have again ought to have attacked to day news that have captured madrid must have roused partisan to great enthusiasm brought doubter over to side whereas if throw away opportunity will disgust men who have come so far from home will certainly infuriate cabrera will show that be utterly unfit to be head of well nigh desperate cause night work of preparation went on cannon be got out of arsenal mounted in commanding position gate be blocked up with stone ammunition piled on wall whole population toiled at making preparation for defence in morning point from view over country must be obtained be thronged in anticipation of seeing enemy advancing to general delight plain seemed to be absolutely deserted very speedily party of mounted gentleman sallied out from one of gate rode out to reconnoitre country arthur went with rode to within two mile of carlist camp sign of movement be discernible watched for three hour at end of time saw royal tent around lowered hour later must make out whole army drawing off with exultant shout mounted rode back to city where news excited wild enthusiasm fickle crowd shouted applauded minister a furiously a have morning before denounced leon have to great disgust to abandon idea of joining party riding out have awaited at home return of arthur with news have gone arthur exclaimed a ran upstairs gone yes horse foot baggage exit don carlos count shouted yesterday literally have game in hand to day have thrown away there girl please make curtsy to don arthur have saved spain what ridiculous nonsense leon arthur said almost angrily be good sober sense not nonsense at don carlos have doubt be assured that have only to elude army in field show before madrid when town must open gate to authority come out to surrender capital fact that troop sallied out attacked cavalry have completely overthrown hope believe that town must have surrendered without resistance if have marched straight on yesterday to day must have fought must not have offered strong resistance wall be rotten carlist cannon must have made breach in in time in fact suppose must have troubled to do must have carried place by storm now chance have gone for ever for after fiasco will never be able to persuade mountaineer to make long march again may go on fighting for long time before thing be over will never see carlist army before madrid again call happy inspiration if like friend be happy inspiration saved christino cause hour later royal messenger came to house saying that on calling at english officer lodging be told that must probably find at count de balen that queen regent desired attendance at palace have led first last sortie arthur exclaimed in tone of despair a far a be concerned carlists may occupy madrid without moving from room to prevent be there ever fuss made over such ridiculous affair still suppose must go of course must go leon said be foolish arthur can insist on getting off being thanked by mercedes there be getting off being thanked by queen with shrug of shoulder arthur went down stair mounting horse rode by side of mounted messenger to palace here be at once escorted to apartment of queen regent number of minister be gathered there by side be little queen isabella child of between five six year old minister of war stepped forward taking arthur hand led up to two queen majesty said beg to present to captain arthur hallett one of britannic majesty commissioner have already have honour to inform that to be due that colonel now general de layer conceived idea of leading out on own responsibility regiment be on guard against carlist cavalry accompanied colonel at head of regiment drove off carlist cavalry with loss be doubtless largely due to proof of courage resolution of majesty troop that pretender abandoned idea of attacking town have marched away with force confession of defeat will undoubtedly have very desirable effect in establishing daughter on throne by animating faithful follower throughout country by dispiriting of don carlos illustration queen christina held out hand queen christina held out hand to arthur who not being sure of what be right thing to do knelt on one knee kissed give gentleman hand queen said to child have done very very great service child did a be told said thank think will like very much be told also captain hallett christina said that performed act of extreme valour be at present talk of court namely that went alone into camp of cabrera effected rescue from ruthless leader of sister of count leon de balen who have be condemned to death by act in stamp a officer of most distinguished bravery taking into consideration that act performed on behalf of sister of nobleman of court service have now performed for have pleasure in handing cross of first class of san fernando knight of isabella catholic thank majesty most deeply for honour have be pleased to bestow upon feel have done little indeed to deserve be for counsellor for to judge captain hallett said graciously trust that will see sometimes at court arthur then retired court chamberlain having placed round neck sash insignia of order suppose must wear thing said a went back be really too ridiculous say that action have not effect doubt have there be nothing in doing of have promised leon to return tell what queen said to went up to drawing room with rueful expression on face girl be still there with brother a entered with decoration clapped hand be very well for to applaud said make feel downright ridiculous if have done anything worth doing say must not feel gratified at honour for merely saying be come out fire few shot be absurd be be absurd arthur leon said laughing now please tell exactly what majesty said exactly well said that have done great service then that have heard also about rescue of donna mercedes for service performed for sister of nobleman of court for service done to herself bestowed honour upon be glad mercedes said in tone of delight must not let thank have be thanked by queen christina be pleased more than can say so be leon said shaking hand heartily with be very good of to say so leon arthur said in depressed tone say must value honour immensely if have really done exceptionally brave thing thank goodness will only have to wear ribbon star on very special occasion yes will always have to wear rosette must remember that in country be now cavalier arthur hallett with right of entry to royal court at time many other privilege concerning will make enquiry inform arthur laughed uneasily be very well for to joke about leon can assure that find rather heavy infliction must not leon said earnestly be real honour let tell high one to be special very great pleasure that service did have be considered in bestowal of upon well wo grumble more will specially regard a souvenir of service be enabled to render to sister will be one of greatest pleasure to remember life be well spoken leon said like can assure that be immense pleasure to that although be powerless to show gratitude owe action have be recognized by queen now leon arthur said to turn conversation have work of putting down pavement again yes a think will hear don carlos knocking at door again have already set men to work will soon have thing tidy once more well now will be going leon well forget that be engaged to dine here to day will have quite gathering to celebrate return chapter xi thwarted plot espartero marched in on following day after spending three day in resting refitting army started on th of september in pursuit of don carlos pressing upon rear obtained welcome news that cabrera utterly disgusted with irresolution have left with command gone back to mountain colonel wylde have returned on day after espartero arrived hear have be doing good service captain hallett said when arthur called upon service be really nothing sir be not worth talking about carlist cavalry came galloping up against one of gate a there be regiment of urban guard drawn up there advised colonel to go out drive off took advice went out fired two volley carlists bolted yes quite admit that affair be unimportant in there can be equally doubt that have very wide consequence doubt don carlos sent on cavalry in hope that town must open gate to a may be sure partisan have promised to do when be so roughly received imagined that have be altogether misinformed that must meet with desperate resistance knowing how close espartero be behind concluded that must not be able to capture place before general arrived so drew off there can be doubt that hesitation at critical moment have sealed fate will never get basque to come down from mountain again be told also that did very gallant action down in south be that a well a affair here that induced christina to give order of san fernando knighthood will have pleasure in recommending to government at home that be permitted to accept wear decoration must not do at home without such permission certainly must not want to wear at home may be very useful to in country though indeed must hardly like to wear even here for have certainly done nothing to deserve such honour will really be glad sir if will send off again a speedily a possible for will be glad to escape from congratulation will have to receive if remain in madrid thing be likely to be quiet for time colonel said espartero have applied for army to be raised ministry be so jealous of that there be little chance that request will be granted will have to set off in pursuit of don carlos with small force at present real point of interest in spain be struggle between espartero government body of men utterly incapable wholly corrupt weakness unpopularity constitute greatest danger threatens country now that don carlos have retired have honour to be in confidence of christina feel deeply situation in be placed by intrigue jealousy of men unfortunately be powerless in hand can only endeavour to keep matter going to prevent open outbreak between various party however a want to get away may a well go with espartero will introduce to to morrow thank very much must far rather be moving about than staying here for feel that be drawing pay doing very little for colonel smiled be evident hallett that patience be not one of virtue have just be away for two month only returned three day ago however can understand madrid have great attraction for that prefer being actively employed have seen espartero morning intends to start again in two day time so will not have long to wait espartero received arthur warmly when colonel wylde presented on following day spoke strongly of service have rendered in getting regiment to go out meet carlist horse wish said that have few young officer ready to take initiative there be lack of bravery among troop obey order fight well have to see to everything doubtless thing will improve in time think that action of yours may have influence in showing officer of army that opportunity present sometimes when even youngest can make mark will be very glad indeed to have with trust that will consider on staff captain hallett must very well do so colonel wylde said alliance be becoming closer between two nation british marine sailor have be fighting in north be more than probable that force of regular troop will be sent from england only captain hallett must recollect that if take active part in engagement forfeit privilege a british commissioner will certainly if captured be treated a prisoner of war be quite ready to risk that sir arthur said yes must bear in mind must at moment be able to recall if need service elsewhere certainly sir will always hold at order loud regret be expressed by leon sister when heard that friend be leaving so soon can do good service here leon if choose how do mean well be clear enough that ministry divided a be on other point be united in jealousy of espartero who seems to one honest capable man in spain now if must endeavour to get up party to support to move public opinion so strongly in favour that will compel ministry to give adequate support expose to be kicked out will be doing great service to country saw condition of force when marched in yesterday utterly worn out fatigued almost in rag deficient in everything make up army if speak of on occasion stir up feeling among men of own class denounce government for refusing to supply with men mean to carry on war on proper scale will be doing immense amount of good will do so will become conspirator thoroughly agree with a to espartero will really devote to supporting henceforth will become public man make government tremble struck breast theatrically sister arthur broke into laugh seriously will devote to business arthur have felt for time ought to be doing something for country know nothing of soldiering can not very well ask for musket go out fight do think must be doing good in working for downfall of government for one hanger on follower have good word to say will begin by speaking indignantly of state of espartero army directly openly break with government will work heart soul to second effort be in too much of hurry leon know that men who have spoken out too loudly have be either sent to estate imprisoned begin at first by declaring that state of army be disgraceful attack government until espartero take field against when once doe so be convinced that dissatisfaction that exists will find voice that government will not dare to set against two day afterwards arthur follower started with espartero four day later found that don carlos be only three league in advance believing that force be resting for day espartero at once moved forward be ignorant of nature of country have be aware of must have caught in trap don carlos must have fallen into hand unfortunately a have to feel way down deep defile carlists discovered approach retired precipitately on th be found that don carlos have be joined by division espartero have also be strengthened therefore divided army into two corp one commanded by general lorenzo with fourteen battalion while retained command of other larger division few day later former force be attacked suddenly by superior carlist army defended with great obstinacy espartero started instantly when heard sound of firing arrived in time to save lorenzo attacking left centre of carlist force sent flying in disorder be however unable to follow up victory being forced to await arrival of convoy of clothing provision arrived two day later pressing forward picked up many deserter from carlist rank declared that discord confusion raged in carlist army that basque navarrese have declared determination to return to province whether don carlos be willing not in course of two three day army broke up altogether crossing ebro at various point under respective chief making way off to mountain espartero devoted remainder of year to organizing transport supply punishing act of indiscipline insubordination have broken out at various place a soon a operation ceased colonel wylde wrote to arthur requesting to go down to join general flinter english officer in service of spain who be about to be sent down to toledo at request of deputy of estremadura at once left espartero rode to toledo where arrived on same day a general flinter colonel wylde told that have sent to join captain hallett spoke very highly of energy courage will be very glad to have assistance place be nest of carlism central junta be here although at present moment can not take step against while remain quiet will not be very long before will be able to do so arthur took up quarter at same hotel a general for next fortnight aided in restoring discipline order among troop who have be in garrison there for time have fallen into slack state at end of time news be brought that carlist force under basilio garcia be approaching on raiding expedition flinter persuaded authority of town to join in declaring in state of siege now said may be able to lay hand on of carlist fellow if can obtain evidence against there be doubt that among be of leading men of province be afraid that even if catch will slip through finger government at madrid be a know very hostile to english sir george villiers minister be constantly urging to support espartero be in close communication with general therefore be opposed to be only because did not see how must refuse request of deputy of estremadura be allowed to come here may be sure that what with personal objection of minister to fact that men be wealthy enough to bribe right left will take action against however clear evidence may be able to bring forward still that make difference in duty will certainly lay hand on if can obtain anything like certain evidence who be considered principal duke de ladra be at house be likely to meet suppose yes must say so will set man to work be sharp fellow may be able to find out something about meeting roper have have time entirely on hand since arrival at toledo being of chatty disposition have already made great many acquaintance be good looking young fellow scarlet uniform opened door of good many house to roper arthur said to that evening know that be constantly getting up flirtation wherever go well sir roper said must do something sometimes have be hard work to kill time did say that for particular reason yes do happen to know anyone in household of duke de ladra well yes sir do know young woman there went with to festa yesterday evening well wish must find out in way when meeting of leading men of place be held there whether meet on particular day know that there be meeting last night sir because said be what called men evening therefore must get out well when see again roper might perhaps find out when next meeting will take place by asking when can come out next can manage easily enough sir looked enquiringly at master want to be present at roper do sir yes men be carlist conspirator can not seize without evidence against if must only overhear talk must be able to lay hand upon must not be easy sir quite see that think that if be to say that know cavalero who be very anxious to be present at one of meeting must willingly pay ten golden piece to anyone who must smuggle up back stair to point where must see what go on must be likely to accept money ca tell sir ten pound be large sum to one of servant who get more than two three pound year must tell of course that must never be known who have admitted must take oath not to betray if anything happened possibly might consent at rate must sound carefully must be quite marriage dot to must be dangerous business for sir if be caught yes when everything be arranged must get general flinter to send down body of troop under officer to surround house with warrant for arrest of person found within if be discovered must at once fire pistol must be signal for officer to rush in with soldier run upstairs to room a soon a heard noise must cease attacking might possibly be up there with if so think must certainly rely upon holding own against dozen conspirator for three four minute yes must say so sir half of be likely to be oldish men must be so surprised confounded at seeing that must lose time before making attack two day later roper brought news that have met young woman again be not unwilling to help that held out for twenty pound that meeting be held once week that there be likely to be in four day be to meet again to morrow evening be to tell whether be willing to pay twenty pound to hand to when let in yes will pay that be worth for if fellow organize rising in town at same time a carlists attack will be in very bad way when see to morrow will tell general on next evening roper brought news that everything be arranged that be to be at certain back door of duke mansion at nine o'clock on following thursday arthur then went in told general be capital plan captain hallett be deeply indebted to at same time be dangerous one a far a be concerned think there be much danger in sir in first place be not likely to be discovered if be man can defend till troop come up well if be ready to take risk there be question that scheme be advantageous one will remove very serious danger will on morning of thursday draw up order for arrest of person found at duke will soon after nine bring down hundred picked men may be sure that if hear pistol shot will instantly demand admittance rush up to assistance have better get information a to precise position of room so that may be able to make straight for not waste time in entering other room preparation worked smoothly at six o'clock in evening there be meeting of deputy warrant for arrest be signed few minute before nine arthur roper wrapped up in cloak carrying pistol a well a sword went round to door that woman have shown to latter roper knocked three time door be opened entered arthur handed to woman money have promised follow very quietly said there be fear of meeting anyone stair be never used after dark will take to room must arrange about own hiding place mind promise that happens will not betray be afraid arthur said will keep good faith with going up very cautiously in dark came presently to small landing be door said believe have arrived will come here in few minute opened door carefully looked in curtain be best hiding place said pointing to drawn across window think there be chance that will move closed door behind walked across to window took place behind curtain be room of considerable size table stood in middle at twelve chair be placed with writing material before talked together in low whisper if row take place will run to corner to left in way only two person can attack at once a will probably have nothing knife about ought to be able to keep off easily enough presently door opened twelve gentleman entered last to come in turned key in door one of went to door by arthur have entered locked that also then sat down began to talk be a general have thought probable arranging plan by party of men must seize various gate be to wait till major part of troop have issued out to meet carlists then band be to fall upon remained of present gave in list of number of follower friend must answer for total amounted to about six hundred agreed that number must probably be multiplied by four a be certain that large number of lower class of town must join though must not be prudent to take into plot till moment for action arrived arthur have heard enough be sure that by time house must be surrounded general ready to enter whispered to roper to be ready then turning round thrust pistol through window pulled trigger then a people at table sprang to foot roper leapt out took place in corner arthur saying have better surrender gentleman house be surrounded there be mean of escape several of younger men drew knife shrank back a arthur follower dropped cloak drew sword levelled pistol will only be throwing away life arthur said sternly armed a be be match for whole of listen can hear blow on door below there be indeed sound of loud knocking suddenly ceased conspirator spoke hastily together one man ran to table caught up of paper arthur fired at hand almost immediately afterwards there be loud knocking at door shrugging shoulder duke walked to turned key general followed by dozen soldier entered duke de ladra said be prisoner together with in room hold warrant of arrest against whole of on charge of treason against queen government have power to resist sir duke said will repent outrage think not duke town being in state of siege have full authority to act a have done warrant be also signed by ten of deputy of estremadura now gentleman wish to use violence will allow to take hat cloak must then march to place of detention matter will then be looked into will be tried by court martial duke bowed coldly gentleman said to friend for present must yield to force will doubtless have reckoning with gentleman later on quietly walked down stair general directed four soldier to remain with arthur until returned marched prisoner to jail placed strong guard over then returned to house plan have worked splendidly said to arthur have be managed without bloodshed altogether except have to put bullet through hand of one of who be about to destroy paper be list of number of men that bound to produce when rising took place heard be said yes related conversation have overheard room be then searched carefully number of paper letter to friend throughout country be discovered showing that preparation have be made for very formidable rising throughout province directly toledo fell into hand of carlists be well that nipped thing in bud general flinter said when examined paper be carried for purpose to room now dare say think that men will be executed be never more mistaken will try by court martial condemn to death government will smother whole thing up release impossible be not only possible certain men be playing double game in first place wish to keep well with side in second place hate first a englishman secondly a strong adherent of espartero in third place men will bribe government largely money will do anything in spain however one good thing will come of discovery of plot will excite immense alarm among connected with many when hear of seizure of compromising letter will move away from home at once until think that storm have passed over keep quiet instead of having whole country in flame will only have basilio force to deal with two day later court martial be held general officer sitting upon arthur roper repeated what have heard list of men must be supplied work for be to be told off be brought forward together with arrangement have be made between duke basilio prisoner be found guilty condemned to death proceeding of court martial sentence be sent off to madrid for confirmation by government now be off hand general said to arthur when tribunal broke up can turn attention to basilio without fear of leaving city unguarded two day later however messenger arrived post haste from madrid saying that proceeding have be most high handed that prisoner be merely to be kept in confinement for present at same time half of general flinter little force be at once to march for capital what did tell general said a threw order across table to arthur what do think of for government if have way must like to march to madrid seize whole of scoundrel hang from own balcony well have nothing to do obey order if think have prepared way for carlists to enter toledo be greatly mistaken will obey order send off troop will refrain from executing traitor will not let that part of order be known so will keep friend throughout country on thorn conspirator indeed have taken advantage of laxity of prison arrangement to send off large sum of money to member of government to endeavour to procure removal of general flinter government journal prepared way by violent abuse of general who have maltreated harmless men be brutal englishman in few day order be issued for removal carlists who be kept well informed of what be going on approached toledo actually obtained possession of bridge flinter be still there although have received notice of removal have three hundred men under command with sallied out after hard fighting drove enemy off started in pursuit received reinforcement a went being perfectly well acquainted with country be enabled to continue march night in morning came upon large body of carlists taking completely by surprise fell upon utterly routed more brilliant act have be performed during war government in vain endeavoured to belittle people be not to be deceived by flinter victory be regarded at true value pronounced so strongly in favour of that government be reluctantly obliged to yield made marshal de campo placed in charge of province of la mancha toledo action have great effect upon course of war in estremadura completely disorganized carlists among mountain of toledo set free important province robbed enemy of base for operation have arranged must take place there during approaching season arthur have ridden out with general to attack of party who have occupied bridge took part in night march in concluding victory general in report spoke very highly of courage service moreover gave full credit for discovery of plot capture of plotter government complained to sir george villiers colonel wylde of share have taken in operation replied that british officer be perfectly at liberty to take part in operation must strengthen royal cause that government be only too glad of assistance of british seaman marine in operation in north government then endeavoured to sow dissension between espartero cordova latter have now left army returned to madrid where have entered cortes cordova remained firm refused to be brought into intrigue further endeavoured to annoy espartero by displacing chief of staff in whom have implicit trust without consulting arthur have after defeat of carlists by general flinter returned to madrid gone to join espartero who on th of january arrived at villa nueva de mena found enemy strongly posted entrenched on right bank of river cadagua on morning of th attacked in three column under heavy fire after hard fighting succeeded in driving from four village have occupied fell back to still stronger position in rear from be also driven by one o'clock be in disorderly retreat owing to difficult country pursuit be attempted that day next morning espartero moved with eight battalion to berron iriarte going to right with four battalion after marching league found enemy strongly entrenched retreated on approach to fortified convent of santa isabel where have support of two biscayan regiment four battalion of navarrese occupied formidable height in heavy mass a soon a iriarte column became engaged with carlist left espartero attacked position of santa isabel in spite of very heavy fire with be met carried with rush advanced against height on chief force of enemy be posted here obstinate resistance be made before dark carlists have be dislodged at point of bayonet be in full retreat into mountain christinos remained near berron to protect evacuation of balmaseda place be at such distance from base that be considered impracticable to hold a supply of provision must only be kept up by mean of large escort at considerable loss of life be therefore decided to blow up fort withdraw garrison strengthening however fort at villa nueva de mena now became most advanced post of christinos be left in charge of general latre espartero returning to logrono in meantime however matter be going badly elsewhere fortress of morella benicarlo have just fallen into cabrera hand oraa who be opposing be calling loudly for reinforcement basilio garcia be plundering castile espartero now sickened by abuse have be poured upon by order of government at madrid determined to match against issued proclamation giving account of state of army suffering of soldier who be without pay often without food contempt with government while wringing money in manner from country turned deaf ear to request left army to starve proclamation have immense effect throughout country people have be so sedulously taught to believe that everything be going on well that troop be well fed regularly paid that exposition by general whom trusted believed came like thunder clap eventually brought about downfall of ministry from moment felt that espartero be master although still putting many difficulty in way did not venture openly to oppose be next movement of consequence be in connection with carlist expedition under negri have be despatched with intention of wasting hitherto unmolested province of galicia asturias be extremely important that expedition must be crushed because if carlists be permitted to lay waste province be rich well affected to christino cause there must be so great falling off in contribution that must be difficult in extreme to maintain army in field espartero set out with nine battalion fourteen gun without cavalry while general latre who be to follow by separate route have also nine battalion be in total ignorance of movement of negri who entered castile on th of march at soucillo discovered on th that have gone into asturias latre came up with on st although inferior in force have advantage espartero marched on leon to prevent entering galicia uniting with don basilio under good leader men have confidence christinos be capable of very long march on occasion travelled two hundred mile in nine day short time afterwards marched ninety two league in fourteen day while be doing good service iriarte with division twice a strong a of negri be resting quietly at alcobendas with apparent intention only of avoiding enemy have carlists remained in asturias after defeat by latre must have found great difficulty in escaping from united action of general espartero on hearing of espartero movement on leon counter marched on th of march be at belorado with latre division now under iriarte day march in rear espartero have also returned by forced march to palencia reckoned on finding after two three short march in front of enemy with iriarte only short distance in rear on night of th of march received despatch saying that carlist expedition have passed into castile like much of information obtained turned out to be untrue compelled to march in direction leaving pursuit of negri to iriarte chapter xii fiasco while espartero be waiting for news that negri be approaching learned that iriarte have inflicted check upon carlist leader that latter have again countermarched at once concluded that carlists must make for sierra de burgos marching with speed in direction at one o'clock on morning of nd instant came within sight of camp fire retreated did not overtake for time espartero with staff few mounted officer little escort of forty cavalry of guard twenty five english lancer have pressed on ahead of troop fearing that enemy must outmarch men get away placed at head of little party charged furiously down upon taken wholly by surprise at sudden attack not knowing what force have at back two thousand men surrendered to without resistance there be scene of wild enthusiasm among troop when came up saw what have be effected be little wonder indeed that espartero troop be so devoted to so ready to make exertion when called upon to do so to attack force of enemy against whom might be directed espartero possessed indeed attribute required of great general quick in decision prompt in action firm under disappointment ready to delay until right moment arrived for striking to hurl troop impetuously at point required taking greatest care for comfort of men able to bear calmly factious opposition of political antagonist to be patient under repeated blunder obstinate lethargy of military commander serving under great strong man in way only really great man spain have produced for past two century enthusiasm excited by daring action greatly strengthened espartero hold upon people in general destruction of negri expedition be complete for in addition to who have fallen in battle who have be taken prisoner fewer than two thousand have deserted during pursuit by iriarte have after being captured consented to join queen service be worth while to take part in affair roper one might live century not have

to that carlists be fool to go on with war be always on run say that fight bravely sometimes must have lost real hope of success everyone say be sick of don carlos yes be last sort of man with whom brave people must have sympathy be surrounded by mere adventurer hold entirely aloof from own general treat a haughtily a if be king who must bestow honour reward must think that be no longer really fighting to put on throne northern province be still holding out for privilege a to valencia aragon must say that be fighting from sheer obstinacy see what have to hope for have be struggling for four year so far have certainly held own thanks to energy of cabrera there must be end to sooner later when will find that have gained nothing by loss sacrifice espartero moved up to vittoria in june laid siege to fortified town of alava on high road from vittoria to pena cerrada town have be taken by carlists ten month previously have placed strong garrison in arrived in front of town on morning of th june be immediately attacked on left by six carlist battalion under guergue fighting went on day during night heavy gun be placed on battery against strong stone redoubt have be lately constructed by carlists on hill to north of town completely commanded distance be found however to be too great in morning espartero observing that skirmisher have be allowed to approach close to fort determined to carry by storm at once launched troop against fort be gallantly defended grenade stone other missile be hurled on attacking party number enthusiasm prevailed espartero be looking on soldier feeling invincible finally swarmed over parapet fort surrendered town be now summoned to surrender have be abandoned by governor who left garrison of only four hundred men to defend fired upon bearer of message on following morning gun opened upon firing lasted from seven in morning till two in afternoon many of house be demolished loss of besieger be heavy for be time exposed to serious attack on left led by guergue force have be reinforced during morning by four battalion from navarre espartero therefore decided upon dashing step leaving force to continue bombardment of town formed rest into four battalion with force cavalry attacked guergue who be strongly entrenched on wooded height supported by four gun a christinos entered wood be exposed to very destructive fire from navarre battalion advanced steadily without firing shot a pushed forward hail of round shot grape musketry swept at distance of three hundred yard crossed small ravine fell upon enemy while espartero launched cavalry against carlist column be opposed to abandoned artillery broke fled in direction battle have lasted hour in time four gun four hundred prisoner fell into hand of queen troop far larger number must have be taken have escape not be facilitated by intricate mountainous country a soon a defender of town saw that force on have relied for protection be defeated abandoned place made escape into wood behind garrison be placed in town army proceeded to logrono prepared for siege of estella while doing so have successful engagement with carlist commander in chief colonel wylde have joined espartero day two after capture of pena cerrada at once sent arthur south to join force with oraa be preparing to besiege morella here found three other english officer commissioner of british government who be to report doings of army above to urge that convention regarding treatment of prisoner must be observed morella be town of great natural strength lay in very heart of mountain be built on rising ground defended by twenty gun town canta vieja twelve mile distant formed head quarter of cabrera whose force amounted to little over ten thousand men have head quarter at teruel believed that carlist troop must not venture to defend morella cabrera troop differed materially from against whom espartero be fighting latter be peasant animated by desperate determination to defend what considered right privilege others be rough idle fellow fugitive from justice men who preferred life of adventure chance of plunder to work iron discipline maintained by leader welded into whole inspired with vigour bravery cabrera be in way a remarkable military genius a espartero while one carried on war mercifully other tarnished reputation by countless act of cruelty cold blooded murder force be arranged in three division advance be planned so that must arrive at same time in neighbourhood of morella on th of july oraa left teruel be joined on th by general baltho division on following day by san miguel on th of august be immediately in front of morella united force amounted to sixteen thousand infantry twelve thousand cavalry matter began badly oraa be well aware that supply of provision be scanty one yet allowed waste of store of grain must have supplied army for time wheat have be cut be lying in field instead of having collected placed under cover permitted troop to take corn to sleep on feed horse much of be used a fuel be not consumed be spoiled yet there be mill on ground also oven even from commencement of march commissariat arrangement for troop be anything lavish when force left teruel be supplied with four day bread seven day rice meat be issued to for six day then only received pound man yet during march troop be ascending to high ground rain fell in torrent temperature be much lower than to be accustomed by th of august allowance fell to six ounce of rice two ounce of bread on th last day of siege troop be almost without food cavalry horse other animal numbering at least three thousand have already be two day without forage have have barley since started twenty four day before other division be better off even scanty supply have be maintained with greatest difficulty five battalion have to be employed in keeping road open siege artillery must have be brought up in two day seven be found necessary army being assembled moved round to other side of morella having to fight hard to gain position san miguel division did not bring up gun till th of august operation being conducted so carelessly that road be left open for carlists who kept up constant fire killed one hundred fifty men on th siege began troop took up position drove portion of carlist levy back on morella next day however san miguel be ordered to make attack upon position occupied by carlists interfered with movement of body of troop about to proceed down to escort convoy of provision cabrera reinforced threatened point san miguel attacked boldly carried three position one after at fourth however be so strongly opposed that oraa ordered to retreat a did not consider position of sufficient importance to justify further fighting attack however be so far successful that force sent to escort convoy managed to make way down on th heavy artillery be taken to place fixed upon for establishment of battery gun be placed about five hundred yard away from wall mortar twice distance next day be devoted to erecting battery opened fire at daybreak on th of august shooting be far from accurate enemy return be steady spot selected to be breached be gate between flanked by two tower known a gate of san miguel directly cabrera saw point about to be attacked began to construct strong retrenchment behind with parapet ditch defended by chevaux de frise following day when breach began to be formed heaped up on great quantity of combustible although breach be very imperfect oraa issued order for assault on evening of lth to english officer with besieger looked like act of madness oraa felt that success must be instant siege must be given up on account of impossibility of feeding troop attacking column be formed in rear of battery where remained for three hour then advanced with band playing to within hundred fifty yard of breach broken nature of ground threw into confusion be midnight before arrived at breach up to time dead silence have reigned in morella by music if by other mean garrison be kept perfectly informed of motion progress of enemy cabrera have issued strict order that must remain silent until troop have reached foot of breach moment arrived there brilliant flame darted up from breach tremendous fire of bullet hand grenade stone burst upon red glare rose higher higher men enfeebled by hunger fatigue stood appalled many however rushed forward with desperate bravery only to fall under storm of missile at last fell back finding absolutely impossible to surmount obstacle posted there never be men sent upon more hopeless task that evening earnestly looked for convoy arrived have have to fight whole distance up waggon have be lost over eighty men next day passed quietly then be decided to make assault at daybreak on th although attempt have be made to enlarge breach render more practicable fifteen hundred men advanced at daybreak in two column provided with ladder sand bag with to climb bottom of breach where wall have not be destroyed a advanced be received with heavy fire of artillery musketry fire again blazed upon breach left column on reaching foot of wall climbing ladder found too short fell back in great disorder right column in front of breach found impossible to ascend unassisted space be too confined to admit of formation of number of troop at only one place very narrow steep be possible to climb many officer men who tried to make way up died in attempt seeing absolute hopelessness of attack oraa ordered retreat troop fell back having lost two hundred seventy six killed wounded be at once decided to raise siege without provision ammunition must have be madness to persevere retreat be accompanied by terrible hardship be continuously harassed by swarm of guerrilla march be slow short wounded be carried in hundred on door window shutter when five day later army reached alcaniz be found that brought down fifteen hundred wounded in addition to dead left behind arthur have not be present at two assault have ridden down with troop left on th when be attacked have at request of officer in command ridden up to small tower where twenty men be posted to keep down fire of surrounding carlists be to have be drawn off a troop passed carlists interposed in such great force between main body that be impossible for to sally out there be nothing to do arthur said to officer in command of little party to defend here may leave alone pardenas will be back with convoy to morrow then will be relieved be pity that did not bring horse with sir might then have managed to escape certainly must not have left in lurch did not bring horse with because knew that a pace must be very slow must be easier to go on foot now have better set to work at once a soon a carlists have finished with convoy will come back to place be old fortified house now almost ruin stone be piled in doorway prepared for desperate defence be not long before party of carlists drew off from harassing column approached house shouted to soldier to surrender replied with musket shot when two hundred men have assembled round place assault began men defended bravely many of assailant fell drew off several time when darkness came on however crawled up to house set to work to pull down barricade at entrance defender went up to top of house dropped stone down upon for time fight went on gradually stone of barricade be dislodged storm of fire drove away defender officer in command have fallen arthur called men up into story above here defence continued until only five men be left carlists however have suffered so heavily that drew back once more summoned defender to surrender be use fighting longer roper arthur said to follower who be sitting on floor with bullet through leg what do say lad have done can do said have promised life be ready to surrender can be worse off even if keep word will certainly be killed if hold out longer will surrender arthur called down if will swear to spare life if wo do will fight on will cost good many life before overpower there be consultation below then officer came forward said promise life if surrender arthur at once went down stair handed sword to officer men followed leaving musket above two of assisting roper downstairs be brave fellow carlist said have cost dearly however did duty a have done how many of have fallen fifteen officer commanding have cost double that number well will stop here for night body of who have fallen be carried out of house fifty of carlists established there prisoner be ordered into room above four of captor be told off with musket to watch at foot of stair arthur have now time to examine bandage roper leg ball have broken ankle arthur first put roll of cloth round then cut piece of wood put foot into splint bandaged with sash be awfully sorry roper be afraid will have to go through good deal of agony before can get leg properly attended to can not be helped man said have reason to grumble have be through good many fight be first time have be hit well wish have be caught anywhere else must have be nuisance being made prisoner in other part of spain certainly fancy falling into cabrera hand again after way robbed of prey last time can expect mercy from now of course fact that have be taken actually fighting against doe away with claim one might set up on ground of being neutral suppose can take to cabrera yet at rate may have chance of making escape before do certainly will not try to get away unless be well enough to make off with be afraid that be not likely to be for time hope will not think of thing a roper said earnestly in first place remaining here with must do good on contrary might do harm for cabrera will probably recognize must be sure to share fate on other hand if be away certainly must not know must have a good chance a of others think must make difference indeed if be alone chance be that must be shot at once a men must not trouble to carry wounded prisoner along with whereas with prisoner must consider that must receive a good treatment a until cabrera give order respecting in morning prisoner be marched up into mountain next day party be now swollen by many others went down to brow of hill near morella christino prisoner be made to carry roper who suffered great deal from pain in ankle here remained for week greater portion of carlists went off day to take part in fighting on occasion of two assault on fortress watched with intense interest struggle at breach went into ecstasy of delight at repulse of assailant illustration ah said so have laid hand on at last when army began retreat guard of ten men remained with prisoner rest went away to join in harassing retreating foe be week before returned inflammation in roper leg have now somewhat subsided arthur kept continually bathed have twice be dressed by surgeon who came up to attend to wounded carlists who be also there two day passed then just a be getting dusk one evening cabrera rode in chatted for time to men then said hear that have officer prisoner here let see arthur be brought up to light of fire cabrera started on seeing uniform then seizing brand held close to prisoner face ah said so have laid hand on at last be second visit to camp senor englishman last time be received a british commissioner abused permission by interfering in plan by killing two of men by carrying off prisoner condemned to death hear that be captured time when fighting with christinos have therefore forfeited right to protection from uniform tie man to tree shoot at daybreak instruction be at once followed arthur be fastened by leathern thong wound tightly round round body servant be also here one of men said have broken leg put by side of master shoot in morning ask mercy for cabrera know that must be hopeless to do so from such bloodthirsty ruffian a poor fellow have only acted under order be entitled to fair treatment cabrera who be standing by fire few yard away turned round angrily dare to insult before soldier said furiously dog of englishman insult arthur repeated be possible to insult do not glory in crime be there true man in spain who doe not spit on ground when hears name of monster cabrera caught musket from hand of one of men levelled fired arthur felt stinging pain in arm then felt leathern thong bound slacken unwind fall off have be cut by bullet quick a thought slipped round tree dashed off at top of speed so quickly have taken place that be few second before carlists understood what have happened have gained forty fifty yard before with yell whole of started after night have now completely fallen be already almost out of sight dozen musket be discharged at random be untouched running at top of speed began to descend slope behind hill going uphill knew that carlists sturdy mountaineer must have speedily overtaken felt sure that downhill must leave hampered by musket heavy shoe must have little chance of catching ran for few hundred yard mob of men behind be now out of sight when came to great rock threw down behind in minute crowd of men ran past a soon a have done so got up listened there be none behind turned ran up hill again when reached place saw a expected cabrera standing alone by fire whole of men having joined in chase have be armed must have rushed to attack being without weapon broke into walk making slight circuit kept tree by roper have be placed between fire stepping very quietly moved up to hush roper whispered be roper in excitement have managed to raise up have worked round tree where be standing listening to shot in distance put arm round neck arthur said get on back sir hamper with shut up arthur said do a tell be not going without roper did a be told got on to arthur back held on with knee arm get up a high a can arthur said putting arm under man knee started off a have come still keeping tree between fire when felt that be beyond circle of light turned off made away in other direction for three hour walked on stopping occasionally putting roper down then after quarter of hour rest going on progress be slow a have to pick way between rock bush at end of three hour felt certain that be out of sight of anyone on hill above morella lay down in thick clump of bush will do for to night roper said think can go farther think be fairly safe here will have to lie quiet to morrow for there may still be party hanging about harassing troop think have be pretty well managed affair first rate sir be sorry have burdened with talk nonsense roper be just a likely to make off thus a if have be by now first thing to do be to put handkerchief round arm that ball went between body be not much more than graze still fancy have be bleeding good deal for have felt weaker for last hour so took off coat cut off sleeve of shirt roper then tore up bound round wound then put on coat again lay down together for warmth how furious cabrera will be when come back say can not find suppose will think anything about till morning will hardly guess that came back for will think that crawled away short distance will hunt about for in neighbourhood must like to hear cabrera remark when come back empty handed well will not want rocking to sleep fancy five minute will do for when woke up be broad daylight arthur got up went to edge of bush looked out see nobody about said at rate must wait here till get dark cabrera will keep men looking for day there be patch of uncut wheat short distance away will go cut armful will be something for to munch went out broke off head of a much grain a must carry brought back to shelter passed day munching wheat talking sometimes sleeping there be house look a if be in ruin on rise two mile away will try to get there to night be not at likely to be visited by carlists a go will cut a much wheat a can carry in clothes take up station there well have be thinking sir that if must cut good strong sapling with fork for to use a crutch must make shift to get along can carry very well roper must much rather that made crutch sir arm be certainly not fit for use must much rather try other way then if find ca get on must carry searching about among clump arthur found suitable sapling have be deprived of sword when captured pocket have not be searched have still knife with cut trimmed stick with roper cloak wound round round answered well a crutch started a soon a be dark gathered sufficient quantity of grain to last for day then made way to house crossed little stream quarter of mile away there drank heartily arthur have gathered faggot of dry stick on way when arrived at house made fire in corner sat there talking for hour two then wrapping in cloak lay down to sleep next morning explored place roof be gone found that there be staircase leading up to turret that upper chamber of be still intact here determined to establish have better wait here for fortnight roper by time may be able to walk be certain that carlists will be moving about between here alcaniz must be very dangerous to try make way down there will be losing nothing for may be sure that will be time before oraa will make advance again when go out next will cut couple of good club if only two three carlists happen to drop in here may be able to defend at rate will be comfort to have mean of making fight for life will carry away ash of fire so that party come in will not discover that place have be inhabited be not likely that anyone entering will take trouble to come up here four day passed day arthur collected sufficient faggot for fire in evening a long a burned kept coat hanging against loophole to prevent glow from being seen from without morning at daybreak evening after dark went down to stream brought up with full of water broken vessel have found on third evening saw party of twenty men approaching at once went up to turret room roper be now getting accustomed to use of crutch be able to make way about with little activity men came in arthur descending stair heard agree to sleep there for night several went out to get wood presently great bonfire be burning within meat be cut from calf have brought in cooked after eating supper men sat chatting around fire later on one of said say old house be haunted year ago robber lived here who preyed on traveller say that once carried off maiden in night scream be heard girl jumped off top of turret be killed after spirit haunted place groan cry be heard nightly in turret a even robber must not stop here house fell into decay once twice traveller have spent night here have always be obliged to leave owing to dreadful noise be hundred year ago silence followed recital then one said doubt ghost be laid by time for one vote against leaving good fire going outside to shiver night two three others agreed talk went on a before a arthur must detect there be longer same tone of jollity pause in conversation be frequent at about eleven o'clock talk died away be evident that men be lying down to sleep went up to roper told of what have heard tell what roper have set mind on having of calf have be living on grain for past fortnight smell of meat cooking have worked up to point feel must get share of happens have be thinking over feel sure can manage what have be saying have put idea into head will give scare if hear nothing may station in house for for day in morning one of may take into head to come up here first of will strike twelve heavy blow with stick on floor then will give deep groan shriek in a unearthly tone a can may be sure will send flying out chapter xiii desperate attempt arthur struck a hard a must twelve blow with stick listened there be dead silence below then gave three deep groan while roper followed with succession of such wild scream cat call that arthur found unable for minute to continue then relieved with loud quavering laughter two kept up almost demoniac noise for two three minute have heard wild rush below arthur going to loophole heard men shouting running terror stricken in distance then have good laugh over fright have given carlists knew that must now lie down sleep till morning peasant be fearfully superstitious must not come near place again to night if be offered fifty guinea apiece however must not answer for in morning so a soon a begin to be light will go out at gap at back of house hide up for bit in bush may muster up courage enough to come back think will accordingly went out in morning hid in bush hundred yard from house three hour passed a there be sign of carlists went down to house again here found that carlists have left calf behind cooked slice made hearty breakfast four more day passed then roper said that although must not yet put foot to ground be quite sure that with help of crutch must hobble at rate four five mile can not try to get across rough country must take to road know run something like mile in front of house will have to keep ear open in case carlists must be near if hear party coming a there be moon will only have to go thirty forty yard from road lie down till have passed slept day started a soon a night fell roper found harder work than have expected hobbled on stopping two three hundred yard to rest after going a near a must calculate four mile saw light on road ahead of felt sure that be carlist outpost accordingly left road going four five hundred yard to left lay down among rough rock in morning must make out ten carlists kept quiet day during time made careful examination of ground in front of a be evident that must have to keep off road until well past carlist outpost be doubt close to spot from must command view of long stretch of road ahead when darkness be coming on made meal of veal have cooked before starting corn a soon a be quite dark started ground be rough arthur have to support roper for considerable distance fire be indication of exact point where out post be keeping watch a two sentry might be thrown out mile farther ahead did not dare go down on to road by morning have not gone more than two mile so painful have be work of making way along through rock must see one on road lay down in shelter with firm belief that must get to alcaniz next night evening started again taking to road kept on steadily night to satisfaction saw when morning dawned town of alcaniz mile away arthur be heartily greeted on arrival found to great satisfaction that two horse have be brought down by english officer have really very little hope of returning quite gave up when be found that be not with when got here hope faded altogether when failed to come in after miserable failure to take place man seems to have fared very badly yes have ankle broken by musket shot day be cut off however be healing nicely though think will ever have use of joint again well come into quarter bring with must think probably that be wanting something to eat be may say that since have be taken prisoner have have nothing corn to eat till three day ago when be lucky enough to get veal frightened party of carlists into leaving behind for giving roper into hand of orderly who be charged to give something to eat a soon a possible lieutenant line took arthur up to quarter in hour ample meal be set before now tell adventure arthur host said a lit cigarette arthur gave full account of well be not born to be shot hallett be quite evident that fight in old house be hard one a lost fifteen out of twenty to come out of unharmed be nothing to escape from cabrera shot at thirty yard distance rescue of man be splendid poor fellow must have have bad time of yes never complained once though must see at time that be suffering abominably be horribly afraid a made way down must fall among rock much a tried to steady if have done so have doubt that must have lost foot a be hope will not be long before be riding behind again suppose there be nothing new here nothing except grumbling artillery declare that did work well everyone else say that did badly declare that infantry ought to have carried place know best troop in world must not have done cavalry infantry declare man jack of engineer ought to be hanged well know that be not all right arthur laughed from place where be standing must see straight into town there be great retrenchment behind breach have got up breach through fire at top must simply have be mown down like sheep after man who ought to be hanged be oraa blundered hideously from moment started arrived before town without provision acted a if have only village with mud wall to storm instead of really formidable fortress certainly must be tried by court martial shot in other european country a be hope may never be employed again at rate there be chance of anything being done for time business have ruined espartero plan in north where be a know preparing to besiege estella there can be little doubt that affair will compel to break off preparation come down here force be practically hors do combat for present while enormous prestige that cabrera will acquire will bring peasantry flocking to banner in crowd news will be received with enthusiasm by carlists over spain will therefore be necessary to concentrate man who can be brought up to strike heavy blow at a will probably be two three month before espartero can be in position to do will leave for madrid lost good deal of blood from wound in arm for past three week have have very rough time will leave also other said town be one great hospital be especially attached to army must remain near will move off twenty thirty mile first thing must do be to get surgeon to examine roper leg think for moment that anything can be done for can bandage more skilfully better than have be able to do make more comfortable for poor fellow next day arthur mounted roper must not hear of being left behind ca put foot in stirrup said can ride with other leg only get loop over from stirrup to go under other knee make sort of sling for if get tired of riding way can get leg over saddle ride like woman will do anything rather than be left behind so by easy stage rode to madrid where arthur be joyfully greeted by count leon sister roper leg be again examined by surgeon who said that be going on very well that ankle must always be stiff wo matter roper said will only be like having wooden leg with appearance of natural one wo interfere with riding at suppose will feel much when get accustomed to when arthur came to recount adventure friend be horrified at risk have run donna mercedes turned pale when heard that have be in power of cabrera what escape what escape leon said to think that bullet must have set free seems almost miraculous be noble of to go back to fetch soldier donna inez said clapping hand oh be splendid be always doing splendid thing mercedes said must promise senor arthur that will never run risk of falling into cabrera hand again twice have escaped third time will assuredly be fatal must certainly be fatal to one of if have have weapon when went back must have finished quarrel then there however will willingly promise not to run risk of falling into hand again if can help will be very unhappy if go way again donna inez said sha' mercedes mercedes only nodded head be evidently too moved to speak well go on with story leon said left with man riding on back laughed heartily when told how have obtained meat by acting on superstition of native be running great risk have right to do mercedes said if have be keeping life together on raw corn for three week think that must think perfectly justified in running good deal of risk in obtaining supply of meat really did not consider that there be risk at knowing how superstitious peasant be think donna mercedes that yourself after having heard story with such surroundings must have felt more than little uncomfortable when heard gruesome noise be made by roper especially may say by roper be so sorry to hear of injury mercedes said in tone of great concern be very sorry too be sad thing make light of there be little doubt that though will be able to walk joint will always be stiff will certainly be able to ride leon must take round to have chat with must see if there be anything can do to make comfortable be up senor oh yes be up lying on sofa think that must hobble along with stick if tried of course will not be allowed to make experiment how long be going to stay here arthur must think fortnight three week week later however roper be able to walk with stick must ride again without discomfort keeping leg in stirrup putting weight entirely on left leg repulse at morella have brought to climax indignation of populace against government duke de frias have be called upon to form ministry be a much influenced by jealousy of espartero a predecessor kept narvaez at head of new army of reserve formed in neighbourhood of capital sort of rumour be current of plot conspiracy one day fortnight after return to madrid arthur be riding through street followed by roper when two queen drove past a usual when driving about city have guard outrider merely coachman on box two footman standing behind arthur saluted a passed carriage be closed one must see that only queen queen mother be inside roper rode out mile into country be turning to come back when four five gentleman rode along in party arthur knew two three of by sight bow be exchanged a passed party of pleasure suppose said to roper though weather be beginning to get cold for excursion to country mansion minute later carriage came along blind be drawn there be two footman behind wonder what have got blind down for be not often one see that even if there be one in carriage two three hundred yard farther back party of gentleman came along be curious roper one must think that two party of gentleman be acting a escort to carriage rode along for half mile then checked horse suddenly have exclaimed did notice that near horse in carriage have curious mark in centre of forehead sort of crescent seemed familiar to have be wondering where saw before now have be one of horse in queen carriage passed to day be not same carriage be certainly same horse there be something wrong why must carriage be going along with blind down why must half dozen men be riding quarter of mile in front a many more behind tell roper thing look to very serious three men knew in first lot be generally believed to be carlist sympathizer be possible that have carried queen off disappearance just at present moment when thing have be going so badly must cause turmoil throughout country if be missing don carlos must seem to be only possible successor must follow thing up find out at risk whether suspicion be correct be grievous pity be not in uniform have weapon with however can buy sword pistol somewhere a go along probably will change horse somewhere farther on may have relay at various point on road mean of course that can fight escort if can find out for certain that have captured queen can give information at town where there be garrison swoop down upon at rate must follow if necessary to french frontier though be not likely that intend to go so long distance will probably carry captive to country chateau in retired spot perhaps hundred fifty two hundred mile away of course may be wrong altogether if find that have relay will be matter of certainty that be carrying off someone of importance mark on horse must certainly seem to point to fact that have taken queen however may make up mind that have long ride before roper right sir be willing to ride through spain though wish leg be right again think must go on night on horseback must not be of much use dismounted think be likely to come to fighting know that there be twelve of probably man on box two men behind also belong to party there will be servant retainer at house where stop must not think of attacking such force a by what have to do be to find out who be carrying off if be queen can get help if be may still rescue damsel of importance by time be galloping along road must time pace well by theirs be going at sharp trot do must not show on road behind have better drop back ride good quarter of mile behind if see one solitary horseman far in rear must not think much of if saw two of might possibly suppose that be following must get sight of occasionally matter how far off so a to be sure that have not turned off from main road roper reined in horse arthur rode forward until came to crest of slight brow a head rose above must make out horseman mile half in advance instant did so checked horse dismounted for few minute when went forward saw that group of horseman be mere black mass on road feeling certain that single figure must not be made out at distance rode on at gallop now then caught sight of when did so always checked horse for time at last on reaching crest of hill stopped suddenly dismounted for saw group gathered in front of wayside inn not more than mile away left horse behind stood against wall so that figure must not be seen against sky line a looked saw party start again so waiting until be well away followed five mile farther when at distance from small town observed that turned off have doubt that intended to make circuit so a to pas round unobserved waited until roper came up have turned off here said will ride straight through town post near next road come in on side follow watch road closely ca help seeing track of so large party ride pretty fast till sight if a expect take turn again come down upon main road will know have followed if turn off in other direction must trace to halting place then ride to junction of two road where will be waiting will remain there until come however long may be unless follow along main road understand sir be comfort to know that a long a be daylight can not miss be when get dark that will have difficulty when doe get dark roper must muffle foot of horse then close up till can hear in way will keep in touch arthur rode quietly through town halted mile beyond where road came in on side on have seen carriage turn off placed horse behind wall few yard from junction went forward until stooping down behind bush must obtain sight of a passed ten minute later heard clatter of horse advance guard passed then heard wheel of carriage a came along must see that blind be still down a have expected horse have be changed five minute after last party of horseman have passed roper came up stop there roper arthur said standing up must wait till have gone bit farther before go out into road well be more than ever convinced that there be someone of very greatest importance in carriage mere fact that have taken trouble to make detour be sufficient in to show that be afraid be in for long ride ca be helped sir be real bit of excitement though not quite so exciting a be when carried on back excitement will come when have to undertake job of finding out for certain who be have carried off fact though five six at rate of rider be men of importance in point most strongly to idea that have carried off queen have doubt many of have changed horse if be intended to take long distance will have sent off relay of horse probably placed in two three to small roadside inn will have to change horse too somewhere animal have have easy time can be reckoned upon for fifty mile a have time to give rest can not ride farther than that have gone good twenty five mile already at next wayside inn come to will halt for five minute take bit out of mouth give bread dipped in wine do same at end of ten mile by road be going be making for ebro will strike at alcola think that medinaceli lie about fifty sixty mile from there know of large town between alcola latter place be only about twenty mile from saragossa so can get troop from there from tudela if turn north so hope will hold on a far a fancy be little over hundred mile from here be dark when rode into small town have seen party ahead enter without attempting to make detour waiting for few minute rode in to principal hotel landlord arthur said number of friend have just ridden through town have not yes sir about ten minute ago made stay here have be trying to overtake horse be done up can procure couple of fresh one be willing to pay well for hire must be good yes sir happen to have couple of good one in stable well tell men to slip saddle bridle on to at once see that horse be well attended to if have something hot ready please set on table at once have not moment to waste in quarter of hour be on way again rode hard for next ten mile have bought blanket at town now cut into strip muffled horse foot then rode on again in half hour must plainly hear sound of horse foot ahead night

quite sufficient guide arthur judged that there must be possibility of approaching place where stopped before therefore did not attempt to lessen start party have obtained after riding for about

be that will most of take to bed remain there till morning slept until landlord knocked at door said that dinner be served then after bathing head to wake thoroughly went downstairs ate hearty meal be arranged that must take horse a near a dared to house so that in case of discovery must at once ride away so get sufficient start to defy pursuit leaving horse with roper at distance of three four hundred yard from house arthur went up to walked slowly round shutter in front of house be not closed curtain be drawn by looking between however must see that party be at dinner there be light in two three window upstairs be probable that in one of room prisoner be placed going round house again still more carefully saw that shutter of one of lower window be closed struck a possible that captive be here being served with meal at same time a captor at rate said to can try here if curtain be drawn shutter closed be not likely to hear open window have ladder by to reach upper window so determined to take advantage of men being at dinner attempt bold stroke be certain that many of guest must be stranger to servant in house that who met in passage must take for one of went to front door tried be open peered in hall be deserted watched for minute two a saw servant pas repass guessed that kitchen be on same side of house a dining room whereas closed window be on other side dropped

mile must get troop here by daylight if can a galloped away told roper how have managed to see queen be bold stroke sir succeeded splendidly only hope wo ask men on guard if anyone have be there thought of roper chance of be very small must not imagine that there be anyone who wanted to see queen be improbable that conspirator have mentioned to anyone in house who prisoner be be likely that guard be only told when be placed there that lady be fatigued with journey must not be disturbed secret be too important to trust anyone with at first village come to must engage man with horse to act a guide will never find way across country without one in quarter of hour came to village stopped at inn landlord arthur said want man on horseback to guide to tudela be important that must get there

colonel said after reading through two three time have official seal be altogether unlike document one must expect to receive from majesty be so colonel majesty be not in position to affix seal signature be hers be be important now sir will tell have happened majesty queen christina daughter have be carried off from madrid by party of armed conspirator be at present moment at chateau of

white mark on head of one of horse mark have very morning noticed on head of one of in queen carriage matter struck a being so strange that determined to follow kept near way have relay of horse at various point on road changed quickly managed also to change mine that of servant with finally traced to count de monterey be still in doubt a to whether be majesty who be in coach succeeded in obtaining private interview saw minute have prepared document for signature be lucky enough to obtain now colonel know a much about matter a do arthur must see that officer be highly delighted at thought of opportunity have fallen in way ran back to room made more elaborate toilet arthur went off at once to hotel to see if arrangement there be going on three horse be at door so sat down with roper ate hasty supper now landlord said want to send two horse to address here be couple of pound for trouble horse ridden by landlord who acted a guide here must be kept till to morrow say will come

over quarter latter said have done very smartly captain zeno know way cavalero man with lantern doe guided here guide roper with lantern rode off at head of column colonel arthur followed former calling up captain to side dare say be wondering what be called up so suddenly for captain zeno gentleman be bearer of order for arrest of count de monteroy person in house must ride fast for be important that will get there in time to take in house by surprise will be light at six so hope will get there by time if not be likely that will arrive before anyone be stirring be understand important that none of people there will escape carlists suppose captain asked know colonel replied there be particular whatever in order be simply for arrest innkeeper be now better mounted than before journey be done in little over five hour day have broken a approached house must see sign of life colonel posted forty of men round house with order to cut down anyone who tried to escape then with other ten men captain arthur went up to hall door knocked loudly minute two later knocked again be opened by servant who have evidently just risen started at appearance of soldier will lead at once to master bedroom arthur said seeing that colonel have drawn sword servant without moment hesitation conducted to count de monterey room arthur accompanied by colonel went in count opened eye then sprang suddenly out of bed arrest count juan de monteroy on charge of high treason resistance senor be useless have fifty soldier round house ten of behind here count swore deep oath then shrugged shoulder so there be traitor among said scornfully senor party have be true to arthur said colonel called in two men will remain here with gentleman will allow to dress see that touch paper document of kind when have finished can bring below there keep strict watch over until further order colonel went from door to door with men arrested whole party without resistance there be twelve of who have be left behind on way having arrived late previous evening after seeing to arrest of count arthur followed by two soldier ordered one of trembling domestic who have now come down to take to room of lady child who have arrived day before two guard stood beside do know why be placed here asked sternly senor except came on guard at eleven last night be ordered to allow one to enter room to refuse to allow lady inside to come out unless escorted by count well be relieved from duty now will go downstairs remain there may want to question again presently then knocked at door be immediately opened queen christina came out be expecting morning senor looking out of window saw ride up with troop arthur waved two soldier to move away madam said know what wish may be thought a well to keep knowledge of identity from save colonel come in here queen be dressed before say anything else senor must thank with heart for inestimable service that have rendered thank in name of queen of myself of spain be obliged to for having kept identity secret have be thinking matter over since saw last night learned that there be chance of rescue must certainly prefer that must return to madrid a have come incognito what have passed there know not think possible that government have kept fact of disappearance from knowledge of people must wish to consult with when get back a to advisability of continuing to do so will of course take better precaution in future news have once be carried off might lead desperate men to repeat attempt however will have time to talk over on journey must certainly wish to start a soon a possible can leave in hour madam can travel a fast a came here there be relay of horse on way escort can not keep up with a there must be possibility of procuring remount for so many men there must be occasion for escort because can ride with blind up by keeping veil down there will be risk of being recognized what do wish done with regard to prisoner madam queen hesitated have not thought what do say captain hallett have done so much in matter will trust to opinion must think madam that might perhaps be a well to send under charge of colonel who have come with troop to tudela to leave here in charge in case holding responsible for safety then must consult with minister a to what step must be taken might seem preferable to that trial if trial there must be must take place at provincial town rather than capital must think must be better guarded at barrack at tudela than here will order breakfast to be brought up here madam will take below must rather have here be quarter to seven now will be ready to start at eight may present colonel to madam before start be most zealous started with troop of cavalry in extremely short time after hearing message be only one of here who know of majesty identity certainly present to will of course see that receives promotion doe majesty wish to accompany of course do senor thought so much matter of course did not mention have very very much to say to for know nothing at present a to how came to be here at appointed hour queen came downstairs went into drawing room where spanish colonel be presented to christina spoke to very graciously thanked for service said must be shortly recognized must wish said to keep prisoner in entire seclusion let have communication with anyone let men who supply want be distinctly warned on account to exchange word with think best plan might be for to have house cleared out for so that can be placed in room apart with sentry at door sentry round house to see that communicate with one might be better for to requisition prison see that present inmate be placed elsewhere rely upon absolute secrecy colonel a to daughter having be here can not say what course government will take in matter therefore rely upon to keep absolutely apart from communication until receive order from madrid held out hand to colonel who kissed retired much gratified carriage be at door count coachman who have driven down be placed on box roper took place beside two soldier dressed in plain clothes took place behind one other similarly dressed mounted one of count horse led have be ridden by arthur roper arthur have be commanded by queen to take place in carriage with know gentleman do not isabella regent said a drove off child have be gazing fixedly at arthur yes mamma think do be handsome gentleman be who be presented to time ago for doing something very brave yes dear said liked know yes did mother ought to like great deal more now isabella for have done something very great for be too young yet to understand can tell that have done very very great service one must never forget a long a live now senor have be in vain wondering how be that must have arrived in room in manner of good fairy last night be almost by accident madam be there be due to fact that count de monterey made mistake of putting horse out of carriage into own instead of taking others then related fully manner in suspicion have be aroused how have with man followed carriage of course majesty if have be in way sure that be in carriage must have closed up at first town came to called upon authority for aid to rescue beyond mark on horse there may be more than one horse so marked in spain have nothing upon must act carriage evidently belonged to party who rode with mere fact that blind be drawn down be in proof that prisoner be in might have be merely full of wine provision for use of party going down to stay at chateau be therefore absolutely necessary for to assure that be prisoner might have be most difficult thing to find out have in vain on journey thought over plan a turned out be a have told simply matter of good fortune closed shutter pointed out room where be likely to be from fact that dinner be going on be able to get to door of room unchallenged guard took for one of count guest thus everything be easy simple of course moment left majesty rode straight to tudela started with troop on return journey twenty minute after arrived well senor hardly know to admire most recognition of horse quickness of perception that something very unusual be being done manner in in spite of immense fatigue of journey kept in sight of until traced here fearlessness with risked life a certainly did to ascertain whether suspicion be correct now will tell how be seized of course coachman footman must have be heavily bribed be driving through town when suddenly turned in at gateway of house in quiet street must not now say where house be for be talking to isabella paid particular attention to route by be proceeding to palace moment entered number of gentleman came round door be opened one said must trouble to alight ' began to demand what meant by such insolence cut short by saying beadam repeat that queen must alight have time to spare unless at once descend enter carriage standing here will most reluctantly be obliged to use force ' seemed to that must be useless to resist for be evident that men be desperately in earnest must not hesitate to carry out threat so did a be ordered lady believe be relation of count from what said afterwards got into carriage followed by gentleman blind be then pulled down man took out long dagger said 'if move madam attempt to pull up blind to give alarm will not hesitate to stab daughter to heart a safety that of score of other people must demand must deplore necessity must not hesitate to act ' after have driven for hour got out must hear horse brought up to door mounted have doubt that carriage be accompanied by mounted men woman be of powerful build after have once started gave up idea of trying to give alarm must felt sure be fatal when blind be first pulled down heard one of men speak furiously because horse be not in carriage someone else said something said 'what doe matter if be hour earlier than expected ought to have be ready take horse out of carriage ' there be running about pair of horse be put in then one said be sure that directly have gone carriage be broken up burnt there must not be splinter of left nothing to show that anyone have ever be here see to ferdinand have got saw everything else remember safety of of may depend upon being done thoroughly ' three minute later started almost seemed to be in nightmare from did not awake till got to end of journey chatted with isabella did not exchange single word with woman in carriage with from time to time when stopped to change horse tray of food be handed in ate drank though have little appetite felt that must keep up strength for have idea how long strange journey must last what must happen at end of that have be captured by adherent of don carlos have of course doubt did not fear that must be injured did think that might be kept for many year perhaps for life in close confinement in case doubtless party must at last accept don carlos a king there must doubt be general search for there must be great trouble when seemed to that must never be found even best friend must be willing to accept don carlos what do think will have taken place at madrid must certainly say madam that when be missed effort will be made by government to keep disappearance secret while attempt will be made in direction to find out mystery will appear almost incredible that carriage horse coachman footman must suddenly mysteriously have disappeared doubt captor did not ride out in body of saw there doubtless remained to destroy carriage possibly others may have waited mile two outside town two perhaps must keep distance ahead of carriage two must follow particular attention must be attracted by carriage with blind down apparently empty being driven through street at leisurely pace after man got out of carriage said queen went very much faster for time wondered way be going where be to be taken a hour after hour went on ceased to trouble over be principally occupied in endeavouring to appease isabella curiosity concerning strange method of travelling by telling story to keep amused a soon a became dark fell asleep with head in lap dozed occasionally waking up when horse be changed when morning came felt that be being ferried across river then in couple of hour arrived here carriage drew up door be opened several gentleman be standing there took off hat a dismounted expressed regret at having given so long fatiguing journey count de monteroy assured that attention must be paid to comfort that must be treated with respect that must be in way intruded upon three time during day servant brought in food be requested to come down to dinner be in mind to refuse thought be better that isabella must have change might learn something of arrangement of house be fortunate indeed that did so for if have be kept prisoner upstairs think that even ingenuity courage must have enabled to obtain interview with coachman have be ordered to take exactly same road a by have come to stop to change horse at same place by way senor be servant who rode with same a accompanied on occasion when rescued count leon de balen sister be majesty be at present riding on box with coachman a have be lamed in fight with carlists although ankle be broken be now nearly healed fatigue of long ride have be so great that took liberty of placing upon box to keep eye on coachman while one of trooper lead horse first time stop beg that will present brave fellow to must have suffered greatly from long ride have doubt that have suffered madam have said nothing about rode with leg loose in stirrup only using other however acknowledged morning that must not sit horse going back said must remain with troop for two day resting be then decided to put on box instead of one of soldier a have intended where did get wounded how if be majesty pleasure will tell be long story if mistake not will be changing horse in short time so have better leave until start again very well regent said longer story better for have long journey before when carriage stopped roper be called to door be man majesty who have ridden from madrid with thank most heartily queen regent said isabella give hand to brave

of doing that regent said be not nobleman madam father be what must call country gentleman living on estate be believe fair one died when be only ten year old left to care of uncle only propose remaining in spain until come of age to inherit estate at what age do inherit generally inherit at twenty one madam father considered very rightly be not of disposition to settle down therefore stated in will be not to come into estate until be twenty five then suppose will not be long before go will be little time yet be good deal younger than look regent smiled be because be so big strong suppose captain hallett be thinking of taking spanish lady home a wife there ought not to have asked said only remember that when certain young lady told story of what have happened to coloured up very prettily when mentioned name there wo say anything more about now a be off again perhaps will tell that story of how follower be wounded arthur told story regent daughter be greatly interested insisted upon hearing much fuller particular than wished to give of manner of escape from cabrera of return to carry off roper wonder man be attached to christina said warmly must be strange indeed if be not be grand action captain hallett however much may make light of now sir own feel sleepy scarcely closed eye last night must mind riding for time certainly not madam be just stopping to put in

bottle of count best wine cold fowl pasty variety of sweet together with glass plate other necessary regent little queen entered into spirit of thing with great zest to former be relief indeed to be eating without ceremony able for moment to put aside care of state weighed so heavily upon to little queen be something perfectly delightful laughed chatted with freedom abandon set arthur quite at ease meal lasted for long time regent declaring that have not eaten so much enjoyed meal so thoroughly for year queen be enchanted why ca always eat like mamma said instead of having to sit up with three four servant to wait upon everyone staring disagreeably do so wish must well ca have quite like isabella will make up mind once week will dine together in closet then will have everything put

always dine with dear captain hallett have other thing to do perhaps sometimes when be in madrid will come a special treat for child nodded contentedly will be very angry with if doe not come often said meal lasted until arrived at next changing place here arthur got out again be glad to regain own horse be just one o'clock when rode into madrid there be light in palace gate be still open did not drive up to principal entrance regent decided that must enter at side door try to make way to apartment unnoticed a be possible that news of disappearance have be kept from most of servant of palace come up with if please captain hallett said door be unbolted after giving order that carriage must be taken round to stable that soldier must put up at inn for night come round for order in morning entered with arthur carrying child sound asleep in arm climbed stair to first floor up to time queen have be in ignorance a to whereabouts now knew where be made way to own chamber leaving arthur outside went in for minute two laid child on bed took off wrap then came out now will go to council chamber said expect will find of minister there in consultation led way along gallery opening door went in eight men be sitting there leapt to foot with cry of astonishment a regent entered followed by young gentleman who be unknown to why majesty minister said yes understand that be surprised to see interrupted now gentleman went on a went to seat at head of table will in first place ask have happened here since have be away after will tell where have be have absence be known to very few people majesty fortunately be here awaiting return a time passed did not arrive became anxious when be two hour late sent for colleague have consultation be unable to form idea of what have become of carriage have not returned be not possible that accident must have occurred for if so must have heard of at nine o'clock became seriously alarmed went out to different part of city to make cautious enquiry a to where carriage have be last seen whether report be current that accident have taken place met here again at eleven none of have heard of news carriage have be seen in various part of town early in afternoon where have be last noticed must not find out set whole police to search quietly one be told of disappearance search be made for carriage in meantime be given out that queen be unwell that be remaining with nursing majesty surgeon be called in sworn to secrecy have twice day come to palace have be a majesty may well imagine at wit end to know what to do to announce that have disappeared must cause disturbance in city enormous state of unrest throughout kingdom have met to night to consider how long secret must be kept whether must be expedient at once to offer very large reward for news concerning happily duke be in position to settle matter to relieve disquietude then related how have be kidnapped how be taken to house of count de monterey confined there many be exclamation of anger a went on be monstrous incredible be among exclamation when ceased then how madam did obtain freedom from hand of malefactor must certainly seem that have taken precaution to keep place of confinement secret precaution did take must have deceived most people regent said happily failed to deceive gentleman here now captain hallett perhaps will please tell gentleman how happened that traced rescued request that will tell in full detail thus commanded arthur gave full account of way in suspicion have be aroused of pursuit manner in have discovered that suspicion be correct step have taken to obtain release of prisoner well sir premier said when arthur have brought story to conclusion have to congratulate most heartily in own name on behalf of other member of majesty government upon manner in have rescued queen queen regent from hand of captor have shown amount of acuteness of steadfastness of purpose of courage in venturing into den of conspirator doe extraordinary amount of credit can hardly imagine what must have happened have place of confinement of queen remained undiscovered whole kingdom must have be in uproar civil strife must have be more rampant than ever thank most heartily in name of spain for what have done for have list senor of men who have be arrested yes senor be premier ran eye over passed on to colleague be difficult to believe said that of gentleman here mentioned must have be engaged in such conspiracy however can not at present decide upon so important question may say senor christina said that for own part must vastly prefer that there must be scandal trial prefer that must be ordered to leave kingdom at once with understanding that if return will be arrested on charge of high treason must be most unfortunate if matter must be made public plot have failed mere fact that have be tried might lead others to repeat attempt in next place most of men who have be engaged in matter bear historic name have wide connection must therefore be one of gravest scandal ever known in spanish history be to be tried punished on charge be opinion on subject submit to judgment think that when come to take into consideration magnitude of interest involved will agree with that must be advisable to let matter pas unnoticed in time when trouble be brought to end will be possible to extend to conspirator hand of mercy allow to return to such portion of estate a may be deemed fitting now gentleman will leave have have four day of great fatigue anxiety must say that to morrow notification must be issued to effect that queen have recovered from passing indisposition that in course of day must show in street a usual so saying rose member of council also stood up bowed deeply a left room followed by arthur

room with closed shutter two men be standing on guard at door of course took for one of master guest walked coolly past found in room queen mother got regent to sign order have written out for officer commanding at tudela to place under order then rode over there fetched squadron of cavalry arrived at daybreak surrounded house took twelve men there prisoner started hour later with queen arrived here at one o'clock morning leon gazed at in open eyed astonishment be certainly most surprising fellow most astonishing fellow know what to say to here single handed have thwarted plot might have brought ruin to country have saved couple of queen have captured too leader of plot have ridden what with journey to tudela back four hundred mile at least in course of three day half here be telling a if have be natural everyday occurrence certainly be not everyday occurrence leon be affair might have happened to anyone who kept eye open possessed certain amount of endurance so be real history of young queen indisposition yes think minister acted very wisely in keeping thing secret be first wise thing have done leon said see that be bit better than last ministry however never mind that now about must be fearfully stiff be very stiff will wear off by to morrow did man perform marvellous journey in spite of broken leg rode there with when went to fetch troop came back on box of queen carriage leg hurt good deal last night hope real harm be done though doubt will have to keep quiet for few day well ought to make duke grandee of spain of for sincerely hope wo think of anything of sort arthur laughed fancy going back to england with such title a duc de miraflores thing must be absolutely ludicrous well will have to do something big anyhow leon said now tell story more fully have got nothing to do may a well gratify curiosity there be really very little to tell will give to then told story in detail well be really remarkable that must have be able to keep under observation during long journey without letting know that be followed see must have have idea that there be anyone after if have must no doubt have left couple of number to follow at distance of two three mile doubt felt quite sure that absence of queen be entirely unsuspected that search must be made for for at least six hour assuredly party must be sent off in case to scour country till next day by time must have crossed ebro if instead of taking horse from queen carriage have waited five minute till own be yoked plot must have be successful plan be uncommonly well laid must hardly have conceived possible that one of queen horse must be recognized in private carriage must have be have not happened to observe peculiar mark very morning well leon said will be off now to tell sister will not stir out to day leon really feel must enjoy day rest be possible may be sent for to palace be almost certain minister must have many thing to question about a queen last night can only have given general account of affair indeed court messenger rode up hour later requested arthur attendance at palace dressed fully went there on arrival be conducted to council chamber queen have not yet risen captain hallett must be glad if must give much fuller detail than regent be able to give last night perhaps too in addition to what yourself know of may have heard from queen christina particular of capture arthur gave particular at full length of queen capture of own proceeding thank captain premier said be most audacious attempt against person of queen of spain have ever heard of manner in thwarted be le remarkable have already despatched courier with order to colonel queredo ordering to bring prisoner to madrid under escort of troop of cavalry to accomplish with possible speed placing in three carriage keeping most careful guard over confining by day in suitable apartment where can communicate with one travelling after dark only will be tried privately may tell that although life be unquestionably forfeited intend to carry out extreme penalty a must not be done without whole affair becoming known matter that be most anxious to avoid in first place men be member of good family must not be so disposed of without whole matter being known attempt so nearly succeeded that might be again tried estate will of course be forfeited will be taken to frontier forbidden ever to cross again under penalty of incurring death sentence will be passed upon now sir may ask what shape must like gratitude to take for great service have rendered have desire for reward in shape sir arthur replied be english gentleman with estate in own country be well pleased have be able to render service to queen of spain mother be ample reward for effort can assure that will be best pleased if nothing else be done in matter feel personally thankful to that have decided not to execute men concerned in matter must be pain for to know that life of twelve men who be doubtless actuated by what believed however mistakenly to be good of country must be forfeited through may enquire if have arrested coachman footman ask that mercy must be extended to be of course bribed heavily think punishment too severe for men who must so betray mistress police be in search of captain hallett can hardly expect to find for time for must naturally leave within hour after perpetration of crime a have four day start will by time be far away effort however will be spared in tracing a to what have said will of course inform regent of declaration doubtless doe highest credit a must see can hardly be entertained by a must be impossible for queen to remain under so deep obligation to gentleman however honourable disinterested well sir can only say that spoke in earnest will always be pleased to look back at having be able to render service to queen of spain who have already honoured by creating knight of isabella of first class companion of order of san fernando catholic be again sent for to palace by queen afternoon have be for drive with daughter said have be acclaimed by populace who be evidently pleased that isabella have recovered from indisposition thing will now hope go on a before feel that at present have not thanked a deserve for what did for believe that be not ungrateful little daughter be not old enough to understand service have rendered in name thank most deeply will ever retain deep feeling of obligation towards service be one that gentleman might have performed sight of carriage with blind down knowledge that one of horse be drawing belonged to majesty might well have excited suspicion in anyone that something be wrong that idea once entertained must have taken step to get to bottom of mystery regent smiled can assure captain hallett that few of countryman must have troubled head about matter one way have put out of way to investigate premier tell that have informed of course intend to take a to traitor have approval entirely so be very little qualified to judge such matter certainly seems to in highest degree desirable that attempt on person must not be generally known people may guess a choose when hear that men have be banished for life may merely suppose that have be concerned in plot other anything must be better than to let be known that have be actually carried off that evening arthur paid visit to leon be received with enthusiasm by three girl leon have be telling about doings senor arthur inez exclaimed so have saved two queen brought safely back from madrid be splendid ca tell how proud feel of a flatter that be greatest friend here that certainly be donna inez have very intimate friend here except yourselves a for mercedes regularly cried girl went on must not tell such thing inez mercedes said colouring hotly know that be silly of did seem so brave so wonderful there be bravery in only time when there be ever real danger be when entered house discovered queen otherwise question be only one of sitting so many hour in saddle wo have belittle mercedes said with attempt at playfulness be just same thing when rescued tried to make out that anyone must have done be altogether splendid deed in short time guest began to arrive for be evening on entertained arthur must not help being amused at talk turned partly on young queen illness rapid recovery what must have happened have illness be serious one week later arthur appeared at trial of traitor gave evidence a to proceeding christina account of capture be read aloud prisoner attempted defence a complicity of whole of in affair be too evident to dispute be sentenced to death with confiscation of estate death sentence however be commuted by queen regent into banishment for life be taken to frontier there released on day after trial estate of count de monteroy be bestowed upon arthur by decree signed by queen regent queen went at once to palace to receive document implored regent to take back gift have intention majesty of remaining in spain after conclusion of war gift must be burden to must not look after estate see to welfare of tenant hope that in time when matter be settled majesty will be able to recall unhappy men replace on estate doubtless amnesty will be granted at end of war trust that majesty will be able to include even malefactor who will may be sure be moved by clemency to become faithful servant of yours queen can not be ungrateful cavalero majesty be sufficient for to know have gratitude will always be proud to know have be able to do daughter service therefore implore to take back gift can not refuse petition from regent said taking deed of gift in hand tore in two in way at least must manifest gratitude three day later arthur received business notification from banker in city stating that sum of hundred thousand crown have be paid by royal order to account five thousand crown to of soldier john roper felt that must not refuse gift called at palace sincerely thanked two queen for feel will always feel that be under deepest obligation to senor have be permitted to show very small portion of roper be in highest degree delighted have now thrown away stick be able to walk fairly well well captain hallett said never thought when sailed on expedition from liverpool must come home at end of few year with fifteen hundred pound in pocket when sat down to dinner on board hulk that through be to have such good fortune must not put in way roper have come to through friendship led to give up stripe in order to follow for service did in affair in be engaged together be mighty little did beyond following order now sir care how soon go back to england do roper must see business out from what hear maroto don carlos ' commander in chief in north who appears to be unmixed scoundrel be negotiating with espartero for surrender have already seized murdered six of carlists best general who must knew be opposed to project if negotiation fall through there be end to carlist cause in north espartero will be able to move with whole force into aragon in case will speedily bring contest to end week later arthur be at reception at leon when observed man scowling at asking name from friend learned that be count silvio de mora thought no more of matter at time on following morning card with name of don pedro de verderas be brought in to at once ordered roper to show up young man entered bowed courteously waved hand aside when arthur offered chair have come to senor on part of friend count silvio de mora who conceives to be seriously aggrieved by indeed sir in what way have never exchanged word with be aware of though certainly observed that be looking unpleasantly at last night count grievance be very clear distinct one senor be a be doubtless aware betrothed to donna mercedes de balen that young lady a consequence tell of being captured by carlists wrote by hand of brother to say that shock have be so great that be determined never to marry to spend life in good work count friend assented though deeply troubled by decision count now find that by common report donna mercedes stay sir arthur said sternly let name of donna mercedes de balen be brought into matter count silvio de mora conceives that have quarrel with demand satisfaction be quite enough a between two gentleman will be perfectly prepared to give satisfaction friend of mine will wait upon to arrange preliminary nothing can be more satisfactory spaniard said arthur exchanged deep bow went out arthur sat down to think deeply be now twenty with experience made feel year older donna mercedes be year younger gradually for long time past have be aware of fact that be more than friendship brought about by close intimacy that felt towards be in respect charming girl be bright pleasant natural one of acknowledged beauty of madrid have often told that must be wrong of to presume on friendship of count leon to raise eye to sister who be co heiress with sister to large estate have be property of mother queen remark about blush when mentioned have often recurred to have suggested to that possibly be not mere gratitude felt for queen gift have placed in better position than before so that must not be necessary to ask to wait five year before must be able to support in style of life to have be accustomed have be intimate with family in manner altogether contrary to spanish custom might well be that have come to care for well will speak to brother about after affair be over concluded now will send word to don lopez parona have seen good deal of doubt will act for sent roper off with note hour later young man came in don lopez said count silvio de mora have forced quarrel upon be necessary must fight have sent for to ask if will be second in affair with pleasure captain hallett what arrangement do wish made well have be thinking over pretend to be really good shot with pistol though have practised bit do know whether count be good swordsman have reputation of being excellent one well took lesson with sword four year ago when be at vittoria have never used straight sword since suppose be better shot with pistol than be wish to say have not touched sword for year that if will give fortnight to practise will choose that weapon if object to will take pistol fenced for nearly six month at vittoria worked very hard master said that be really good swordsman have learned a much a spaniard must in two year think with hard work can get back again in fortnight three hour later don lopez returned have arranged a desired seems count know nothing of pistol be quite willing to give fortnight to prepare for encounter very well then will go evening to fencing school will put in six hour work day divided into three lesson of two hour must be prodigious senor if feel muscle will think admit that can stand pretty hard work arthur went to man who be considered to be first teacher of fencing in madrid arranged to go to three time day at eight in morning at two in afternoon at seven in evening master at first said that must be impossible for to practise for so long time well at rate professor will try be quite possible that for first three four day will have to rest bit sometimes think at end of fortnight will be able to work six hour day without difficulty arthur took off coat waistcoat turned up shirt sleeve by san martin have wonderful arm professor said play hard at school in england game demand strength activity be not wonderful that muscle be vastly harder stronger than of gentleman who must consider infra dig when boy to engage in sport must make warm professor felt muscle of right arm well senor if fence a muscle must seem to show need only little teaching to be one of best swordsman in spain then too height age give great advantage well senor take foil let see what know very good said after bout of two three minute have be well taught can see that be out of practice return be not a quick a might be however if work a say will soon be put right after lesson arthur found wrist recovering suppleness be glad to stop before second bout be finished will do senor professor said when acknowledged that have have enough suppose be working in way for purpose can tell must be sorry to be opponent arthur wrist arm be stiff next morning be not sorry to follow teacher advice content with hour half at lesson first week leon in vain endeavoured to find out from where have spent time used almost always to find in said now whether be morning afternoon find away of evening have often dropped in later than usual be rather busy just now leon of course go in morning from ten to one to colonel wylde office generally for hour in afternoon thing be so quiet up in north east that doe not consider necessary for to start again at present well girl be always saying have come over captain hallett last few day tell please that nothing have come over have work keep particularly busy in ten day will have brought to conclusion arthur have doubt that antagonist have not altogether thrown away time that too have be practising thought that in probability be confined to little dilettante work lasting perhaps for hour day at end of fortnight professor announced that never in experience have seen so strong arm so supple wrist that believed arthur must easily hold own against even strongest antagonist be considered good blade said during past two three day have with difficulty held own with indeed have hit oftener than have hit so now have done with yes professor be greatly indebted to for time have spent upon trouble have taken professor shrugged shoulder have paid well for senor have be real pleasure to teacher be always interested in pupil when be fortunate enough to have pupil like doe not care what trouble bestows upon fencing have be revelation to of what countryman can do speak not of skill of power to sustain fatigue when compare senor earnestness strength of muscle quickness of wrist with work of young noble cavalier who come to flatter that be learning to fence can well understand why englishman be such great soldier why spread yourselves over world conquer three century ago men of race be great soldier be strong hardy conquered well nigh europe till unfortunately for fell across from time downfall began fought against in holland fought with huguenot king of navarre at ivry fought with on sea destroyed armada captured cadiz demolished mercantile marine a must seem broke spirit of people for from time have steadily gone down make one sad to think of chapter xvi engaged on morning of fifteenth day after arthur have received count silvio challenge two second met arranged for duel to take place at distance of mile from town be to be at seven in morning so that there must be fear of interruption of gentleman be provided with piece of string length of sword of principal be found to be a nearly a possible same length be agreed that count must bring surgeon with that other save second must be present at encounter don lopez went round to arthur chamber hour before time to start arthur have night before told roper of what be going to happen given instruction a to disposal of horse take anything like roper what money have will be in desk may take to pay for journey home will want a sent to england sum have in bank have fear captain that will have to take such step feel sure that spaniard be match for ca know certainly have reason to believe so if came to downright hard hitting fancy must hold own against most spaniard in fencing be different thing be not question of strength only by long way of spaniard be good hardy men captain doubt very few of will be found among gentry who pas day in sleeping dawdling about smoking cigarette drinking coffee well suppose sir there be harm in going out taking up place where can see what go on none at roper have doubt that count will have number of friend to look on be sure expects to run through without trouble will like to show off prowess before friend drove in carriage to place fixed upon for encounter a arthur have expected score two of gentleman have collected near spoke to second who went up to of antagonist said principal understood that matter be to be kept private that none must be informed of be repeated to count who shrugged shoulder said mentioned to few friend doubt told others make difference illustration little by little arthur advance accelerated arthur pressed lip tightly together when answer be repeated to want performance to be seen eh muttered perhaps will be sorry have got so many witness before have done preliminary be speedily settled two antagonist removed coat waistcoat faced other count began with few preliminary flourish intended to show off swordsmanship how lightly thought of encounter be fully head shorter than antagonist latter much longer reach must have given decided advantage have be equal in other respect arthur stood firmly on guard contenting with putting aside almost contemptuously other play waited till count steadied down began in earnest then to astonishment of antagonist took offensive in vain latter tried to get within point in vain exerted to utmost springing in out with scarce movement of wrist arthur point played in little menacing circle there be fierce lunge to be turned aside opening left to be taken advantage of steadily arthur advanced foot by foot antagonist have to give way in vain count exerted to utmost perspiration streamed from face expression changed from that of contemptuous superiority to rage uneasiness again again count felt that adversary be playing with that avoided taking advantage of opening have be left opponent face be grave earnest without other emotion little by little arthur advance be accelerated in vain spaniard attempted to stand ground against menacing point in spite of greatest effort have to give way be driven backwards across green sward on encounter be taking place till be close to boundary then there be sudden wrench sword be sent flying through air arthur lowered point said in quiet deliberate voice must be heard by astonished spectator seem to be little out of breath senor perhaps must like to wait for three four minute before begin again count white with rage shame walked picked up sword now senor arthur went on after pause of two three minute will recommence affair hitherto have played with now warn that will run through shoulder when get to other side of field again singular scene began in vain count endeavoured to circle round foe in vain tried to arrest own steady retreat move a must to change position arthur with long stride quick spring always kept in front of in quarter of hour be driven back across field then for first time arthur lunged antagonist sword dropped useless by side a ran through upper part of arm shoulder may perhaps serve a lesson to count not to pick quarrel gratuitously with stranger of whose force be unacquainted life have be in hand hundred time have chosen to avail myself of opening did not wish seriously to injure have brought number of gentleman here to day to witness triumph trust that have be amused so saying turned walked back to spot where have left clothes put on entered carriage with second beckoning to roper who be standing short distance away to get up on box truly have astounded don lopez said thought that with height length of arm must give trouble exhibition a be never seen burst into fit of laughter count wo be able to show face in madrid again for know not how long wound to body be nothing that to pride be terrible will never hear end of to think that be driven right across field a if have be pig under peasant goad without possibility of stopping that must have be disarmed played with be too funny of course thing will get about over madrid will have to be careful though don arthur how go out after dark may find with dagger between shoulder must scarcely be in human nature for man to put up with being made public laughing stock without trying to get revenge certainly don silvio be not from what know of likely to be exception to rule yes doubt will have to be careful suppose one can buy such thing a shirt of link armour in madrid oh yes there be plenty of to be picked up in shop where keep old weapon curiosity good one cost money though money be nothing arthur said if one get thing one want to have a good one at same time a light one a money can buy must mind getting one for must rather not be seen buying such thing with pleasure will make tour of shop where be likely to keep such thing pick out best can find for be hard if manage to get one by evening although think be safe for few day for be found stabbed now everyone must put down to don silvio at once must say that must hardly attempt such thing in madrid be likely to be in much greater danger when go off to join army again yes think must be case still must rather not risk beginning at once quite right certainly must not if be in place on reaching apartment arthur sat down to breakfast with friend not until latter have left did roper make allusion to scene have witnessed now captain hallett said on returning to room after letting visitor out what did tell must be stayed at distance roared with laughter be funniest thing ever saw to see dancing with rage pushing steadily backwards with scarcely movement of sword be worse than fight once saw in street of liverpool one of bullying fellow who stand at corner of street insult passer by pushed against quiet looking chap be passing well sir happened to be noted prize fighter way gave that fellow pepper be worth walking good many mile to see there be fear of having to fight duel while be out here think not roper at same time will have to be careful when spaniard can not get revenge other way sometimes hire assassin to put dagger between enemy shoulder well sir must take to going out with must not be out after dark be going to have even better guard than must be have asked don lopez to get shirt of mail people used to wear good deal in olden time feel that will be safer for using one for bit will be good plan sir still at same time might be advisable for to keep near may a well be doing that a anything else if there be to be sticking with knife must like to have hand in very well roper at rate can walk with when be going anywhere of course can not tell always at what hour may be returning must not like to keep waiting about for hour oh must tell hour before must not be leaving captain then must be at hand at time may a well smoke pipe there a anywhere else chance be must always find someone to talk to three hour later leon came in what be have be doing said excitedly have be to club nothing else be being talked about duel between count silvio de mora say be strangest fight ever seen that drove across meadow then disarmed told to get breath then drove back again finally after sparing fifty time ran through shoulder be about fact of case arthur replied quietly must have be very glad if nothing have be said about affair arranged that one second surgeon must be present instead of that count chose to tell thirty forty of friend doubt thought to make example of consequence be a say that affair have got over town to great annoyance be quarrel about be about private matter must rather that did not ask to tell more enough that forced upon dear arthur seems to that must affect why must count have fixed quarrel upon if have forced one upon on account of mercedes throwing over year ago must not have be surprised though know why must have done so a appeared to have taken dismissal in very good part why must quarrel with because be fancy suppose leon tut tut other said warmly seems to that be matter concern family must really ask dear arthur to tell frankly how occurred arthur sat silent for minute well leon may a well ask question now must have asked shortly have long loved sister mercedes have refrained from speaking for three reason in first place because be very young have chosen to laugh at when said so in point of fact be only twenty only twenty leon said incredulously have always taken to be a old a myself have told be not so repeat be not yet twenty be therefore only year older than sister second reason have regarded a more serious be englishman must necessarily take home if married in third place be not in position pecuniarily to ask to be wife until be five twenty came into estate last of reason have ceased to exist by having received from queen present of one hundred thousand crown for service rendered have begged very strongly not to offer reward for service christina said that be impossible for to remain under so great obligation to in spite of must have still refused if found must not do so have handed over money for benefit of poor thought that must at least remove one of obstacle stood in way of asking for sister hand decided in accepting a must enable to keep in position similar to have held at home until come into estate that estate be worth at father death about one thousand english pound year then there be of course good house ground accumulation of income during past ten year will have amounted to sum must enable to double size of estate therefore have only first two difficulty be for to decide whether be insuperable so leon ask now for hand of sister can promise if grant consent will do in power to make happy leon rose grasped arthur by hand nothing can give greater pleasure clear fellow than to grant request have made will of course be sorry to lose england be not so far from spain doubt not that will bring over to see sometimes sister may even visit occasionally in england there be one to whom must so gladly see united for have fairly won saved from death have ever since hoped that day must claim a to feeling can of course say nothing be not altogether blind have long be evident to that think of one a to money be secondary matter though say that be not advantage that must have income of own not owe everything to have however not inadequate portion a mother be only daughter wealthy heiress fortune will be divided between three sister share must amount roughly to seven eight thousand crown year there be one drawback to match be difference of religion know how bigoted spaniard be allow protestant place of worship to exist save only private chapel of ambassador priesthood will move heaven earth to prevent marriage taking place indeed seems to that only plan will be for to take to england for to be married there however obstacle be not serious one in eye that be protestant be amply sufficient to show that there be a good men of one religion a of well will come with at once will come evening leon must rather have not be settled to day when have just be engaged in shedding blood however be not fault will be alone evening yes so far a know then will come in after dinner be more nervous about than be before meeting count silvio see have so long made up mind be man have be thinking still feel that be only boy nonsense arthur stand over six foot have strength of two ordinary spaniard have accomplished marvel won gratitude of queen be perfectly ridiculous for to talk in way well then will expect evening mercedes girl have gone out morning doubt will in course of visit have heard of prowess to day will be good introduction although think will be surprised in way a confidence in ability to do anything undertake be absolute don lopez came in late that afternoon have seen quite perfect coat of mail said be made for bishop of toledo who have many enemy be hundred fifty year old be very light can withstand dagger thrust be dear man want five hundred crown for declares that will not take penny le thank lopez will suit admirably will give order for sum will ask to send round to in morning arthur be very nervous when started that evening for count leon still felt in many respect boy in spite of leon report felt hardly possible that donna mercedes must have come to love dressed in evening suit with unusual care did not start till last moment be shown up into drawing room a usual mercedes two sister be in room have to quarrel with former said laughingly hear that have be cruelly ill treating gentleman in whom have once great interest not only ill treating turning into laughing stock now senor demand that tell what be about why have thus assailed gentleman to whom a know be once much attached be much attached to donna mercedes well said pouting know be affianced to by own wish senora well never mind about own wish said be quite sufficient be almost affianced to now demand from again true complete history how came about well said can hardly expect senora must go into particular of kind before sister young lady who can not be horrified by deed of violence mercedes laughed well will tell day wo what be about why so ill treated hear that will not be able to show face for time in madrid will tell be good for to learn said in tone of banter know that must be grieving terribly over of course be dreadfully girl said when heard how have be treating almost made up mind not to speak to again ah here be leon looking a serious a judge leon came up to mercedes to surprise took by hand little sister said have very serious duty to perform have have request for hand girl turned pale know said that intend to marry leon have told so over over again that may be so sister believe that lady change mind in matter not infrequently gentleman who be suitor be not unknown to be of good blood honourable position will perhaps anticipate name be cavalero captain arthur hallett knight of isabella of first class companion of order of fernando catholic girl face have be set with mutinous expression changed suddenly deep wave of colour rushed over face head drooped have willing consent to alliance mercedes indeed know of one in world to whom must so willingly commit happiness know senora arthur said that be very unworthy of so great gift at least can promise to do best to make happy girl lifted head suddenly say that be unworthy said be who must say have not saved from death have not saved spain from being ruined be who feel above thing honoured by love then leon said with slight smile think that there be occasion for to lay order upon on subject take arthur can trust happiness in hand with certainty that confidence will not be abused gave hand to arthur who bent down kissed two younger girl clapped hand loudly oh arthur inez exclaimed will never call don arthur again be pleased always knew that mercedes be fond of anyone must have seen that with eye did not know what felt towards be pleased can not tell how much believe be more pleased than be now madcap brother said suppose two come in with to next room let leave two young people alone did really doubt that loved mercedes said short time afterwards have be so afraid of showing too much after being carried in arm that journey knew must never marry anyone else if have not asked for before went away must have assuredly gone into convent hour later others returned to room held long conversation together be finally agreed in view of opposition must be raised by spanish clergy on ground of difference of religion that engagement must be kept quiet for time that thing must go on a be can not be many month before war be over leon said will be returning to england will necessarily be away great deal will avoid much trouble argument if assent to matter being kept quiet mercedes arthur agreed that must be better so a felt sure that there must be vehement opposition on part of clergy if member of noble family contracted marriage with heretic to arthur surprise when called next morning mercedes who received alone said with flush good morning arthur in english looked at with surprise do mean to say that understand english mercedes have be learning for past year said in imperfect english with pretty accent loved arthur after have saved so loved everything english a have plenty of time upon hand have spent two hour day ever since in learning have difficulty in finding mistress for several english family settled in town after last war thought perhaps that must come in useful mercedes did not quite like to think that said glancing at seemed to perhaps a loved so much might day come to love never quite thought so know must not help sometimes hoping anyhow sir be quite enough for that be reason have learned english now when be together alone must always talk with want to get to speak quite perfectly before go to england meet friend really talk very fairly now said must not be in least afraid that anyone will find fault with suppose have heard leon said few day later that don silvio be still in madrid say will see one will feel rather glad when be gone leon be evidently revengeful fellow be quite clear by way in fixed quarrel upon wo do anything think be quite capable of hiring ruffian to put out of way know that plenty of unprincipled character be to be found in city who must willingly do job for few dollar have doubt about be intending to speak seriously to on subject thing be still very quiet dare say colonel must send to one other of army if be to ask be not at disposed to go until be obliged to be enjoying great deal too much for have taken precaution roper come with evening to house meet at door when go away moreover have bought shirt of mail be splendid example of best sort of work of kind have put on table tried to drive knife through striking with force simply broke weapon did not injure chain put on now whenever go out after dark be very glad to hear amount of strength bravery can save man from hand of assassin good mail shirt be worth score of guard for man who bides time will always find chance sooner later be how look at can assure that be far too happy at present time to be willing to throw away smallest chance three day later don lopez called at arthur room have heard morning that don silvio have gone out of town now will have to look to so long a be here considered that be safe for if anything happened to suspicion must at once fall upon now that be away people might suspect a much a liked must be extremely difficult to bring matter home to must hardly think will do anything more in matter arthur said think contrary lopez replied if have simply met wounded thing might have passed off quietly must have shown that be better swordsman there must have be end of have made laughing stock of town will be joke against life that be driven about like sheep by man whom boasted be going to kill like dog will never get over one must stand such disgrace with equanimity of course be infinitely worse for man a proud a touchy about family a be will look out think precaution will be of much value if man want to stab be sure to find opportunity sooner later however have coat of mail rely more upon than on vigilance on part on roper two day later when arthur be returning home from leon two men sprang out from dark entry struck at back sharp exclamation broke from a instead of knife burying to hilt struck on hard substance arthur be nearly knocked down by force of blow springing round seized men by throat before must recover from surprise roper who be walking ten pace in rear rushed up all right roper have got arthur cried squeezing throat dashed head together with strength two three time with result that a released hold fell to ground insensible think will walk on roper must have pretty nearly broken skull to say nothing of half choking if be to give into custody must be endless affair might be kept here for month will certainly not repeat experiment attempt don silvio may make next will not be in same direction next morning told leon of what have happened know whether did right to let go arthur there be nothing to prevent fellow from trying again in other way must there have be if have given into custody may be sure that bribe must be large enough to secure silence a to who have employed must simply have declared that only attacked to obtain possession of valuable might have about don silvio be rich be hundred to one before trial came on men must have escaped hundred pound must bribe jailer in spain if by accident failed must bribe judge so that nothing must ever come out against villain who set men on might be kept dancing attendance on court for month be true enough arthur still matter must be kept hanging over head until be settled must be hardly likely to make attempt upon however need not discus now that have let fellow go scot free have not let go scot free can assure in first place nearly strangled in second be by mean sure that did not fracture skull that sort of man have got very hard skull leon answered probably must have fractured mine if have dashed against somebody else with muscular arm of yours have doubt whether head of professional bravo must not stand even blow a wo say with impunity at least without very serious damage say anything to mercedes about must only fidget can assure doe not disquiet mail shirt have indisputably proved that be knife proof when don silvio receives report from two gentleman will see that attempt to dispose of in way will be in vain give credit for ingenuity be quite possible will hit upon other idea however trust that will be able to meet be indeed will be somewhat interested to see what next plan may be what do say arthur to mentioning affair at club saying loudly have doubt whatever be outcome of duel with dear leon must simply entail challenging man really doe fence badly be only superior length of arm sheer strength overbore must refuse to fight leon said think must certainly must not like to do so may feel perfectly convinced that attack upon last night be work have absolute proof of fact that beat in duel simply show that be much better swordsman than be be reflection upon character so see if be to bring accusation against without having shadow of real proof doubt if must refuse to meet see man have large circle of friend relative posse much influence be willing to accept a brother in law although just at present town have laugh against must not prevent friend from rallying round be to bring terrible accusation against a of setting assassin on suppose not leon said regretfully know arthur feel more grateful to than ever for be evident now that not only saved mercedes from death from marriage with man of whose real character be altogether ignorant how grieved must have be have be tied to man who must assuredly have shown in true colour sooner later yes have certainly have narrow escape leon though can not help thinking that in case must have learned more of before marriage came off leon shook head see how must bore very respectable character indeed be thought highly of that must have picked quarrel with be not altogether unnatural in circumstance really attempt upon life be only thing have against be thousand pity now that instead of treating a did did not run through have done with know that have made much difference leon have a say powerful friend connection whereas if have fallen in duel with other noble of own rank must have thought more of matter must certainly have attempted to avenge death if foreigner heretic have killed church count for great deal believe be very rigid catholic therefore chance be that there must have be terrible row over might have have to leave kingdom in present circumstance must be particularly disagreeable to well perhaps be right leon said really unfortunate part of affair be that must have taken into head to resent fact that mercedes did not keep to resolution of remaining single perhaps going into convent did not guarantee that must leon know in letter wrote signed certainly gave to understand that broke on engagement on term yes be so imagine that young lady have right to change mind without being called to account for yes be very well see gentleman have also sort of right to resent well be useless to say more about have let fellow go whether for good evil matter be concluded a far a be concerned chapter xvii kidnapped priest be sitting at table in second class cafe when gentleman entered came up to table good morning count priest said received note asking to meet at place here be thanks father other said a took seat beside ordered coffee waited till be brought then went on wanted to see about rather delicate matter concern may say church priest looked surprised be know count went on spiritual adviser of count leon de balen family can hardly say of count priest said with smile for like too many young nobleman of age doe not trouble with confession of lady yes may ask if donna mercedes come very often to confession well son unless ask for very particular reason be question must not care to answer there be ring of dissatisfaction in priest answer that count be not slow to notice have reason for asking said know father be at one time will not say actually betrothed very nearly so to donna mercedes broke off affair under plea that have made up mind to remain single to devote to good work so told priest said highly approved of determination may ask father if have repeated that statement to of late have not come to frequently of late priest said in tone showed be sore point with thought so count went on well father can hardly help noticing that for time past young english adventurer have be frequently at house priest nodded be friend of brother be matter have regretted a have considered that so close intimacy with heretic be not seemly can not affect donna mercedes must say father that doe very seriously have information of what take place in house can assure that if not already engaged be certain that donna mercedes will be betrothed to adventurer before long priest uttered angry exclamation must be grave scandal terrible scandal said for daughter of noble house to be betrothed to heretic serious loss to church too count said smoothly if marriage must be prevented doubtless must revert to previous intention of entering convent need hardly say that be heiress that revenue must be better employed in church than by young heretic priest nodded fact be too evident to need argument have done best to prevent count went on by challenging young upstart to duel a may perhaps have heard proved better swordsman have therefore resolved to lay matter frankly before in order that may if choose put stop to what a say must be grievous scandal see how must do so priest said gloomily must be useless for to speak to brother who be most to blame for must not have permitted so close intimacy to arise do think must succeed with donna mercedes be regret to say of somewhat headstrong disposition have more than once spoken to about strange intimacy between brother gentleman who be at once foreigner heretic have always replied that be matter on must speak to brother not to a be who have brought to house once when tried to press matter said in tone be not altogether seemly that have saved life a of course have heard though for part doubt whether cabrera must have carried threat into execution that certainly must not take step to induce brother to close door to visit father did not think for moment that persuasion must turn unhappy girl from course on seems to be bent what then do propose be willing to take step must put stop to deplorable state of thing well father know that although laxity have be shown of late year law against infidelity to church be still in force be so said young man be appears agent of government though must assuredly use law against native must scarcely put in force against commissioner of friendly country foresaw count said what can not be done openly can be done privately there can be little doubt that if young adventurer be shut up in cell in monastery for few year donna mercedes when trace of be lost must revert to original intention enter convent in case property must go to church priest be silent for time be daring plan said one of certainly must not approve did see other way of saving unfortunate girl from eternal perdition must doubtless befall be to marry english stranger doubt must in time adopt religion must think over must be grave step to take if be to be discovered might cause serious scandal at same time something might be risked for sake of young lady eternal welfare think that risk must be worth taking into consideration count said there must be plenty of cell in monastery where must be confined without smallest fear of discovery must of course be well treated after donna mercedes have taken veil might even be released on taking oath never to divulge where have be to make complaint a to treatment must doubtless be glad enough to regain liberty on term when disappeared suspicion must naturally fall upon for be well known have great cause of complaint against people must say that have have quietly removed grievous suspicion to have to bear must do so cheerfully in order to save donna mercedes from young adventurer whom brother have so foolishly incautiously allowed to lead away have doubt that will be watched for long time assuredly suspicion must fall upon church of having come to lady rescue certainly marriage to heretic must be terrible scandal priest said one to be avoided by possible mean well son will think over will lay matter before higher authority will meet here again in few day time when will probably be able to give answer good father feel at rate have only done duty in endeavouring to save young lady whom sincerely esteem respect although there be no longer relation between appeared to that be matter in church must interfere having now laid before feel that conscience be relieved have further interest in matter see son that opinion be entirely disinterested one that be acting simply in interest of young lady of holy church count priest met again two day later son matter have be decided upon have laid before bishop agrees with that be incumbent on church to take mean to prevent young lady from going to eternal perdition monastery in young man will be confined have be settled upon perhaps can tell best way in can be secured for be assuredly man of exceptional strength not likely to suffer to be carried away without severe struggle be so father matter be not without difficulty count said after nightfall never go out without being attended by pestilent knave servant two must not be overcome without veritable battle must therefore be taken in daytime if like father will undertake that part of business although be not to be done without difficulty danger must be enticed by fictitious message to quiet house here six men will be waiting for a soon a enters will fling upon overpower will then bind leave then when be dark carriage stretcher carried by four lay brother of monastery can come for carry off make little difference to whither must rather not know so that may be able to swear have not seen since day met that be wholly ignorant of whereabouts if will be here day at hour will come tell when bird be caged so be son indeed will feel grateful to for service will have rendered church next morning arthur received following letter senor hallett writer of letter have become aware of plot against certain young lady in whom have great interest if will call on at twelve o'clock will be awaiting on second etage of number strada de barcelona first door to right prays to be silent a to rendezvous a life must be forfeited be known that have made communication to street be central one largely frequented so no thought entered arthur mind that there must be danger in attending at rendezvous accordingly at quarter to twelve left house carrying however brace of pistol in pocket on arriving at place indicated passed through open doorway ascended stair to second floor then rang bell of door to right be opened by little old woman come in senor said be expected entered closed door behind led way to inner room be about to go in when there be rush of footstep behind four men flung suddenly on to back weight impetus of charge throwing forward on to face before must recover from surprise attempt to struggle rope be thrown over head pulled down to elbow then tightened in minute be bound helpless be carried into room knot more securely fastened wrist being bound tightly behind back ankle lashed together then two of men left room others remained sitting with knife in hand arthur cursed own folly in not having let roper know where be going yet a told be natural that having be informed that plot affected mercedes must have kept matter to that have fallen into power of count silvio did not doubt for moment yet thought that unscrupulous revengeful a might be must hardly venture to put to death moment expected to appear hour went slowly by have be gagged a soon a be bound effort have made have sufficed to get gag from mouth from time to time heard footstep a people went up down to floor above if must have freed mouth must have shouted in spite of knife with guard menaced at length light faded room presently became dark hour after night have fallen heard ring at bell one of guard answered four figure in monk clothes with hood over head entered brought stretcher laid down beside arthur lifted upon fastened strap across shoulder across leg then lifted stretcher bore away be greatly puzzled by proceeding might be men employed by count disguised a monk must hardly believe that be really monk be carried for long time a cloth have be thrown over must form idea whatever a to direction in bearer be proceeding when stopped knocked at door however calculated that journey have occupied at least three hour might therefore have come mile from city on other hand might have wound about so might not be hundred yard from place where be captured door opened after pause moved on again then arthur felt that be descending stair when reached bottom turned into door lowered stretcher to ground took off cloth rope bound arthur be loosed lantern be placed on floor without word whole party of monk left cell locked door behind arthur got up at once picked up lantern examined prison be cell ten foot square at one side be stone pallet on straw have be thrown otherwise floor be perfectly bare only window be opening near ceiling about foot long six inch wide with two strong bar across well said to certainly look like monk cell rather prison cell of monastery appears a if have not fallen into hand of count after thing be bad enough in conscience even to be in grip of inquisition doe not so far a know exist now must be better than to be in hand of such scoundrel still be strange that church must have interfered with know how bigoted clergy be how unscrupulous must not have thought that must have dared to meddle with british officer however can hardly believe that will attempt life see what good must do must give good deal to know what game be well suppose be useless to bother about at present be so stiff in wrist ankle can scarcely stand at rate be civil of to leave light in quarter of hour door opened again two monk came in put large jug of water dish of fried bean on floor retired without speaking let think arthur said to be friday so suppose be fast day hope be not sample of ordinary fare however a have have nothing since breakfast be not to be despised ate hearty meal then lay down on stone bench be soon asleep when awoke daylight be shining through little window got up looked round again certainly prospect be not cheering one wall be perfectly bare broken only by door window a cell be twelve foot high window be altogether beyond reach must have given good deal to be able to look out see whether be in town in country whether not window opened into courtyard question be however presently settled by sound of rumble of distant vehicle at long interval one passed window occasionally foot passenger went by arthur therefore concluded that be in town be equally certain that window looked into quiet little frequented street be probably level with pavement however gave little clue to position of monastery for there be knew at least dozen such building in town still be something to know that be within reach of human being illustration tall man with harsh ascetic face entered by standing against opposite wall must now obtain glimpse through window saw that wall of building must be at least two foot thick having made what observation must sat down on bed waited for what must come next presently breakfast be brought in consisted of bread fried meat to satisfaction coffee hour later door opened again tall man with harsh ascetic face entered perhaps wonder why be confined here said have come to tell be obstacle to design of church have seduced affection of one of daughter in order that may be saved from perdition must be doom if be to many heretic have be thought necessary to seclude here doubtless in time will recover from glamour that have thrown over will deeply regret passing aberration will again become obedient daughter of church perhaps find happy refuge in cloister when take place will be released not until then desire to be harsh with may be supplied with book other indulgence prisoner will remain until enters wall of cloister understand senor arthur said quietly perceive that be lady revenue not soul be main object of care well senor have made prisoner have sufficient faith in young lady affection to believe that until be absolutely convinced of death will not turn thought towards cloister that therefore be likely to have on hand for very considerable time at least be grateful to for offer of book will be glad if will furnish with selection may say further man said that will be instructed in tenet of religion must see error of way ask to be received into bosom of church possibly further objection to union with young lady in question may be removed arthur laughed opinion of principle must be very low one if can suppose that will be tempted to abandon even with bait a have be good enough to hold out naturally be opinion at present monk said coldly may alter after few month of confinement fancy not senor warn that more serious offence can be committed than capture imprisonment of officer in british service be prepared to take risk senor be not likely to be released happens until matter be arranged will now leave to yourself when door have opened arthur observed that number of monk be grouped in passage outside evidently prepared to fall upon must offer violence to prior attempt to make escape when prior have left arthur sat down thought matter over look out be certainly not bright saw that have very little chance of making escape from monastery be doubt large building with number of passage corridor in if must escape from cell must simply be lost so that long before must find way to gate must be overtaken captured again one thing however might do doubt for short time two monk who brought provision must be accompanied by others when found that showed sign of trying to effect escape must become le vigilant in case might possibly overcome two men make escape to story above drop out note from window might be taken to leon who must assuredly obtain release without delay must tear blank page out of one of book with be to be provided write message upon pencil have not be taken from pocket knife day went on have reason to complain of treatment food be good wholesome monk who attended to brought can of water daily carried away basin emptied swept out cell mattress blanket have be substituted for straw supply of such book a asked for have be brought to be evident that captor desired that must have nothing to complain of save loss of liberty after ten day resolved to carry plan into execution tearing out blank leaf carefully wrote upon be confined in monastery can give information a to position save that be in town apply to regent for order to search then signed name folded up slip of paper on outside wrote one hundred dollar will be paid by count leon de balen to anyone who will bring note to then waited for favourable opportunity have one day when meat be served to abstracted knife hidden in stocking monk when removed tray did not notice that anything be missing observed that on following day carefully felt mattress by guessed that loss of knife have not be discovered till morning monk fearing that must be blamed for carelessness have very likely protested that have brought a usual into kitchen with tray have only for own satisfaction looked to see if be hidden there arthur have taken without definite view of using thought that if attempt to obtain succour failed might come in useful in future plan might devise next day when attendant monk be bending to place basin tray on floor suddenly rushed at hurled to ground then hurried out of cell four monk be standing in passage running at full speed dashed at two of be levelled to ground cast other two aside ran on at end of passage be staircase up darted found in corridor similar to below number of door opened from turned handle of one of ran across room to window pushed hand through bar dropped note moment later heard bell ring loudly sharply doubtless one of men have overthrown have at once run to be giving alarm must send monk to entrance have done what have to do so walked quietly downstairs again five of monk be huddled in passage at approach took to headlong flight with laugh arthur entered cell sat down presently terrified face appeared at door looked in come in arthur said cheerfully trust did not hurt of merely wished to see whether muscle be in working order find that be quite right thank having ascertained have come back to cell can if like shut door again for room be rather draughty when be open door be immediately shut bolt shot arthur wondered what next move must be one came near for two hour then to surprise heard grinding sound against door minute later head of auger appeared hole be made touching first then fine saw be thrust through began to work presently piece be cut out of door six inch wide eighteen inch long after pause piece be fitted in again next heard sound of screw being driven in then saw that hinge have be fastened to flap so that must be opened closed from other side at will then heard two bolt fixed to noise went on for time knew by sound two more bolt have be screwed on to door saw at once that monk intended in future to pas food in to instead of entering cell proved to be case flap be opened tray handed in together with basin of water be determined that monk will not be exposed to assault battery again laughed have evidently given scare now have nothing to do wait see if anything come of note fortnight of anxious waiting passed food book water be handed in regularly one entered cell listened anxiously whenever heard slightest stir in monastery must tell that search be being made such sound met ear at last came to conclusion that note must never have reached leon hand being scrap of paper might have escaped eye of passer by be trodden in mud again prior might at once have suspected reason of strange conduct despatched monk to pick up note several time wrote same message on piece of paper rolled up into small ball threw through window in hope that passer by might be attracted by sight of pellet open to see what be in till end of fortnight remained patient spending most of time in reading when finally determined that letter have gone astray threw aside book decided that must rely upon be evident that if be to escape at must be through wall under window have read of escape by prisoner of have be performed in circumstance at least a difficult a confronted with mean better than knife have in possession much must of course depend upon thickness of wall material of be built must see by window that must be at least two foot thick if constructed of solid block of stone there must be possibility of getting out a knife be six inch long in blade so that must be necessary to wear wall away into dust of course if there be other way be what must attempt for precaution have be taken to prevent escape must not have be possible for monk when came in must not have failed to notice gradual crumbling away of wall there be however one other chance a be subterranean almost subterranean room there be not likely to be vault under therefore be probable that wall be not continued far under bottom of cell might be one foot might be two solid stonework must not go much deeper must rest upon bed of concrete possibly of loose rubble once through that must probably find nothing earth between pavement above pavement be in most of side street mere cobble stone therefore set to work now to examine stone forming floor be about two foot square after consideration determined that best to operate upon must be that at foot of bed a must be hidden from sight of anyone looking through trap greatest difficulty must be to get rid of material must necessarily be removed stone might manage to clear out by throwing through window with sufficient force to carry across street earth finally concluded must have to dispose of in same way in order to do however must have to reach window of course if be certain that cell must never be entered must pile up against wall to right left of door for hole be too narrow to admit head however be risk that must not like to run excavation must occupy many week possibly many month be hardly likely that so long time must elapse before visit be made to cell after much thinking concluded that if took up two of slab placed one against wall other upon must just reach window then by fastening end of blanket to one of bar must easily pull up by throw mould outside be certain to be slow work few handful of soil scattered on road must not be likely to attract attention examining floor carefully saw that slab of stone be by mean even from concluded that be not laid in cement probably not even in concrete that ground have be simply smoothed down flag laid on perhaps hammered down cell have probably not be intended a living room be used a prison perhaps a far back a day of inquisition having once made up mind carefully examined stone arthur lay down on floor prepared to act have just finished breakfast handed out tray a usual so must not be disturbed again for at least four hour began with knife to loosen stone at foot of bed be on left hand side of cell found to satisfaction that slab be laid close together not so closely that knife must not in most place go down between crevice be filled up with dust of many year took till dinner time to clear out be gratified at finding however while in place knife encountered stone when thrust deep at other point must push down to hilt without encountering obstacle showed that conjecture be correct ground have simply be smoothed down chip of stone from building thrown upon mixed with sand on paving have be laid down beyond fact that knife went lower than bottom of stone must not tell how thick floor be judged that must probably be three four inch be evident that must not get up by mere leverage of knife must only break tool if attempted have expected must be case after dinner interval began what knew must be one of most tedious part of undertaking be necessary that must scrape away part of stone in order to get finger under pocket knife be evidently better tool for than dinner knife have hitherto used slab so far a must make out be sandstone how hard must not tell began by dipping handkerchief into basin letting fall few drop at place upon intended to operate namely next bed started very carefully giving sort of rotatory motion to knife gradually water have dropped there became little turbid afforded encouragement worked steadily on till evening by time have succeeded in removing piece of stone eighth of inch deep after supper began again continued work far into night for be always furnished with lamp at last have increased hole to depth of fully quarter of inch width equal to of four finger well satisfied with result threw on pallet slept soundly until flap be opened breakfast tray thrust in a soon a have finished breakfast set to work again time using knife have be handed in with breakfast must not be demanded of until returned tray when received dinner be glad to make change for hand be blistered badly by previous day work smoothness of dinner knife be relief to besides saw that have already worn away point of pocket knife after fortnight steady work have satisfaction of feeling knife go through in two more day be able to get hand in now cleared out of earth at bottom then putting hand below stone exerted strength to utmost be delighted to find that yielded laid down executed dance of triumph must have astonished monk have looked in chapter xviii escaped be evening when arthur got up stone so put into place again after delight have little subsided rubbed dust into crevice then flung down for long night sleep next morning after breakfast set to work to remove dust round next stone when have done made hole under with finger even more easily than in case of first then replaced waited until dinner have be handed in having eaten took up two stone again laid one upright against wall under window placed other on top of then took running jump on to at same moment stretching arm a high up above head a must to delight found that be able to grasp one of bar got down took one of blanket again leaping up passed end round bar managed to grasp before fell backwards pulled blanket half way round bar caught hold of part when next sprang up be able without difficulty to raise until face be level with window look out be better than have expected in front of be street on other side be piece of waste ground nothing must have be handier for purpose a stone earth thrown on to must certainly attract notice having taken good look lowered to floor relaid second stone have raised put other alongside so that must replace in instant if must hear footstep coming down passage then took mattress bedding off bench for resolved to spread upon bed earth rubble got out during day a must be dangerous to throw out until dark after set to work with dinner knife be not long before have loosened earth rubble inch deep removed by night have excavated hole two foot deep spreading rubbish carefully a got out on bed have not made hole quite so wide a stone in order that might have support when be replaced then hung up one blanket a before placed considerable quantity of earth in other blanket hauled up to window so a to save labour of climbing up afresh with handful listening attentively so a to be sure that one be coming along flung with force through window when have disposed of have brought up filled blanket again so continued until have thrown out whole on following day not only got out earth to greater depth be able to push trench under adjoining slab be in contact with wall got rid of earth stone a before next morning worked with renewed vigour for result of day labour must be to show whether stone work be carried down below level of floor whether wall rested upon concrete third slab came up without difficulty digging down by wall to great satisfaction found that rested on foundation of coarse concrete must doubt be troublesome by mean impervious soon cleared out earth rubble to same level a other part of trench after spreading a usual under mattress began important task of picking out concrete have not be at work long before found that in order to get room to use arm must widen out at end against wall caused whole day delay cutting of concrete be toilsome took week of almost incessant labour to make passage sufficiently large for to crawl through having ascertained that a have expected ground beyond be composed of mixed soil a within wall have be with fragment of stone gave day rest before proceeding further be now six week since imprisonment began felt sure that must require only three four day more work to get to surface outside wondered what friend have be doing worried greatly about anxiety mercedes must have experienced thought indeed have frequently kept to work when must otherwise have desisted from fatigue felt in working in cramped position be necessary while getting through concrete roper too must be in terrible way leon must be moving heaven earth to find clue to fate wondered what have be doing in what direction have be searching for must have disappeared a suddenly a if earth have opened swallowed without leaving single clue one thing be certain suspicion must fall upon don silvio leon must probably lay case before queen regent don silvio might not impossibly be arrested on charge of being concerned in disappearance must not help believing that man be at bottom of for think how must no other reason for seizure presented ostensibly have be imprisoned in order that connection with mercedes might be broken off in case might enter convent to great advantage of revenue knowledge that there be engagement between be at present confined to leon sister for have be agreed that must be much better to keep quiet until time approached for marriage a leon felt that church must use effort to prevent from taking place mercedes might indeed have spoken of in confession be far more likely that count silvio whose jealousy have be clearly aroused who hated for result of duel have set church authority to work be not probable that prior of monastery have acted on own responsibility be not monastery must benefit by mercedes fortune mere zeal must scarcely have prompted prior to take so strong step a to have carried off doubtless therefore be acting under superior authority although inquisition have died out heretic must no longer be tortured brought to stake roman church in spain be still almost a bigoted a in olden day must assuredly not hesitate to take step to prevent what must be considered a backsliding of one of faith knowing enormous influence priest still exercised measure have be taken with reference to scarcely seemed extraordinary to arthur resented rather because believed that don silvio be at bottom of than on account of outrage against after rest of thirty six hour arthur set to work a soon a have eaten supper lamp contained enough oil to burn night be only by light that be able to work lying on stomach in hole gradually drove tunnel forward being obliged frequently to come out with earth rubble a dug down when have got two foot beyond wall turned on back placing lamp on chest began to bring down earth above luckily mould be firm tightly packed for while there be thus fear of sudden fall wall stood upright earth dug out like putty have not trouble of taking out a fell merely pushed back into open trench by morning must stand upright to work a bottom of hole be two foot below floor be now four foot above labour have be very great although have worked stripped to waist have suffered much from heat rubbed with blanket a have done ever since began work for have washed appearance of water must at once have aroused suspicion that be engaged upon work of kind dressed again be ready to receive breakfast after eating went soundly to sleep must scarce rouse sufficiently to get up take in dinner when came putting tray down at once went off to sleep again at five o'clock woke ate dinner when supper arrived put that by till midnight now set to work with renewed vigour for if went well must be free by morning put two of paving stone against side of shaft standing upon be able to bring down earth rapidly when have dug two foot higher trod earth have fallen firmly down placing stone on again mounted on by twelve o'clock must no longer reach overhead measuring from level of floor of cell found that cavity be now seven foot above now pulled out paving stone set to work to dig hole on side of shaft in must place foot having gained foot by mean went out ate supper dressed be certain now that must be out before daybreak again set to work earth came down fast under stroke of knife at last at about four o'clock in morning blade struck against stone felt be round differed altogether from have met with embedded in earth gradually cleared space beneath then found that layer of stone closely packed together formed ceiling of shaft worked with renewed energy until whole of earth beneath be cleared away then dug two more foot hole two foot higher than have last rested on taking place in pushed with force with hand stone gave way at once hand be in air in minute rest be cleared off putting hand on edge of hole hauled up be free man in joy of heart set off to run presently steadied down into walk be quarter of hour before came upon church familiar to be then able to direct course to lodging have key of outer door opening felt way up stair until reached door key gave admittance here opening door of sitting room felt way to mantel here be always placed flint steel bundle of slip of rag dipped in sulphur for although phosphorus match be rapidly making way in england be a yet unknown in madrid at first blow of flint against steel heard movement in next room a spark flew on to tinder by stroke heard roper exclaim who be that a jumped out of bed be roper there be perfect shout of joy then heard honest fellow burst into fit of hysterical sobbing moment later sulphur ignited tinder lighted candle door of roper bedroom be open arthur saw that have sunk back on to bed again with hand before face went in to put hand upon shoulder roper old friend said compose thank god be back again safe sound lord be praised roper said a brushing tear aside stood up grasped arthur hand be almost a if have come back from dead sir have kept on saying must return though knew in ray heart have lost hope why said a went back to light be a black a coal have happened to be only honest dirt roper will go have thorough wash then will tell about went into own room opened on other side of sitting room by time came back roper have lighted three more candle have partly dressed have got out bottle of wine glass get out glass roper light fire then will sit down talk over by way if have anything to eat may a well put on table be five hour since have have supper have be doing hard work since roper hurried away to get thing together while arthur changed clothes entirely two three shirt have be handed in week to while be confined in prison be glad enough of complete change now roper said a sat down will eat talk in first place tell about friend count have be looking for everywhere sir have have whole police in search of have got don silvio under arrest can not find out that be concerned in disappearance though nobody have doubt about miss mercedes have be ill be be told in bed for month be up now a servant tell looking like ghost however have doubt will soon get round now that be back difficulty have be to know where to start looking for one have seen since left house one morning two month ago shortly after breakfast from time have disappeared a if earth have swallowed up always said 'the captain will come back if be alive bolt bar wo hold really believed so for three four week when time went on there be sign of began to think that must have gone under if have knew must have be directly be taken for before two day have passed don silvio have be caught be down at place in country be able to prove that be there at date of capture well kept under arrest thinking that if did come back must be able to prove that have hand in somehow believe have roper though may say have shadow of proof now will tell about went into full history of capture of imprisonment of interview with prior of manner in have made escape have done well indeed sir to get out of place a did if have be there must never have come out again alive lord how must have worked so priest be at bottom of after not quite at bottom for have doubt that don silvio put up to doubt said to 'here be young lady of noble family with fine income want to throw away on protestant foreigner if can manage to keep away from be pretty sure to go into convent said when threw over year half ago that be intention not to marry to lead religious life therefore if get lover removed now doubt will do so see there be two motif for getting shut up one to avoid grievous scandal of catholic lady of good family marrying heretic second that of getting possession of dowry well thank goodness have baulked have colonel wylde be here sir have be up in north ever since disappeared have there be much fighting there none at maroto turned traitor sold don carlos surrendered on condition of big grant of money army dispersed don carlos have crossed frontier espartero have be made duke of vittoria be still in north settling thing in east there have be fighting only small affair so have not lost anything way be seven o'clock in morning before arthur have brought story to close now said have better go at once across to count leon dare say will be up by time take aside quietly tell that be here that leave to to break news to sister a think best when have done so will of course go round see roper returned in hour with count dear arthur dear arthur latter exclaimed a ran into room embraced friend thank god that be back again have given up hope have question at in mind that have be murdered quietly by order of don silvio be buried in obscure spot where body must never be found must not at first believe what man told hour ago fancy took by shoulder shook told be mad liar at last be convinced that be sane hurried off together came too fast for talk gathered from that have be confined in monastery yes leon except be kept solitary prisoner in cell have nothing much to complain of be frankly told by prior must remain there however long time might be until mercedes have taken veil rascal leon said wrathfully be just what feared at least something like when agreed that engagement to have better be kept private for time not of course that ever dreamt that must attempt to carry off knew that must move heaven earth to break off match now please tell about arthur again went through story gave reason for believing don silvio be at bottom of regard that a certain leon said that doe not alter fact will have to take care of mercedes may try to suppress a have tried to suppress have seen queen christina several time be intensely interested in case must go see afternoon lay fact before will ask to take mercedes under protection be sure will do even church must not venture to drag from palace a to affair will require good deal of talking over of course if report what have happened to government will kick up tremendous row about know that must be of advantage either to to can quite understand that leon be last thing must wish to do a say will require lot of thinking about talking over at first blush certainly seems to that now have got away without further damage injury than being shut up for couple of month best policy be to say nothing about of course will have to consider whether there will be repetition of still more whether sister be likely to suffer persecution to incur risk of being kidnapped of course have not told yet have turned up again doe not get up till ten o clock thought a well not to disturb besides really knew nothing about beyond fact that have reappeared even of felt scarcely assured until saw for have not entertained shadow of hope that be alive will go break news to now may come across in hour very well will not expect to see perhaps have better not see at to day may be well to break to very gradually if be to tell that morning have obtained clue thought possible have be carried away shut up in monastery then afternoon must further say that believed knew monastery be in be imprisoned that intended at once to take step to obtain release then either evening to morrow morning must tell truth take in to believe must be best plan arthur have be very ill be at present mere ghost of herself be of cheerful disposition although have come to despair of ever seeing again be sure that must eagerly grasp at shadow of hope once have again will soon pick up in case have better not come round to house leon think not if of servant be to see might in spite of order might issue make hash of in way other doubt whether must be able to help doing so by look if not by tongue for be general favourite in house although one have ever be told must think that many must have idea how matter stand between mercedes a colonel wylde be away there can be reason for leaving house be better that must not do so because must be sure to meet somebody who must know a disappearance have be talk of town must carry news home to family of lady might take across to mercedes will be back again in hour will come round in carriage then will drive together to palace to prevent possibility of someone spreading news from there will give strict order whoever call to day matter who be be not to be allowed to see sister of course will not tell either of girl look must let secret out before have be with for two minute leon be back in course of hour have administered first dose of hope said effect have be wonderful before be sitting absolutely listless taking interest whatever in anything went on around now be flushed excited began by saying that information have reached that led to believe that have be carried to monastery did very gently in roundabout way leapt to foot with eye blazing insisted on knowing be ground of belief be obliged to tell knew for almost certainty on evening of day on disappeared monk be noticed carrying litter through street said that of course might mean nothing that be certainly singular have already set number of men to work to find out where monk have be last seen direction in be proceeding that hoped by afternoon to get certain news promised must let know directly did so argued that four monk must hardly be carrying dead man must see reason why must be carrying living one said that cloth have be thrown over litter that one must see who what be beneath left walking up down room in state of great agitation rather think must be better to change plan let know whole truth shortly perhaps so leon will sit here for half hour then can go in break news to little by little till at last can tell be in house waiting to see must advise a go along to call at doctor take with in case shock be too much for perhaps must be advisable leon said anxiety excitement might be worse for her than sudden joy must be accordingly drove back to leon count went into sister room while arthur went into drawing room where two younger girl be sitting leapt up with scream a entered looked at a if doubting evidence of sens held up hand be said make noise brother have gone in to break news to mercedes convinced that eye have not deceived girl ran forward embraced affectionately pouring out question a to where have be how be that have returned be long story said can not tell now have be shut up to prevent from marrying mercedes have managed to make way out again a can see by looking at hand held out have done lot of hard work in breaking out girl uttered exclamation at blistered state of hand be nothing to what be after first four five day work said really be bad then have got pretty horny now who must have wanted to interfere between mercedes one have right to interfere with except leon there be people who think have right to interfere said do interfere in most matter in country look very white arthur elder girl said yes dare say have be two month in cell with very little light in cell repeated yes there be great hardship in have book to read very decent food so only thing have to complain of be loss of liberty chatted for few minute longer then door opened leon appeared beckoned to arthur to follow know that be in madrid free that will be here in few minute have better leave to herself for little while to get calm of course be greatly shaken stood better than have expected when went in found that believed have not told be prepared to find have really got important clue a to whereabouts of course that made easier for to tell truth gradually talked for short time then leon went out of room minute later mercedes ran in with cry of joy rushed into arthur arm leon came in ten minute later found sitting on sofa with head on arthur shoulder be almost worth while having be so unhappy leon said to feel such joy a do now well wo say that mercedes at same time admit that be very joyful to have back again know nothing yet said of what have happened what have kept away from have be too perfectly happy at having back to think of asking what have be doing have be shut up to keep away from to keep away from mercedes repeated yes dear seems that occurred to of worthy father of church that must be very sinful thing for to marry heretic also that if heretic be to disappear possibly might take into head to enter convent bestow wealth upon church accordingly seized put into cell in monastery informed that must have to remain there until have entered convent a arthur entertained quite different view set to work to escape from cell after six week hard digging underground morning made way out here be be possible girl said standing up with wide open eye that be church took arthur from yes dear unworthy member of church arthur said when be married take to england will teach what church belief will never remain in church have treated so will talk about dear later on arthur said soothingly there be bad people good in church there be reason for changing because of may do wrong thing if day really come to think that religion be best will be very pleased must not be because men in excess of zeal for church have somewhat ill treated leon nodded approvingly speak rightly arthur many evil thing have be done in spain by priest believe that misfortune have befallen be punishment for evil deed done in name of religion here a say be not because evil deed be mistakenly done in name that religion be bad be bigot there be very few educated men in country who be so fully recognized when first saw what mercedes feeling be towards that if became wife be possible that in time must adopt religion in main feature there be great difference between two creed certainly must feel great grief must mercedes adopt faith agree with that must be a result of conviction not merely because have reason to complain of action towards of certain fanatic now will go in to girl who will be dying to know what have taken place chapter xix military movement now girl leon said when arthur have given full relation of adventure must understand that story must not go beyond whether step will be taken in matter must depend largely upon what queen regent adviser decide be grave matter for state to embroil with church arthur have already told that will be guided entirely by wish in matter thank for consideration angry a be at what have taken place feel that ourselves must not suffer be grave scandal to get abroad for might be result to people who have be concerned in must undoubtedly be held in respect accountable for be certainly serious matter to quarrel with church result might be very far reaching if outrage upon british officer be known in england must produce most unfavourable impression cause of queen have received warm support there british soldier sailor have be fighting for there be still strong carlist party in england must certainly take advantage of affair to stir up public feeling against therefore feel that be under great obligation to arthur for volunteering to put in hand of regent to consent to allow business to be hushed up at rate must preserve absolute silence until know what be to be done be going to drive to palace now to lay matter before regent will be able to tell more afternoon now mercedes if will take advice will lie down for bit have be ill know be not yet strong will soon be strong again said still will take advice for do feel shaken want to be bright afternoon when come back leon drove with arthur to palace former sent in word to queen regent that begged to see in private audience quarter of hour later be shown into room where be sitting rose with exclamation of surprise on seeing arthur why where have be captain hallett exclaimed began to give up hope of ever seeing again be somewhat long story majesty if will condescend to listen to will tell to in full have come not to demand justice at hand to leave matter entirely to to take step step at a may decide then told story narrative being frequently interrupted by exclamation of anger from christina be infamous exclaimed when brought story to end most infamous thank most heartily for having come direct to instead of sending complaint home be very serious matter church be already by mean well disposed towards priest throughout country have largely thrown influence on to side of enemy have council afternoon will bring matter before have indeed added greatly to obligation be already under to by offering to leave matter in hand of course have right to large compensation for illegal imprisonment can assure that desire compensation at majesty have already benefited very largely by bounty only thing must ask be that if nothing be done will receive donna mercedes at palace take under protection until be married having failed with next attempt will be made upon must find much harder task than have to free from hand will very gladly do senor think that even church must venture to interfere with lady under protection if did must find far le forgiving than be next morning arthur received message requesting to go to palace case be fully discussed yesterday captain queen regent said council be grateful for magnanimity in placing in hand be fully sensible of great wrong have be inflicted upon of very serious consequence might have ensued if have chosen to place case in hand of british government have sent to prior of monastery of st isidore be called before council ordered to explain conduct did not in way attempt to deny fact a stated by declared that be acting under order of bishop whereupon order be sent latter to leave country at once take up residence at rome until will have received permission to return council proposed to pay ten thousand pound a indemnity for treatment have received told must inform of decision that have already expressed to determination not to accept one be little incredulous said with slight smile be not to be wondered at considering that there be not one of who must in similar circumstance have felt slightest hesitation in accepting such offer however told must see to day lay offer before need hardly say majesty decline own be well pleased to hear that author of affair have received punishment after madam think will be necessary for donna mercedes to avail herself of kind protection issue of order for bishop to go into exile will be so strong mark of majesty displeasure that there can think be fear whatever of further step being taken by enemy donna mercedes have be very ill think will be more likely to recover health speedily in society of brother sister than in atmosphere of palace where however great majesty kindness there must be certain amount of stiffness ceremony must have be glad to have with christina said there be doubt certain amount of truth in what say however will have here frequently so that may be understood that be special friend of mine in case be sure one will try to interfere with colonel wylde returned that evening after hearing whole story from arthur expressed warm approval of course have taken must have be most damaging to royal cause said if affair have be made public in england though think must have be more than justified in accepting amount offered a indemnity can admire disinterestedness in refusing now colonel be ready to start for point where may require service have be idle too long already well war be practically over in north scoundrel maroto have arranged term for for few of friend with espartero have made condition for soldier who have fought so hard for don carlos however have be permitted to return to home at present espartero be occupied in settling affair there in preparing army to take field in spring against cabrera number of small isolated campaign be going on in aragon have already three four commissioner there be perhaps a well that must proceed there at once a be now three month since have have report from to send in with mine have of course be obliged to report disappearance will now mention that have be pounced upon by enemy of queen held in confinement that have effected escape that evening arthur heard from leon count silvio have be released from close observation have be subjected to for past two month be believed said that be instigator of action against there be proof that be so there be therefore excuse for keeping further under arrest have however be ordered to retire to estate a there be at least strongest ground for suspecting that be concerned in attack upon by street ruffian whole conduct have be in highest degree suspicious will be glad to know that be away leon of course be not sure that be really concerned in imprisonment priest who be mercedes confessor be likely enough to be at bottom of think so too have told mercedes that have better choose other confessor think two men be set upon by be inclined to own be in wrong in matter of duel be somewhat reasonable that must have be jealous must have be fair if have contented with running through shoulder instead of making perfect laughing stock be irritated by manner by way in have brought two three dozen of friend to see run through still own be wrong if man must come offer to shake hand must not refuse to do so then be good deal more forgiving than must be leon said heartily must like nothing better than to fight however admit that there be something in what say certainly have ground of complaint against mercedes felt that be hard upon when wrote begging to break off engagement of course have be glad did so since have come to know better feel mercedes have very fortunate escape let go out unless be accompanied by one of sister a well a duenna will take care of will be well looked after promise suppose will care for going out except to palace will be well for to go there pretty often be fond of christina will feel that intimacy there will be great protection to in catalonia carlists be still very strong royal army numbered at least fifty five thousand men about seventeen thousand half of whom be regular troop garrisoned permanent fort of remainder twenty five thousand belonging to local militia be scattered among fewer than two hundred seventeen fortified village small town be of military importance if have not be defended cabrera force be marching about country must have swept bare of inhabitant carrying off store contained burning to ground be therefore necessary to garrison not only because diminished supply of store available for use of enemy because enabled contribution to be levied for queen cause undoubtedly holding of place answered purpose upon other hand employment in manner of practically whole army in catalonia completely unfitted for operation in field enabled cabrera to carry on operation without meeting with efficient opposition in way captured place after place massacring greater portion of inhabitant striking terror into others arthur have be despatched to join command of general van halen who be occupied principally in endeavouring to victual lucena in trying in feeble way to fortify castle of onda operation progressed slowly for although war have be going on for year tool be available be necessary to send to cadiz to purchase colonel lacy alderson be with van halen when arthur arrived after staying here for short time joined command of general ayerbe who be endeavouring to mitigate carlist system of atrocity on subject arthur exchanged several letter with cabrera general ayerbe be also endeavouring to prevent carlists from carrying out fortification of segura important place in aragon a lay on line of march to teruel alcaniz parra be lying near refused to co operate with ayerbe van halen determined to march on segura lay siege to before arrived however ayerbe having be reinforced defeated carlists at place two hour march from town drove back from new work in report of action mentioned that captain hallett have rendered material service have led small party of cavalry in brilliant charge decided fate of day serrano brought up battering train from saragossa consisted however of only three pounder inch mortar inch howitzer ammunition must obtain amounted to fifteen hundred shot one thousand shell be long business to bring up even feeble train weather be inclement in extreme when arrived in front of segura garrison of have be very strongly reinforced by cabrera found that force be wholly insufficient for attack upon place that town have be burnt by carlists to prevent from affording shelter to besieger surrounding country have be wasted for many mile large body of carlists be seen upon adjoining height therefore consulted with officer commanding various army unanimously declared that must be madness to attempt siege in such circumstance abandoning idea therefore embarked upon series of long fatiguing march by caused carlists to give up siege of several place did not however mitigate animosity of rival who succeeded in obtaining recall on ground of having abandoned siege of segura said might easily have fallen into hand nogueras succeeded be speedily displaced by ayerbe however did not long retain command be given to o'donnell active energetic young officer owing to absence of decisive action arthur remained at head quarter receiving order from colonel lacy who be principal of four english commissioner attached to army of catalonia aragon hailed appointment of o'donnell a affording ground for hope that at last something like vigour must be shown in operation of army be at present scattered about country employed rather in collecting provision for own subsistence than in harassing enemy if be that fighting in north be finished that few more month will see end of whole affair must throw up commission go home arthur said one day to roper really be sickening having gone through so much of must not like to leave until be over sir must like to see carlists smashed up altogether before go still be dull work of course while be staying down here in saragossa get plenty to eat drink when be away in country be pretty rough work beggar must turn up nose at food have to eat must not mind if there be really anything to do spaniard be so pig headed that wo take advice have big army if must gather together go at carlists yes certainly seems like roper must remember that big army requires tremendous transport train for must have to carry everything with at time of year little food be to be obtained in fact people of village little town scarcely do cultivation of land for can not tell who will reap what have sown then too most of country be mountainous road be everywhere abominable even if have train sufficient to carry supply must be so large cumbrous that tail must not have left halting place when head arrived at destination must remember that if concentrate carlists must do same portion of must harass along whole line of march while must make excursion wherever pleased for march light must go three mile to one that can cover there be doubt that dispersal of force over so large extent of country among so many town village be grievous mistake be very difficult to see what else can be done for if gave defence place must lie at mercy of carlists must be obliged in self preservation to go over to thus enormously increasing recruiting ground enabling to get store wherever marched if cabrera must gather whole of force together allow to do same risk everything on pitched battle matter must soon be brought to end a be be afraid will have to wait till espartero arrives before business can be wound up illustration two weapon flashed at same moment first step general o'donnell have to undertake be relief of general asnar who be shut up by carlists in lucena having received large reinforcement started for place marching unencumbered by baggage enemy first position near lucena be easily carried five battalion then attacked enemy left occupied position must enable to take christino advance in flank when movement be successful two battalion attacked right of carlist position while o'donnell placed at head of rest of troop who advanced with loud cheer to charge over very rugged ground under very heavy fire carlists must not wait to stand bayonet charge abandoned ground leaving road open to lucena where asnar with troop have be imprisoned for twenty two day be brilliant piece of fighting immensely raised spirit of royal troop who found that be at last commanded by man not by incapable almost imbecile dummy on following day o'donnell marched to murviedro though have not have more than three hour continuous rest since have left saragossa fortnight later proceeded to take possession of height beyond arteza intention being to besiege tale be important because commanded water supply of town of onda position of enemy be strong one right be on hill called pena negro on round hill on slope between tale centre be upon castle of tale left on precipitous height from last mentioned carlists be driven without loss after offering very slight resistance arthur have be requested by colonel alderson engineer officer who be now senior commissioner to reconnoitre ground beyond height to ascertain whether place must be better bombarded from rear roper a usual rode with have gone distance when saw two horseman approaching at full gallop a be apparently unaccompanied arthur paid little attention to rode on until heard loud imperious order to stop reining in horse awaited arrival of two unknown men be within fifty yard when arthur exclaimed be cabrera well be not sorry to meet cabrera a approached gave shout of satisfaction a recognized arthur well exclaimed have got better of twice time will be turn be a may be arthur replied saw cabrera draw pistol from holster did same two weapon flashed out together arthur felt stinging pain a if red hot iron have crossed cheek cabrera dropped pistol having evidently received shot in right arm drew sword with left rode at arthur combatant fought with fury cabrera animated by burning desire for vengeance arthur by thought of importance of killing cabrera for be spirit of war after death carlist movement must soon come to end combat be short desperate disadvantage of having to use left arm greatly hampered cabrera in point of skill must have be in case inferior to opponent for time fury of assault counterbalanced parrying three four furious cut arthur delivered heavy blow on antagonist left shoulder inflicting severe wound striking from saddle cabrera leapt to foot again arthur dismounted demanded surrender never carlist said cabrera will never be taken alive roper have by time disembarrassed of antagonist by running through body now rode up cabrera be half mad with rage arm be useless just a arthur be about to throw upon overpower roper shouted mount master mount ride fifty of fellow be upon looking round arthur saw that body of men be riding furiously towards be little over fifty yard away hesitated moment then leapt on to horse shouting to cabrera next time senor will finish what have begun then rode off several shot be fired leaning low in saddle galloped away at full speed being well mounted be speedily beyond pursuit indeed most of carlists have gathered round chief on regaining camp arthur reported what have taken place to colonel alderson who at once took across to o'donnell have done well indeed captain hallett said general though be grievous pity that did not kill must have be more to advantage than winning of pitched battle will lay up for time will be more to than reinforcement of ten thousand men thank most heartily sir in name of government cabrera indeed after wound be attended to still gave order for defence of town inspired troop by presence under eye made several desperate sortie against battery be being prepared for breaching wall battery be placed feebly worked for throughout war christino operation in way of siege be always unskilfully managed owing to utter incompetence of engineer however week after appearance before town fire be opened siege be delayed for time owing to necessity for sending reinforcement to body of queen troop have suffered severe defeat at chulilla battering train be small indifferent several of gun gave way during bombardment lasted seven day at end of time assault be ordered engineer obstinately refused to accept colonel alderson advice to make ladder although be evident that breach must not be scaled without resisting very strongly enemy left be at last turned round tower on right captured garrison however fought desperately made continuous effort to retake day battle continued breach in castle be found to be impracticable be at last enlarged enemy be compelled to surrender day fighting however have cost queen troop loss of at least four hundred killed wounded almost of might have be spared have colonel alderson advice be taken cabrera have left town before attack began being too much injured to take command defence however have be gallant one although capture of place gave great encouragement to christinos stubbornness of defence loss have inflicted served to show carlists that conquest of number of strongly fortified position held be beyond opponent power o'donnell destroyed castle tower then retired a town must no longer be held by carlists for purpose of harassing garrison of onda decided now to reduce number of carlists fortified place wait for arrival of espartero carlists took offensive column moved about with such activity that army be kept constantly on march to encounter drive back again into mountain be not till october that espartero arrived at saragossa met o'donnell there then be decided that until arrival of reinforcement be coming from north o'donnell must continue in command force being strengthened by seven battalion of army of north espartero advanced with rest of own force plan however be altered by early setting in of winter road speedily became impassable provision be terribly scarce movement of army paralysed energy of commander be indeed required to maintain supply of provision for troop english commissioner for most part returned to madrid among be arthur who spent four month there very happily nothing have be heard of don silvio who be still living on estate be evident to that war must speedily come to close body of troop from part of spain be moving to scene of action when season opened espartero must be at head of army against even cabrera must not hope to make head that indefatigable fighter be lying ill at morella result of wound although not serious in have be rendered so by incessant energy activity with have persisted in moving about news of retirement of don carlos have for long time be kept from peasantry even when became known have little effect upon cared little for don carlos almost worshipped cabrera be ready to follow to death when spring came operation must be resumed flocked to standard again in a large number a before in february campaign reopened arthur started to rejoin army at one of town at stopped roper came in hour after arrival said captain do know feel pretty sure have seen don silvio be only back be true be convinced that be be walking along when saw man who be coming other way suddenly turn off down aide street when got to end of looked down for saw by sudden turn have taken that wished to avoid by distance have gone seemed to that must have be running be too far away from to speak of identity with certainty thought still think that be don silvio what must be doing here roper can not say sir at rate seems to that presence here just at moment when be coming through look like mischief well of course anyone at madrid watching might have found out day on be going to start might have sent message to don silvio in time to enable to ride here before came along may of course have brought three four men with be more likely to have done than to have trusted to recruiting fellow here be just a well if be man that must have recognized roper for at rate will not be taken by surprise perhaps sir must be a well to stop few day here to change route there be two three road by might get to saragossa must certainly be farther than direct one must make little difference whether arrived there two three day earlier later be true enough roper if be watching here must follow by one road a well a have pistol sword must say that must render pretty good account of four five of have doubt must captain still must rather not fight against long odds if must avoid see sir since got that fifteen hundred pound banked to credit in england feel more careful about life than before did not much matter then whether went down not now seems to that life have distinct value want to throw away well can say same roper of course always knew be coming into estate day know that thought much about now life be of great value because be of value to donna mercedes say anything about money have acquired certainly for sake do hold to life pretty strongly at same time can not turn back from duty for unknown danger merely because think have recognized don silvio have proved that be far better swordsman than since duel with have practised good deal with pistol can think account with for two three assailant have practised a well fancy that ought to be able to settle with two of in four shot let suppose that don silvio have six fellow with must hardly say that must bring more well if can dispose of two that only leaf with three counting don silvio to manage well captain be right if six men be lying in ambush fire together may upset calculation altogether be certainly so roper unless be going to turn tail ride back to madrid on strength of belief that saw don silvio see how be to be helped mind be not whom don silvio want to kill have got shirt of mail think that pistol bullet must go through so that if direct fire at unless be shot through head reckon that will still be in fighting order after first discharge at rate roper mean to turn back well if go on of course go on sir roper said doggedly there be question at about think roper best thing for to do must be when have taken meal to sally out in different direction with cloak on cap over face possibly one other of may alight upon if be here if meet will talk matter over again want to do anything headstrong if ascertain that count be here will discus whether can make detour will throw off scent though say honestly think attempt must be of use if have men with will certainly be posted on watch round hotel will learn that there be to be learned of movement do will have to fight for if have more than six men must say that if be attacked have better trust to horse not to strength of arm ride for there be nothing cowardly in running away from greatly superior force certainly will not hesitate to do so if see that be too strong for accordingly after dinner put on cloak sallied out move out of main street of town roper arthur said will not attack there if be to turn down side street might fall upon suddenly have better be back here in hour time will then exchange note at end of time met again at door of inn think be right roper be sure that one man at least have followed time have be out thought so at first captain fellow suspected brushed against roughly before have be out very long then apologized struck that wanted to look at face anyhow did not see anything of afterwards don silvio must not have given very accurate description of for a stand six foot one be not more than five foot eight one who knew anything about must very well mistake have certainly be followed said arthur feel sure that if have moved out of main street must have be attacked there be two fellow who kept together who followed close behind suspected three a generally kept at about same distance from well have doubt now that be right about don silvio will see if have got thing a map in hotel suppose have at rate will ask landlord to send up man who know road well to room will find out a much a can of different route then can decide on what have best do chapter xx end of feud result of arthur enquiry be that three road by must travel to saragossa be about equally bad that upon of there be place along face of hill at attack might be made have mind said to roper afterwards to hire couple of men a guide telling that have better bring weapon with be likely enough that one two of don silvio men may be stationed in hotel may be sure must question anyone who have be up to room don silvio might afterwards see hire service might be shot in back when others opened fire at from ambush so think can not do better than go forward by main road if once get start of may not be able to catch for be certainly not likely to be better mounted than be can not go on before for then must not know road must take accordingly in morning a soon a have mounted took straight road travelled fast kept keen look out at spot where ambush be likely to be planted everything be quiet reached destination that evening without adventure will be more dangerous to morrow roper arthur said a sat at supper together be fairly started on road now there be choice open to a to route can take will know may start before do choose position for attacking well almost hope will do so sir be not afraid of fight make one jumpy keeping always on look out expecting shot from bush pas feel that roper if must fight must rather do so now have done with next morning feeling that if enemy have started in front of must be useless to try to evade proceeded at much slower pace than on previous day after riding three hour came to spot where road be cut along face of almost perpendicular hill with torrent running at foot a began to ascend arthur unbuckled cover of holster so that pistol be ready for instant use directed roper to do same now said will ride on left keeping exactly alongside be whom will fire at a mail shirt of mine will keep out ordinary pistol ball be not afraid that will be hurt directly have fired will be sure to jump out from place where may be lying then empty pistol among go at there be place for to hide here there maybe farther on at rate do a tell keep horse head in line with mine holding rein in left hand keeping right close on handle of pistol arthur rode on roper have attempted to remonstrate against order have given arthur silenced must just do a be ordered roper one two might shoot at if be riding behind then must be left alone to fight whole of will certainly want help rode along until came to spot where cliff fell away leaving semicircular depression be filled with low bush be here if anywhere said arthur get pistol ready roper a rode along past place number of men sprang up fired volley arthur felt sudden acute pain in rib be nearly knocked from horse recovering with great effort fired twice two of men dropped moment later horse staggered fell a did so dragged other pistol out shot man who be rushing at with clubbed musket heard roper pistol go off be too much engaged with fourth man who rushed at to see what be result have just run antagonist through when don silvio leapt upon arthur parried thrust aimed at at once engaged in furious combat don silvio leapt round with agility of cat springing in out delivering fierce lunge a did so otherwise there be silence be vaguely conscious that roper be down that have disposed of last of antagonist that issue remained solely between count be at disadvantage with latter for while be armed only with regulation cutting sword antagonist have long straight duelling rapier for time contented with standing on guard be several time narrowly touched at last seizing opportunity struck at opponent rapier with force blade shivered in count hand before must raise guard again latter sprung upon like wild cat grasped by throat trying to hurl over precipice arthur dropped sword be useless to now grasping antagonist wrist tried to drag from throat rage have given don silvio strength while arthur be almost choking under pressure at last with mighty effort succeeded in turn gained grip on throat of antagonist dragged to edge of precipice holding one hand on throat with other grasping by middle raised from ground to hurl over instant don silvio career must have come to end almost in act of throwing arthur paused sight of count convulsed face eye moved from purpose set down again on road releasing a did so don silvio said sternly have at mercy thought came into mind that caused to change purpose feel a have along felt have not be altogether blameless in matter be natural that must have be exasperated by belief have gained affection of donna mercedes that must thereupon have forced duel upon feel be wrong in way in fought might have contented with merely wounding whereas played with first made laughing stock of friend have brought to witness triumph considering that be spaniard have idea of revenge can pardon attempt of two men whom doubt not bribed to stab know what share have in getting into prison do care to enquire have now again worsted have at mercy looking back seeing have be to extent wrong give life go home senor retrieve past believe that be honourable gentleman before be led astray by anger at being superseded in affection of donna mercedes that quarrel have be fought out come to end go home try to forget what have passed will never hear of from don silvio staggered back stared in bewildered incredulity at arthur who turning away at once went to roper side latter be insensible evidently from effect of tremendous blow from butt end of musket delivered by man who lay dead beside roper have indeed fired inflicted mortal wound upon adversary who be in act of striking blow have fallen be last effort of striker two have fallen side by side arthur went to dead horse pulled out flask from wallet poured brandy water between roper lip rubbed on forehead soon have satisfaction of seeing follower open eye be all right roper said have thrashed have have nasty knock on head fortunately crown be pretty thick will be all right again in few minute then a saw that roper be rallying turned to count who be sitting on fallen rock with head in hand seven dead body lay in road count got up a approached englishman said in low voice have indeed proved conqueror in way in fighting in generosity can scarcely even now believe that be alive that have spared when be wholly at mercy deserve life at hand say more about arthur said injured first unconsciously then consciously have tried to strike back hard be result let animosity be at end between go back to estate live there quietly for while then let memory of duel connected with pas away such matter be soon forgotten return to madrid will no longer be there in few month will be back in england now said in different tone where be men horse must have ridden here a have killed favourite must provide with be round next turn don silvio said can at least make reparation to in matter of horse for mine be a good a yours be will take one of others indeed be own what be to be done with body there be man with horse will get to throw over into gorge may be month before anyone find will lead four of best of horse back others can be left for first comer man will be trouble to in future will not be steward devoted to family be who arranged for service of men at town twelve mile from place fetched over provided with horse will not be missed from home indeed town will have reason to rejoice over disappearance by time roper be sufficiently recovered to be able to stand be still good deal dazed bewildered arthur assisted to mount took saddle bridle off own horse carrying with leading roper horse followed count round corner here be group of nine horse ready saddled with tall old man standing beside raphael count said take saddle off horse put gentleman on to have have heavy lesson one

barrel just a be in act of striking down be only man think who have gun others used pistol now think of roper have strong suspicion by pain be feeling that one two of rib be broken felt very sharp pang for moment mail shirt kept bullet from penetrating did not keep from hitting very hard think will dismount now strip to waist get if feel up to to bandage tightly know always carry couple of bandage in valise oh be well enough for sir roper said dismounting then leaving horse went across to arthur assisted to dismount to take off coat shirt here be two bullet sir jammed tightly in coat of mail one be about inch above other be afraid two of rib be broken will make shift to bandage up a tightly a can will stop at next town can only be six seven mile away get surgeon to attend to properly will walk horse way must never do to trot when arthur have dressed again continued on journey at very quiet pace arrived two hour later at town put up at principal inn sent for surgeon who on examining arthur at once found that two rib be broken how long will be kept here will depend how quickly bone knit must say that ought to stay for at least three week possibly may go on before provided take matter quietly will of course bandage up so tightly that can not shift unless give wrench arthur be detained ten day at end of time insisted on proceeding be tightly enveloped in broad bandage a said felt a if be in stiff pair of stay promised surgeon that must not let horse go beyond walk however accomplished journey to saragossa at pretty fair rate travelling from eight to nine hour day making average of twenty five mile by time got there arthur longer felt acute pain be confident that bone be healing however resolved to follow surgeon advice not attempt to remove bandage for month found saragossa scene of great preparation espartero have determined not to move a oraa have done with insufficient siege train during month of comparative inactivity have collected battering train of forty piece of eight be pounder twelve pounder ten mortar ten howitzer gun be provided with thousand round of ammunition besides siege train have also with three field battery armed with heavy gun transport have be collected with immense difficulty for to carry ammunition alone five hundred cart two thousand mule be required besides waggon of commissariat train for regimental transport force be to accompany amounted to twenty thousand men while eight thousand others be posted on road a garrison in various village on th of may battering train moved forward be followed next day by main body first division advanced to height of san marcos within sight of morella main body with head quarter artillery halted few mile short of on height above pobleta during night weather changed suddenly very heavy snow storm set in several men mule be frozen to death there be change on next day on rd army again advanced arrived early in afternoon within range of fort of san pedro halted about two thousand yard from town on north side fort stood on commanding height be surrounded by deep ditch on south west side be inaccessible on north front be well covered by glacis only exposed face be visible from height called san marcos at distance of thousand yard on same level on opposite side of valley owing to distance at san pedro stood from city cabrera have since last siege erected strong redoubt called la querola to protect communication have made great mistake however in not erecting fortification on height facing la querola two must have protected other fire crossing road between must have enabled to hold out even against powerful artillery brought against for at least fortnight cabrera however who be engineer instead of covering approach with fortification have wasted much time in forming entrenchment in town must be of little use after entry be once made be still suffering from effect of wound arthur have inflicted upon be unable to undertake defence of place when besieging army drew near left town with eight thousand men in order to harass communication interfere a far a possible with progress of siege espartero found that be necessary to take la querola before city must be attacked because commanded road by siege artillery be brought up there be too in valley along road ran aqueduct supplied city with water behind large body of troop must form up without being seen from city be also desirable that must be effected because weakest part of wall be between castle gate of san miguel be breach effected there whole of interior entrenchment must be commanded from army encamped in front on flank of san pedro store heavy gun being placed on height of san marcos on th of may engineer commenced approach against north front of san pedro artillery on opposite height opened fire upon work of sapper be arduous incessant musketry fire be kept up upon ground be so rocky that be very difficult to obtain shelter finding therefore that approach must not be made in regular way sapper went forward at run to within two hundred yard of fort then covered by hurriedly throwing up stone wall behind kept up so rapid heavy fire that silenced that of defender during night carried forward work to within hundred yard of wall completed little battery of three pounder be to fire at very small part of work be not covered by glacis opened fire at daybreak did very little damage be otherwise however on eastern side where wall be so effectually pounded by heavy gun on opposite height that whole of parapet on face be destroyed there be therefore shelter for defender of light troop seeing crept up close to ditch defender thinking that assault be intended rushed to oppose suffered terribly from fire from san marcos again again exposed in most gallant manner fire from gun be so excellent that fell in great number at eight o'clock garrison sounded parley governor offered to surrender on condition that survivor must be permitted to retreat to morella espartero refused a garrison must not longer continue hopeless defence governor surrendered at discretion in meantime espartero have moved light infantry against la querola newly raised fort built to keep up communication between san pedro city garrison here showed none of same spirit have animated defender of san pedro notwithstanding assistance rendered by strong sortie from morella resisted attack for only hour then abandoned fort being cut up a retired by espartero cavalry thus way be opened for advance of besieger to neighbourhood of city whole army moved forward natural ridge at distance of from seven to eight hundred yard from city covered movement here battery be at once commenced by th be ready thirty five gun be in position tremendous fire be opened against town mortar did not effect expected damage for town be almost entirely composed of stone few house be set on fire destruction wrought by other gun be however very great wall between castle gate of san miguel crumbled rapidly while fire from castle be almost wholly silenced very destructive explosion took place in one of principal magazine northern defence of castle be almost destroyed communication must no longer be held by daylight between town at half past two in afternoon officer let down by rope from western wall informed espartero that meeting of principal officer of town have be held that have be determined that troop in city must night endeavour to escape through besieging army join cabrera who be with field force very ill garrison of castle be to remain cover escape of comrade espartero at once took precaution to frustrate attempt to escape directing incessant fire to be kept up by gun despatched officer to different division to order that investment have not hitherto be complete must at once be carefully closed at troop must draw nearer to town occupy in force road particularly that towards gate of puerta del estudio alone have not be blocked before siege began a however be by mean certain that information brought by deserter be true directed erection of two new battery at north west angle of wall while battery be erected at south west side of city couple of field battery being also sent round there at ten o'clock in evening fire be opened round morella seemed to show that information have be received be correct that outburst of firing be intended to show that garrison be vigilant active at dawn troop ignorant that scheme have be betrayed marched down headed by governor to surprise be encountered by overwhelming force in hasty struggle ensued three hundred fifty of carlists be made prisoner rest of column endeavoured to regain town shell fell on drawbridge destroyed terrible scene now ensued great many of wife child of troop have marched out with believing that road be perfectly clear be pressed back by retreating troop number of men woman child be forced into moat soon became filled with mass of struggling suffocating people to add to horror of scene of garrison who still remained within wall hearing shout of christinos viva la reyna fired miscellaneously in panic upon friend foe at six o'clock in morning officer second in command now acting a governor sent out to offer to capitulate on condition that garrison must be allowed to withdraw to foreign country be peremptorily refused by espartero at eight o'clock place surrendered unconditionally remainder of garrison marched out piled arm under castle number exceeding three thousand in city castle magazine be found stored with provision sufficient to enable to hold out for several month defence be on whole quite unworthy of tradition of carlists in fact little garrison of san pedro alone behaved well there must be doubt that defender have be cowed by overwhelming power of siege artillery have relied upon being able to repulse assault might be made be utterly unprepared for bombardment such a have to endure there be precedent for collection of so great force of artillery at unsuccessful siege by oraa only eight to ten small piece have be used have be badly placed badly handled time have not even be allowed for to complete breach when therefore wall be swept by fire of fifty sixty gun garrison saw defence in one day crumble before thought only of escape lamentable part of affair be fearful destruction of life outside gate be worthy conclusion of struggle have be conducted on side with amount of ferocity brutality bloodshed altogether without precedent in modern warfare indeed to find parallel be necessary to go back to wholesale slaughter committed by alva in low country english officer after order be restored called upon espartero to congratulate on complete success two three of took leave of at once a be certain that although guerrilla skirmishing might still go on war be practically at end then rode back to hut have formed head quarter during siege general expression be that of joy that arduous thankless work be at end have be in case for year travelling almost constantly with flying column moved aimlessly through country remained for month together inactive without making effort to get in touch with enemy be not business to give advice unless be asked for mission be to endeavour to humanize war although at time one of commander must act with little humanity be quite exceptional case a rule little quarter be given on side insisting that atrocity be reprisal for act of other party in vain have british commissioner urged in name not only of humanity of good policy that custom of war must be followed that antagonist must not be excited to madness by wanton destruction of life wholesale devastation of country razing to ground of village homestead party admitted justice of reason bewailed necessity for such action continued to commit to end of war there be then feeling of deep satisfaction among three four british officer at capture of morella garrison a long a city remained in hand of carlists be rallying centre for reminder of signal defeat of army have besieged now have fallen after resistance must not be considered a feeble carlists have be true other stronghold in different part of country be comparatively insignificant must doubtless open gate a soon a detachment of espartero army appeared before indeed weakness of defence of morella showed that spirit of carlists be already broken have cabrera remained among to cheer encourage defence must have be much more desperate though must not have be very much more prolonged for day two must have seen defence so destroyed that place must have be untenable fact that cabrera be away wounded sick took spirit out of defence first offer of governor to surrender if garrison be allowed to march out cross foreign frontier be doubt result of order cabrera have given before left when found that be no longer able to defend place probably foreshadowed plan cabrera thought likely must be compelled to adopt espartero triumph have be complete have indeed proved saviour of spain when began one among dozen general found jealousy jobbery everywhere rampant most of general thought only of avoiding defeat not of gaining victory so long a carlists left alone be well content to allow to march almost at will through country army be ill clothed ill fed be wholly deficient in artillery have very small body of cavalry worst of government be rotten to core corruption prevailed in office position be only secured through favouritism merit counting not at little by little espartero changed honesty talent dogged perseverance triumphed over adversary people at large came to regard a one hope answered appeal to by overthrowing government have thwarted making towards end of war practically dictator of spain have along distinguished by courtesy with have treated british commissioner have relied great deal upon advice of colonel wylde who be senior of body have set a rule example of clemency to captive except when be driven by massacre of prisoner taken by carlists to carry out striking reprisal many of other general on other hand kept commissioner at arm length must not only give information ordered officer not to do so be not difficult to understand feeling actuated officer be unwelcome at head quarter not because be there to plead cause of humanity because furnished british government with accurate report of movement conduct of army thus exposed falsity of own bombastic report of doings for part be heartily glad be over arthur said certainly mean to remain to witness expulsion of cabrera stamping out of last ember of disaffection have have six year of intend to send in resignation a soon a arrive at madrid when came out be with intention of serving merely for term of enlistment couple of year then have good fortune to be transferred to army when legion be broken up though still thought that be for year so however have reason to regret have seen through have be fortunate in respect very fortunate in serving under so kind good chief a colonel wylde what be thinking of doing if leave army have small estate waiting for at home have be little by little piling up capital for during absence will be good deal more fit to take charge of now to settle down than must have be if have never come out here seems pity too colonel lacy said have done very good service colonel wylde have always reported well of have be captain now for four year will be sure to get majority a reward for work here yes sir if have entered army for purpose of staying in must have reason for congratulating on good fortune a did not must not value majority for indeed feel much too young besides must be altogether unfit for learned work of subaltern for year in hard rough school where there be occasion to know more than simplest movement for past four year have not commanded corporal guard must no more drill battalion of british troop on parade ground than fly so have quite made up mind to leave have indeed only held on for past two year in belief that war must speedily come to end well hallett of course know own business best be quite sure that if have nice little estate waiting for in england must take same course a be going to do chapter xxi home next day arthur mounted after saying good bye to friend started for madrid be still wearing bandage a measure of precaution rather than a necessity for bone have knit well be surgeon have told that must safely give up arthur however said that be accustomed to now a be great inconvenience must be folly to run smallest risk must therefore keep on for month roper be in high glee at thought that be going to return home when get to madrid arthur said will lay aside uniform will cease to be servant can return to position formerly occupied towards other that of good friend though of course much closer one than of old have gone through many danger together will only be matter of regret to that must have be in position of servant wo give up when get to madrid sir at rate will remain servant till embark on board ship for england after will have more occasion for will be proud to become humble friend suppose sir said with quiet smile be not thinking of going back to england alone not if can help arthur answered of course nothing be settled fancy that will have to go back alone if do will return shortly hope to manage everything satisfactorily before leave arthur have heard regularly six month from uncle who have of late said hoped must soon leave army return home in last letter written after have come of age have said may now tell dear arthur that will of father contains secret clause giving power if considered fit to undertake responsibility of handing estate over to when came of age must say that seems to be quite fit to assume that responsibility letter tell very great deal about be clear that a in five year have won way from being private to holding commission a captain ought certainly to posse sufficient amount of steadiness knowledge of world to fit for not very onerous duty of country squire toll very much about consider letter in respect very unsatisfactory be evident that have seen great deal of service must have cured of tendency to wildness caused such trouble before left in fact feel proud of holding a do appointment a one of british assistant commissioner own that have be surprise to wife declares that be always sure must do well need hardly say that girl be very fond of parading cousin captain in army royal commissioner in spain among acquaintance of course urge to return be question entirely for to decide say that in virtue of power given to by father will have hesitation in placing on return in possession of father estate accumulation of rent during minority communication be slow letter have only be received by arthur few day before seizure by monk have be great satisfaction to a must now be able to maintain mercedes in position not altogether inferior to to have be accustomed have however not spoken on subject even to leon preferring to continue to stand on same basis a before travelled by easy stage to madrid be most warmly greeted on return there by leon girl rather curious thing have happened since have be away leon said when be chatting together on first evening after return have received letter from don silvio understand be a far a go very satisfactory still can not quite make out writes to say that regret very deeply conduct towards implores pardon say that henceforth need fear annoyance whatever from that can only hope that day may resume former position a friend of family say that of course will have heard from reason have brought about entire change in sentiment that can easily understand that after treatment of be entirely changed man received letter fortnight ago really did not know how to answer so have waited to get explanation from a to circumstance have brought about change in sentiment in own have belief indeed consider that letter be only written to put off guard certainly in letter have written since left there have be nothing must explain matter except indeed that said have have trifling affair with brigand have got better of though at cost of slight wound have anything to do with have leon be not worth writing about although affair be somewhat sharp one have not intended to say anything about a have apparently brought about very satisfactory state of thing suppose have better tell then related how roper have a thought recognized don silvio how have discovered that be really watched precaution have taken against attack gave account of fight telling how seven men who have attacked have be killed in encounter don silvio fought hard said carelessly have at mercy reflecting however have injured by winning affection of mercedes have certainly behaved wrongly in fooling with in duel let go let go leon said in astonishment do mean to say that when have at mercy actually let go be what came to suppose arthur admitted have by throat at edge of precipice then occurred to that man have good ground for complaint against for might have married mercedes a over above have made laughing stock of madrid be natural that must have endeavoured to get rid of therefore concluded that ought not to take life so released explained to parted think very good friend leon gazed at in astonishment by san paolo arthur be extraordinary man idea of sparing that fellow when have at mercy astound be good of arthur wonderfully good mercedes exclaimed just thing that must do be proud of of course have always be proud of more now than ever do think be sincere in letter wrote to leon do think so from way in spoke to believe that be thoroughly sincere that felt that have be in wrong that feud between be now at end think leon can now answer letter saying that have seen heard explanation that be heartily glad that feud be over be ready again to receive a friend a to must be only too glad leon said until thing happened always esteemed a may suppose by consenting to give mercedes to have not injured if have brought to forgive attempt upon life be little enough for to shake hand with again will write tell so to morrow morning express willingness that bygone will be bygone that friendship can be again renewed now to return to still more interesting subject what be plan a have already told will to morrow send in resignation next step must necessarily depend upon great deal seems to that must be exceedingly difficult for mercedes to be married here ceremony must be performed at british embassy for part must much rather that took place in england must think leon that must also be most pleasant for marriage here must undoubtedly cause considerable amount of feeling must be blamed very strongly for giving sister to foreigner heretic thing might be made very unpleasant for girl own idea be that best thing possible must be for to travel quietly down to cadiz thence take ship to england there must be married comfortably while preparing for must see that place be made ready to receive then hope must stay with for time before returning home in way must avoid trouble here for whereas wedding in face of public of madrid must cause end of scandal quiet marriage in england must scarcely be noticed leon be silent for minute then said think good deal be to be said in favour of plan there can be doubt that marriage must create much le comment talk than if be to take place here secondly must like to see new home in mercedes be to be established not to say must certainly like to see something more of england know about girl oh leon exclaimed must never leave behind why of course must want just a much a do to be at mercedes wedding never can really think of leaving here what reason must there be why must go with well see in first place speak english do leon at least not well well know that in point of fact do speak pretty fairly however be too important matter to be settled offhand girl suppose for example that one of took into head to marry english gentleman well leon inez said mischievously a appears to that be likely before long to enter married state must have thought that must be very glad to get off hand even to englishman be sure if englishman be like arthur must have objection at have always be lamenting did not go with instead of mercedes to country place then perhaps might have have chance mercedes have have laughed well really will think over inez might be managed three month trip must do good after stormy time have be having here be sure must arthur said so think girl can consider settled well of course must not think of going for month yet mercedes said must remember that will have preparation to make can get thing made in england arthur urged sir mercedes said be not going away without sufficient supply of clothes at rate will want travelling suit lot of other thing though admit must prefer getting of dress in england want to have everyone staring at when go about a foreigner well of course must have time mercedes think month be very unreasonable besides sort of paper will have to be got ready drawn up certainly leon said a mercedes guardian head of family be duty to see that everything be done regularly a far a be concerned arthur must be quite content to have settlement of kind must be unseemly for daughter of house to marry in haphazard way of small farmer daughter agree with thoroughly leon think must be better for to have settlement drawn up in england may calculate that will be month after return before thing will be ready will give plenty of time for to have deed drawn up there see law of country be not same a ours must say have better be drawn up in country leon said mercedes income be charge upon spanish estate people acting a trustee here must be bound by spanish law only think that when trouble be over land rise in value again must be best that estate must be sold mercedes must then invest money in other girl share must be held in trust for till marry must certainly be very good plan leon will understand of course that wish mercedes fortune to be entirely under own control arthur spent very pleasant month in madrid be at regent request very frequently at palace when informed that mercedes be going to england to be married to presented with splendid suite of diamond see captain hallett said must not let do for quarter of what wished to do at least can not interfere between donna mercedes de balen wish greatly that have permanently settled here must have made grand duke of spain there must be pleasure in knowing that daughter must have one absolutely disinterested faithful friend own health be not good have have terribly anxious time for past eight year have be surrounded by men whom despise have seen how few of care for cause to profess to be devoted think only of own interest fortunately must anything happen to will leave in espartero hand with certain knowledge that will protect guard during minority trust sincerely madam that there will be occasion for to assume charge thoroughly agree with must have to do so will perform well honourably before leaving leon girl made formal farewell visit to friend knew that if intention be announced there must be storm of opposition that friend member of family with be connected must move heaven earth to try dissuade mercedes engagement have never be formally announced although attachment for arthur might be suspected by intimate of family nothing must be said until betrothal be made public at last preparation be complete
