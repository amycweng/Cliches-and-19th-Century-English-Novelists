visitor face a if to read character quite a well repeated rather more rapidly a if survey have be satisfactory one yes there be nothing like attending to business at once have always be rule fred bingham made gesture of impatience if will tell what want said will be glad have business of importance to attend to doubt doubt mr bingham hardly imagine of such importance a present a will be sure allow when have heard now mr bingham went on sharply decisively a if have now quite made up mind a to visitor character conclusion have arrived at be satisfactory will proceed to business be of men of world fred bingham did not like opening own experience have be universal that when two men agreed that be men of world be about to propose to carry out doubtful business must not bear rigid investigation only nodded however detective went on business relates to family matter again old fear came into fred binghams thought man who be watching saw instantly that there be sore point other in family affair be believe sir next of kin recognised heir of captain bradshaw of lowndes square of wyvern park in county of leicester may readily imagine that man of profession doe not ask such question from mere impertinent curiosity presume not fred bingham said coldly be mistaken cousin mr maynard be equally near relative with myselfindeed a son of elder sister be captain bradshaws nearest heir quite so mr barton said so understood be also awarefor in matter one of course make acquainted with particularsthat quarrel have arisen between captain bradshaw mr maynard that may now not unreasonably be regarded a sole heir be not aware of captain bradshaws intention with regard to disposal of property fred bingham said stiffly mr barton said a if surprised imagined that be at least be whisperedthese thing get whispered knowthat applied to party in city who will be nameless obtained heavyish loan on strength of expectation in quarter fred bingham coloured scarlet be about to speak when mr barton stopped pooh pooh dear sir dont be angry a men of world understand matter little affair in question be not known beyond very small circle of safe men if men did not mention matter to particular friend know accident might happen gentleman might borrow twice for instance from different party upon strength of expectation fred bingham bit lip for have only night before be meditating on possibility of such step a suggested did not speak mr barton went on think then that will assist to better understanding of position if assumejust assume knowthat be probable heir to captain bradshaws very large property now captain bradshaw have have unfortunate quarrel with cousin mr barton laid meaning stress upon word unfortunate fred bingham said hastily have nothing to do with quarrel of course not of course not mr barton said having not least doubt that have doubt of made mental note for future use fred bingham felt that thus far have have much worst of struggle said really see mr barton where conversation about family matter be leading to patience dear sir mr barton said composedly be coming to point now being a have assumed for sake of argument probable heir to very large property of captain bradshaw must be new somewhat unpleasant circumstance if person must appear being nearer relation than having consequently stronger claim upon affection in fact let suppose grandson fred bingham be relieved of fear have hitherto oppressed said angrily really mr barton can not enter upon such impossible conjecture suppose tell mr bingham that be not conjecture at fact that grandson be really in existence fred bingham for moment sat speechless then exclaimed fiercely must say be lie doubt must no doubt must mr barton said very composedly very natural too for that be true cousin captain bradshaws daughter ran away from home married died leaving child behind child be alive fred bingham sat in complete stupefaction have heard be true year ago of daughter of captain bradshaw possibility of child being in existence to step in between fortune have never entered mind did not doubt fact for bartons manner be too earnest to be doubted sat astounded crushed under unexpected disaster here mr barton went on quietly taking paper from drawer here be copy of register of marriage here be copy of baptism of infant must procurewere to point be nota copy of register of burial fred bingham sat for time in silence after first burst of surprise despair busy brain began to work again why did man come to instead of going to captain bradshaw to heir why did come to naturally because saw advantage in so doing because in fact must get more out of at least there be hope then when spoke word expressed thought have not finished mr barton of course come to with object of course that object be money now why do come to before go to why do suppose must pay more very good indeed sir like doing business in practical way thats what call practical talk can only give answer in word of own question came to simply because do believe must give more than either captain bradshaw grandson also mainly because when have agreed upon matter there be fear of going furtherit must not suit of for to get abroad now on other hand captain bradshaw grandson might refuse to pay relationship once disclosed lose hold upon if be to try to enforce claim must not go into court with clean hand be employed by captain bradshaw to trace daughter when told of death forgot to mention have left child see public might take wrong view of be even possible that might lose suit now with have none of inconvenience know if agree to pay will do so because be interest know will keep part of bargain because in event of opening lip public must know have acted in rather unprofessional underhand way must be spoken of in way must not like there be only one other point mr barton how be to know boy be still alive ah mr barton said approvingly do like to deal with man with head well on shoulder now have hit upon only weak point can not prove know young man see constantly without letting know can not prove to without having suspicion awakened how can must take word for tell be alive if sort of oath will satisfy will take cant say more than fred bingham rose can give answer now upon be new to must think over will call to morrow about same time went out got into cab have be waiting for back again to harley street drive quick fred bingham sat for hour in study that evening thinking over new unexpected impediment to hope to think of grandson of old man being alive just when everything looked so well be ever anything so frightfully unlucky however of course question be be worth while to buy man off not fred bingham have clear head considered possible argument must be urged upon side if refused to treat heir be produced what then captain bradshaw have have heard bitterly regretted treatment of mother must doubt receive boy with joy establish a heir of course must leave considerable sum to must feel bound to do so fred did not deceive uncle have never liked a have frank still must leave perhaps third of whole property suppose bought man off whole property be worth perhaps suppose gave for silence of course must pay well must be end of must find in man power if did so yes be real question agreement of course must be that must give bond to pay certain amount at uncle death provided uncle died ignorant of existence of grandson yes must be then must pay money in cash so that trace of transaction must be brought against must receive in exchange bond must barton have hold upon afterwards did not think so did not see how must have suppose produced grandson what then will must have left property to grandson must not have slightest claim must barton threaten to divulge compact must deny that ever existed barton must have proof to adduce over over again thought over again again arrived at same conclusion grandson must have claim barton must hold threat over head be not so very bad after with conclusion went to bed next day called again at mr bartons office interview be brief time how much do want to hold tongue estate be worth by what hear will charge ten per cent no fred bingham said if heir turn up must get at least third will give ten per cent upon rest come mr barton said have waited twenty year will take not farthing le very well fred bingham said payable of course at uncle death in event of nearer heir than appearing just so mr barton assented have drawn up bond on stamped paper up to figure be not put in will fill up owe robert barton sum of agree to pay upon death of captain bradshaw of lowndes square providing that nearer heir than to property be found supposing fred bingham said that uncle quarrel with leaf property to one else dont think be likely to let quarrel with mr bingham must do so rely upon for own sake to come here tell so frankly will then restore paper produce grandson fred

emotion be joy that frank be worthy of esteem love that must think of again a girlhood trusty friend a brother that might be year before met again be a nothing now even have known must never meet again must have be drawback to pleasure only cloud on sunshine be feeling of self reproach for having doubted still severe upon a be disposed to be for reason must not allow under circumstance must

back in corner of railway carriage to enjoy thought uncle be in most excitable mood be a glad a alice be that favourite be innocent of fault have so long be laid against be far more anxious than be a to chance of arresting journey gladness anxiety be alternated with burst of reproach against for having be so hasty in believing frank to have be guilty in fit of furious anger against fred bingham

hesitated speak out mr prescott want to know what poor frank really thought of well captain bradshaw only thing in frank must conceive that have displeased be in thwarting wish with regard to miss heathcote have hoped that have ceased to feel anger upon point before married when received letter only conclusion own own agreed with be that have brooded over matter until have become sort of hallucination with in fact that upon point have to speak frankly gone little out of mind held that opinion until saw at time grandson be discovered by way in spoke also by manner in miss heathcote expressed with regard to breach between frank saw that suspicion be altogether wrong that there be to altogether unknown perfectly inexplicable cause of complaint against frank be convinced at time that must be error have so perfect faith in frank have known so closely so intimately for so many year be so perfectly frank open with about may almost say thought be certain must wilfully have done nothing to forfeit esteem that of miss heathcote refused to explain be forced to put down to one of extraordinary mistake sometimes occur one can only leave to time to solve now hope captain bradshaw that will tell what supposed error of frank must have be will tell mr prescott remember coming one night to telling that frank have picked man up from almost underneath wheel of omnibus have have narrow escape of being run over yes remember perfectly name waslet seeahwalker just so mr little time after frank came in one evening told that have be to see mr walker that be superior person for station of life that have extremely pretty daughter be man of world mr prescott know how sort of thing end remember told that be certain to end badly that man either made fool of married rascal of seduced frank be at first inclined to laugh at advice at last owned that be right that girl be pretty loveable sort of girl that must be just a well perhaps that must not call again remember perfectly prescott said frank coming up to room telling know said uncle good old boy wont go there more really dont think did frank be a open a day must have be certain to mention to be sure be mr prescott like old fool a be doubted afterwards must confess have reason somewhere about year afterwards frank be married went off on travel well fortnight after man came to nearly out of mind said name be walker that daughter have be seduced by nephew under promise of marriage that have promised solemnly to marry secretly at once to make public at death thought must not be far off old man offered to show letter proving said that daughter have drowned at news of nephew marriage have just be down to see body now mr prescott appeal to how must doubt that frank maynard be miserable scoundrel prescott be perfectly thunderstruck must not be true sir will wager life be not true be true mr prescott proof be undoubted word old man uttered be truth except that be mistaken a to body for daughter after did not commit suicide be still alive now mr prescott what must miss heathcote think that frank maynard be utterly unworthy of esteem of course doubt what say captain bradshaw prescott said warmly have doubt be confident in proof have received only from frank maynards own lip will believe terrible charge against ah old man said sadly thats what ought to have done ought to have gone to frank said be charge will be own judge can after ever be anything to again then mr prescott must remember that much a loved frank maynard well a believed knew knew far more of than did father can know little of son private life familiar friend can judge much better than father can know what other doe there be secret between young men know young men a be old men only know a choose to be known see have advantage of knowing frank inner life consider capable of being assured must not do knowing frank only a old man know young one be obliged to believe evidence be true captain bradshaw telegram said have be

bullet in bodyid by gad sir id have flayed alive indeed must be great rascal captain bradshaw never liked always distrusted never gave credit for such villainy a for time longer talked matter over prescott soothed old man self condemnation by assuring that did not see that under circumstance must have doubted frank guilt ought to have seen sir ought at least to have given opportunity of defence so ought mr prescott frank be littlejust littleto blame too knew how loved ought to have conquered pride to have insisted upon knowing precisely what be charged with ah if have answered letter
