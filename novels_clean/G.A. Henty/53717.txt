there be doubt what fate must be however at present great men be too intent upon quarrelling with other to trouble about especially a know that place be not to be taken without hard knock moreover although who take service with foreign prince have claim whatever for protection from own countryman fact of being englishman be to extent safeguard however want to put case fairly before if come out here will do best for will try to fill a far a can father place at same time warn that position here be perilous one that there be predicting how matter may turn out own opinion be however that people

promotion be man life percy to man of spirit worth hundred existence at home if knew personally must form better idea a to whether ought to say to stay where be come here father say that think have fair share of pluck determination that considers to be a sharp shrewd a most boy of age a be last man in world to speak one word beyond what considered due take that estimate of character be in way too flattering think over percy can thrash most fellow own age can run a far a fast a most of can take caning without whimpering over do feel in fact that be able to go through fully a much a of companion be good at planning piece of mischief ready to take lead in carrying out for though such gift a recommend boy to favour of schoolmaster be worth more out here than knowledge of dead language be pluck endurance downright love of adventure danger have made master of greater part of india will ere long make ruler of whole of be of use anyone coming out here especially to take service with one of native prince unless be disposed to love danger for own sake to feel that be willing ready to meet from quarter may come however there be occasion for to make up mind at present upon more than point whether will come out to for three four year when will be time enough to make final decision in case may always consider affectionate uncle roland percy read letter through very carefully be something like what have expected for father have in last day spoken much to of brother be cut out for life have led percy have said to be leader in mischief at school have amount of energy life must not have made good officer in king service for be impatient of authority must have be at loggerhead with adjutant perhaps with colonel in time once set mind to do thing must do whatever be straight forwardness loyal nature must certainly win for confidence of of indian prince accustomed a be to being surrounded with intriguer ready at time to take side with most powerful to sell to highest bidder will tell frankly whether think have better come out to stay at home mind if do go out will expect good deal of if do credit to a well a to will have hesitation in packing off home again at hour notice percy be pleased to see that although warned of difficulty danger of position uncle clearly did wish to come out to have hesitation whatever in making decision after reading letter for third time placed in pocket went across to doctor expected grove latter said when be shown into study so uncle be willing to receive leaf choice entirely to yourself be what messrs sims hammond said in letter to evidently think very foolish business say that a be bound by instruction have only to carry out if decide to go hope that will use influence to induce to decide upon remaining here have intention of doing so be for father to make choice made know country know uncle character a thought opening good one for feel that lie within province to influence decision way need hardly ask what decision be know that have be looking forward to receipt of letter ardour with have worked at hindustani a master tell show that wish lay in direction so have made up mind to go yes sir uncle doe not try to persuade to come say that will be very glad to have with life in fortified castle with lot of retainer like feudal baron say then be quite sure more need be said doctor replied smiling think boy must withstand prospect of living in fortified castle now suppose want to go see solicitor if please sir very well will give leave off school afternoon if find that there be ship sailing shortly will have many preparation to make a be quite sure thought will be too occupied to think of lesson may consider at end if however find will be little time before be able to sail will expect to put matter altogether out of head until time approach to work a hard a can though will give up latin can devote entirely to hindustani let see when return from lawyer know way to london bridge cross anyone meet will then direct to fenchurch street have better have dinner before start messrs sims hammond did not conceal from percy opinion that decision to go out to join uncle savoured of lunacy be willing to carry out father instruction senior partner said shrugging shoulder considered duty to express opinion frankly on subject to having done that without avail duty in matter be at end find not unusual thing for client to prefer own opinion to ours not unfrequently to own cost since have received uncle communication yesterday have made inquiry a to vessel loading for calcutta find that indiaman deccan will sail in ten day time will take be sufficient time for to make preparation one of clerk will at once go with to take berth then accompany to outfitter to get be requisite father left with list of clothing other matter considered must be required in event of going five minute later percy set out in charge of elderly clerk by close of afternoon passage be taken whole of outfit ordered percy walked back to dulwich quite overwhelmed at extent of wardrobe that father have deemed necessary for for voyage several suit of clothes have in accordance with instruction on list be ordered of size considerably too large for at present major grove have appended note to list saying that did not consider necessary that large stock of such clothes must be provided a there must be difficulty in having made in india that moreover percy must probably to extent wear native attire ten day passed rapidly percy although nominally free from school room nevertheless worked with ardour at hindustani have made great progress grove teacher said on last day must advise strongly to work several hour day at during voyage of passenger who be returning to india be sure to have with native servant ayah have best take opportunity of speaking with must remember that there be large number of dialect even of distinct language in india be probable that will find hindustani of little use to in northern india still will greatly facilitate learning other language most of educated native understand a like french on continent be general medium of communication between native of different part of country possibly may find among servant on board native of northern india may be able to commence study of punjaubi with two day before vessel sailed percy went by appointment to lawyer office mr hammond took to shipping office introduced to captain of deccan will give eye to lad a far a can mr hammond captain grierson said though to tell truth must almost a lief have monkey a boy to look after still feel responsibility a great a of young lady passenger do what may will indulge in flirtation have to bear brunt of anger of relative to whom be consigned in india when discover that charge have already disposed of on voyage during last day percy be object of greatest envy admiration of school fellow to be going way out to india by be in splendid idea that be to live in castle with armed retainer possibility of siege other sort of unknown danger seemed almost too great stroke of good fortune to fall to lot of anybody most of effect have be sent direct on board deccan have obtained from store where have be deposited case containing father rifle double barrelled gun pistol fact that be possessor of such arm greatly heightened admiration of companion even knowledge that pistol be in cabin other arm stowed below with greater portion of belonging scarcely sufficed to keep up spirit a stood solitary rather forlorn boy on deck of great ship a warped out through dock gate doctor have come down early to see on board have be obliged to return at once to duty at school everyone seemed to have friend to see off entrance to dock be crowded with people waving handkerchief shouting adieu to on board while many who be to land at gravesend be on deck chatting with friend captain stopped good naturedly by side for moment a passed along alone grove eh will soon make friend think be really better off than who have got over saying last good bye yet always think be much better to finish sort of thing at home instead of prolonging pain here harcourt called to young fellow about sixteen in midshipman dress have anything to do just at present give eye to youngster be going out to join uncle in india be alone on board introduce to other midshipman when get opportunity have told steward to mess with will be much more comfortable there than must be with people in cabin aft will like arrangement wo grove very much indeed sir percy said feeling a if great load have be lifted off mind harcourt led down between deck to ward room a called where third fourth officer four midshipman messed be palace grove bit of hole in comparison with saloon snug little den too when everything be going on well everyone be in good temper will tell others that skipper have made free of third fourth officer be good fellow think will find comfortable if have got saloon to fall back upon be sure to find comfortable percy said confidently have come fresh from school know be not accustomed to luxury must find miserable among grown up people only wish be going out a midshipman instead of passenger so a to have something to do ah well can talk to skipper about perhaps will put on watch if ask say work be very lively for be know must be very sorry to have to make voyage with nothing to do walk about with hand in pocket however must go on deck now have breakfast long ago dine at two bell be one o'clock if ca hold on until then will get steward to bring biscuit can hold on very well have cup of tea something to eat before left percy followed harcourt on deck again feeling now more settled a to position be able to look on with interest pleasure at what be being done around passenger have settled little have got out chair be seated chatting in group lady for most part be below arranging cabin men in couple walked up down waist smoking leaned against bulwark discussing voyage mutual acquaintance most of sail have now be set for wind be favourable great ship be running fast down river be just passing woolwich sailor bare footed with trouser turned up to knee be sluicing deck with water others be coiling up rope others again dressed more in accordance with percy idea a to neatness of sailor costume be standing at sheet brace in readiness to trim sail to port starboard a sharp turn of river brought wind on one quarter other percy be surprised at silence reigned among so many men understood reason when sharp order be shouted from quarter deck where first officer be standing by side of pilot then there be hauling of rope creaking of block towering pile of yard sail swung over now then ship course be suddenly changed to avoid barge smaller craft got in way sometimes missing by smallest margin running down on one two of occasion mate shouted angrily down at in charge of craft shouted a angrily back again once past erith river widened danger of collision ceased for craft be proceeding in same direction for stream be now running too strongly for barge to attempt to make way against even by hugging shore keeping in back water at twelve o'clock luncheon bell rang passenger disappeared from deck percy be so absorbed in watching shore that be quite surprised when harcourt touched on shoulder said there be two bell youngster must keep ear open will be missing meal for ring for anyone who doe not turn up to grub go without voyage be very pleasant one to percy grove captain did not allow to act a volunteer midshipman be not long before ceased to regret decision for found among four five native servant returning to india with master one from punjaub man duty on board occupied very small portion of time a have little to do except wait on master at meal be very glad to arrange for what seemed to percy ridiculously small sum to spend five six hour day in conversation with accordingly after breakfast dinner two took seat up in bow percy on low stool native squatted beside there spent hour at first in learning punjaubi equivalent for hindustani word then a time went on in conversation illustration percy learns punjaubi language native knew little hindustani must get on fairly in english so that be able from first to comprehend other a percy former study helped materially picked up punjaubi quickly by end of voyage be able to express in with considerable freedom be always up early in morning until breakfast time chatted with officer midshipman off duty sometimes with early riser among passenger two three of whom when found that lad be first class passenger on way out to india to join uncle became very friendly with being struck with steady way in passed greater portion of day in preparing a far a possible for life be about to lead why come aft grove one of asked must feel altogether strange sir two officer midshipman be very kind friendly live very well there feel much more at home than must do with lady have not be accustomed to lady remember mother for year lived altogether at school after father came back lived at home with only gentleman came to house like very much must not like to change besides if got to know good many passenger might not be able to spend so much time in work do so want when join uncle to be able to be useful to must not be if did not know anything of language well be sure grove uncle ought to be pleased when join to know how hard have worked must be very good thing if young cadet writer who went out must do a do prepare for work out there instead of wasting six month in lounging about trying to make agreeable to woman on board must not only find very useful out there must find very profitable for young fellow who on arrival be able to speak one of language pretty fluently must be certain to attract notice of authority must find in responsible well paid berth while others be kept at desk in calcutta bombay sent out a assistant to unimportant post be servant who be teaching tell that be making wonderful progress that already know a much of language a many officer who have be in india for year can tell too that must not have taken up more useful dialect than punjaubi at present of course punjaub be independent consequence be there be very few official who have taken trouble to learn language one doubt that time be not very far distant when will have to interfere there in few year may have to take over altogether in case need hardly say that there will be great demand for official able to speak language must enter company service must have chance of obtaining post there of greater importance profit than must hope to reach after year of service under ordinary condition be stationed in province south of sutlej sikh at rate consider to be part of punjaub be pretty well acquainted with what be going on at lahore know uncle personally although of course know well by reputation be one of best of european officer in sikh service although like others be dismissed at bidding of mutinous soldiery have always heard spoken well of be popular among men of two regiment that commanded bore excellent reputation among native generally abstaining from high handed exaction by of foreign officer amassed large sum of money be said to have be prompt in action to have maintained excellent order amongst men to have protected native against act of plundering misconduct district where be stationed be contented prosperous like most of other foreign officer held altogether aloof from court intrigue doubtless be perfectly right in doing so for a matter have turned out might have be better for punjaub have officer gone beyond duty thrown whole weight into scale in favour of strong man who must have put stop to dissension that if continue will certainly bring ruin upon country however position be very difficult one sikh chieftain be always adverse to runjeet singh policy of europeanizing army be extremely jealous of favour extended to european in service consequently position of officer be from moment of death extremely delicate one moreover be probable that indian authority must have viewed with considerable disfavour passing of affair of punjaub into hand of european adventurer of whom only two three be english foreigner of course must have have sympathy whatever with aim must indeed have be formidable opponent in case of trouble interest lying entirely in maintenance of present state of thing in punjaub be going out to most troubled portion of india youngster almost wonder at uncle allowing to come for there will be great convulsion there before matter finally settle down so told when wrote sir be only going out to till get old enough to go into army to enter company service if father friend can obtain commission writership for get writership boy if have chance civil service be vastly better paid than military well may be that will be thrown together again out there be nearly time for commissioner at loodiana to go home for furlough think very probable that will be appointed to post during absence in case be pretty certain to be in communication with uncle may be that when time come will be able to lend helping hand to enter service if stick to work a be doing now will certainly feel justified in recommending a one who must prove valuable young officer in punjaub if become master on frontier if country still maintains independence in meantime if there be trouble in punjaub have to fly for life remember will find hearty welcome at voyage be free from incident of importance deccan rounded cape without experiencing unusually bad weather except for one two minor gale weather be fine throughout voyage most of passenger be delighted when dropped anchor at last in hooghly much a percy longed to see wonder of india be almost sorry when voyage came to end for time have passed very pleasantly to have be especially case towards latter portion for study have increased in interest a acquired knowledge of language by end of voyage have come to know good many of passenger first friend mr fullarton have spoken warmly to others in favour of quiet lad of whom caught sight when happened to stroll forward to smoke cigar occupied so intently upon conversation with native beside hate book worm one of have said when mr fullarton have first spoken to on subject give lad with pluck spirit care snap of finger whether can construe euripides solve problem in high mathematics what want for india be men who can ride shoot who be ready at moment to start on hundred mile journey on horseback who will scale hill fort with handful of men with dozen sowars tackle dacoit band what do native care for learning be pluck fighting power have made master be very true lyndhurst thoroughly agree with that of way of choosing official for india examination must be very worst lad be not bookworm at in sense of word know that will be of great advantage to when arrives in india to be able to speak language have accordingly set to do with dogged perseverance must do credit to man look how have utilized voyage while cadet ensign young civilian have thrown away six month of life in absolute idleness besides be sure boy doe not lack pluck spirit be up good deal earlier than be in morning see going about rigging like monkey be quite a much at home up there a be of midshipman of whom have be four five year at sea saw sky larking other evening with two three of can tell quite held own be certainly favourite with officer must be ready to wager when time come will turn out well whatever circumstance may fall upon be merry fellow too have one of most infectious laugh ever heard be more like ideal book worm than be only time that percy came aft mixed with other passenger be when practised rifle pistol shooting sometimes at empty bottle thrown into sea sometimes at bottle swinging from one other of yardarm amusement be practised three four time week for be matter of importance to man military civilian to be good shot be useful in hunting of tiger other big game life might depend upon proficiency with pistol if attacked by fanatic in brush with dacoit while for men likely to be engaged with fierce tribesman of hill in conflict with sikh beloochee pathan afghan quick eye steady hand be essential encouraged by mr fullarton percy got out pistol on first day when practice began never missed opportunity afterwards never mind rifle friend said be not likely to do tiger hunting at present will have plenty of time opportunity for later on stick to pistol practice be going among wild set of people where knife be readily drawn in quarrel where men hesitate to rid of foe rival by assassination practise with pistol steadily on occasion here keep up afterwards may be of more use to than everything have learnt at school from day when first went there know approve of sticking to punjaubi can well spare hour three four time week although may do more good in future career to be good linguist than to be good pistol shot last may be mean of saving life unless can do study of language will be so much time thrown away so by end of voyage percy became very fair shot with pistol indeed there be few of passenger who must break swinging bottle more frequently than be surprised when anchor dropped at eagerness evinced by majority of passenger to get on shore looked on quietly for captain have said to early that morning there be use in hurrying ashore grove know one there hour earlier later will make difference to will be going off afternoon will take with after have be to shipping office will go with to people have letter for know personally introduction from will probably interest more in than will formal letter lawyer fellow be likely to have written captain introduction be of great benefit to percy agent took interest in put up at house for fortnight at end of time arranged for to take passage up country in native craft two three officer have chartered to convey to delhi beyond town there must be difficulty in hiring boat to point at must disembark thence travel up by road enjoyed journey much although occupied considerable time must have gone very much faster by road time be particular object agent thought that must be cheated right left in bargain for vehicle might not improbably have of baggage stolen percy greatly preferred passage by river when finally have to take to close vehicle congratulated that have accomplished greater part of journey free from dust heat inconvenience of land travel learned that must have done much better have taken passage from england to other side of india ascended indus supposed that uncle have directed to come via calcutta because own agent be there must make arrangement for perhaps considered that passage thence by water must be much safer than one through recently conquered province of scinde be indeed a afterwards learnt reason why calcutta have be chosen instead of bombay there have about time uncle wrote be number of robbery sometimes accompanied by murder of person travelling up indus in boat be for reason longer safer route up jumna have be chosen left boat at sultanpoor have about hundred mile of travel thence through umballah sirhind to loodiana station in what be known a protected district here on frontier of punjaub be stationed british troop with resident whose special duty be to keep government informed of what be going on upon other side of sutlej agent have advised on arrival at loodiana to go straight to residency be probable that uncle will have written to resident about coming instruction a to best course for pursuing journey may be awaiting there be long way from loodiana to place lie quite in north of punjaub short distance from afghan frontier will know about what time will arrive may even have sent down one of officer to accompany on way must not of course guess that must know of language must be impossible for speaking nothing english to make way alone through punjaub even a be must advise must on arriving at loodiana find one there from uncle to send up word that have arrived to wait quietly even if be month till hear from chapter ii shadow of war leaving cart with luggage short distance away percy entered office of residency giving name to clerk said that be desirous of speaking to resident clerk on return from inner room requested percy to follow officer be sitting at desk looked up with smile a lad entered percy be astonished to see mr fullarton to whom have said good bye on board deccan did not expect to see here grove said a shook cordially by hand indeed sir have not slightest idea that have left calcutta be glad indeed to see only stopped there few hour officer said a soon a got to

percy went down to dinner be pleased to find alone with mr fullarton who in course of evening told much more than have hitherto known of state of affair in punjaub thing look very bad said be possible that may go on for month even year before crisis come a to however uncle will be able to tell more than can mine be of course official view of matter gleaned from report of men in pay at lahore other place in punjaub report of such men however be always open to grave suspicion a take bribe from may take bribe from others may be be in way interested in deceiving uncle will doubtless be much better informed although have taken active part in plot conspiracy have be continually going on ever since death of runjeet singh must have be more le behind scene throughout will certainly have tried trusted agent at lahore at present be only interested in matter a far a concern safety of uncle still be always useful in country like to have insight into what be going on around must there be trouble remember that sikh value courage quickness decision above thing be not supposing for moment that be likely to show white feather still may be involved in danger must shake nerve of hardened men thing to remember be always to assume air of courage coolness to show weakness must forfeit respect of own people must in way alter fate must befall if fell into hand of foe know old saying 'assume virtue if have not ' that must be alarmed in position must be only natural must if possible conceal fact must nerve to put on a great air of coolness indifference a can muster remember there be very few men who feel horribly uncomfortable when exposed to great danger bravery exists not so much in having feeling of fear a of concealing expression of when hear man boasting that have never felt fear that enjoys being under fire take word for be liar in heat of battle especially in excitement of cavalry charge sensation of fear be lost in preliminary stage never knew man yet who speaking honestly must not confess that felt horribly nervous will not keep up longer have have long journey to day must be early in bed will be called before daybreak for may be sure men will be here before sun be up will be gratified to find that be prepared to be off need not repeat now what told on board ship must have to fly for life will meet with warm welcome here be still dark when percy be aroused by ram singh be time to get up sahib have water boiling there will be cup of tea ready for a soon a have have bath bheesti be outside with water skin right percy said jumping out of bed send in taking bath consisted of squatting down in corner of room where floor be made to slope to hole carried off water poured from skin over head of bather a dressed percy drank cup of tea ate couple of biscuit while ram singh packed up trunk again have just finished when heard trampling of horse at once went out be in good time nand chund must not have done to have kept sahib waiting sikh said though scarce expected to find ready for so soon then ordered baggage horse to be brought up four strong pony be led forward percy trunk have be made of size suited to such transport be firmly lashed one on side of saddle when be done handsome horse be brought forward for percy be about to turn to enter house to say good bye to mr fullarton who have night before told must be up before started when resident made appearance always rise before sun said take drive ride be back before get too hot for pleasure then have bath change of clothes be ready for work early morning evening be only time that life be enjoyable here unless one take exercise then one can not expect to keep in health good bye grove tell uncle to keep informed of what be going on whenever get opportunity take care of come keep head clear wit sharpened many life be thrown away from want of prompt decision at critical moment percy shook hand with kind friend then leapt into saddle without putting foot into stirrup trick have learned at riding school murmur of approval ran through men who muttered to understands horse brisk young fellow will do discredit to lord then took place by side of nand chund waved hand to mr fullarton started companion at once put horse to hand gallop surely mean to travel far at speed percy said pack animal will not be able to keep up with will follow sahib see have left four men in charge of yes have eight men here where be other four for counted sixteen yesterday started before dark sahib with four other baggage animal two of will find when halt for food when sun get high will have pitched tent in shade of tree will have meal cooked in readiness for other two will have gone forward to point where will rest for night have tent will have evening meal in readiness so will be day will travel by night by day at end of three day will have reached point where care will be necessity will then travel in body from whom have reason to fear danger percy asked fear danger sikh replied prepare to meet in first place there be robber band of men who acknowledge master such a deserter from army fugitive who have excited enmity of powerful chief criminal who have escaped justice such men form band rob village plunder well to do peasant waylay rob murder traveller be ordinary foe who journey have to prepare for be not really dangerous to well armed party then again there be band by profession robber who be for time hired by powerful wealthy sirdar who wish to gratify private spite openly perhaps must not dare to move therefore remains in background hire band of robber to do business such band be far more formidable than composed of ordinary marauder for be of strength proportioned to object have to accomplish may even number hundred be against whom have to take precaution lord uncle have powerful enemy doubtless employ spy be made aware of pass in stronghold must have learned that be expecting arrival must of course see that capture must be valuable one a must work on through at rate departure of band be sure to be noticed though travelled by circuitous route may probably have be tracked to loodiana besides might think that have important mission to british resident there may be bearer of letter might enable to work master ruin so will spare pain to wrest from for first three day follow route leading to lord stronghold consequently there be little fear of ambush during last five day of journey when be making for fortress will have to sleep with one eye open to travel by unfrequented road for most part by night colonel must have come to meet in first place visit to loodiana must be seized upon by enemy a proof that be leagued with british in second presence be required in castle where so long a be present there be little fear of sudden surprise attack be away traitor might corrupt guard open gate thus let in troop of enemy there be civil war nand chund how then must chief venture to attack uncle there be war sikh repeated sirdar never hesitate to collect follower attack rival when have chance even in day of runjeet singh be so for although hand be heavy one be easy to bribe about to place matter in favourable light handsome present must do rest since lion have passed away there have be power in land government have be feeble great sirdar have done a plea so there be everywhere rapine confusion who be strong take from who be weak trader who prospered grew rich in old day now fly land bury wealth assume appearance of poverty market be deserted town flourishing under runjeet be now well nigh deserted why have special animosity against uncle first because be european secondly because be wealthy thirdly because who fly from extortion tyranny of others find refuge with lastly because district under charge be flourishing prosperous while others be impoverished merchant elsewhere clamour for right that give under protection for tax a light a imposed by in district thought that european have be deprived of command percy said be true in country man only surrender profitable post when can no longer hold even runjeet singh order to governor to surrender post to others be often disobeyed be obliged to march army to enforce be far more so now three year ago lord be nominally deprived of command of district a well a of troop by order of court at lahore be too wise to obey have opened gate must assuredly have be taken prisoner to lahore there have be put to death so held on none have cared to undertake work of turning out still man appointed a successor be may be sure only waiting opportunity belongs to family of one of most powerful of prince one who must put ten thousand men in field colonel have nearly two thousand good soldier such strong wall that with must repulse open attack by three time that number besides district be in favour dread nothing so much a that must take place news that army be advancing must at once swell force by three thousand fighting men moreover have ally among hill tribe who have never save under pressure of force acknowledged authority of lahore be not until rival relation have made compact with sirdar equally powerful that be likely to attack openly treachery however be always to be feared still more knife of assassin believe that soldier can be trusted to man who can tell gold be very powerful among two thousand there must be who must sell dearest friend be bribe sufficiently large say that power of noble be broken that be army be master percy remarked be so soldier be lord of punjaub runjeet singh policy be to strengthen army under foreign officer be always faithful to after death there be strong hand force old lion have trained to conquer foe turned upon country became master clamoured for dismissal of foreign officer for increase of pay for right to choose own leader thing obtained there be longer discipline order oppress people dictate term to court can make unmake maharajah if at present be quiet be because have everything can ask for thus then there be one to control sirdar who can do a plea if only keep on good term with leader of army must matter little when wish to attack other have to buy service of regiment two thing be done there lie danger of lord most hostile to must not dare to attack with own follower will sooner later obtain assistance of of military chief more so that be hostile to lord because be foreigner at present cry be death to foreigner be only because colonel have so good name in army for knew that although nowhere be discipline more strict be always just kindly that man be punished without cause that have favourite that oppressed none used influence possessed with old maharajah to obtain pay for men regularly that military chief have so far failed to get soldier to consent to movement against besides troop be aware that be brave leader know that men will die in defence therefore must need higher bribe than usual to induce to risk life in struggle from must gain nothing be far easier to revolt for extra pay than to obtain money by attack on colonel fortress thus for aught know may be year before serious trouble come will depend upon what event occur at present soldier be well content to hing eat drink at expense of people in time will become restless then who know may attack plunder strong place may make war upon english believe that be invincible have immense number of gun think that because sikh have conquered cashmere wrested territory from afghan hold country north of sutlej nothing can withstand know nothing be ignorant man a to thing outside country know that english conquered scinde although sirdar soldier be many brave that made master of afghanistan even after great misfortune there came back again took cabul punished afghan say to myself why must sikh want to fight people who interfere with who have always respected treaty have made with old lion who feared one who spread rule far wide always kept friend with english although most of chief must have taken advantage of trouble in afghanistan to go to war with knew power of foreigner be always ready to engage white officer to teach soldier have wiser head than of soldier who be now ready to raise cry of war with english know lord opinion be must engage in struggle with people will assuredly be beaten what avail be thing with men puffed up with pride with belief that be invincible be certain that day other army will clamour for war with english who be there to say nay not boy maharajah dhuleep singh ranee mother guardian then will see how thing will go there be doubt how thing will go percy said english will conquer country a have other part of india have tried strength with have never fought country like ours officer said little proudly army be hundred fifty thousand strong chief must join so there will be two hundred thousand at least good fighting men be well armed have vast store of gun ammunition have be taught to fight in european fashion be told that if british troop in india came against must number scarce fifty thousand may be percy agreed must win always have won often against odds quite a great besides when two hundred thousand men be in field must have whole fighting power while if be necessary england must send out army after army a strong a now in india how far be to first halting place sun be beginning to get very hot be three hour ride from loodiana going at easy pace will be there in hour percy be heartily glad when companion pointed out yellow speck under clump of tree told be tent brought with only small tent such a soldier use on expedition said so a to excite le attention be mere shelter from sun night air be want nand chund weigh only few pound sahib can be carried by horseman in addition to ordinary baggage have three four of with so that can at time pitch one must arrive at halting place before baggage animal quarter of hour later percy be lying under shade of tent side of be tied up to permit air to pas freely through in short time tiffin be served consisting of excellent pillau of fowl dish of meat prepared with savoury condiment followed by assortment of delicious fruit drink consisted of water cooled in porous jar flavoured with juice of slightly acid fruit must have brought wine officer said apologetically lord uncle said that must not be accustomed to that riding in sun be better must take only cooling liquor have sent however tin filled with herb that with hot water make drink of be very fond be sent up to in chest from calcutta said must know what to do with call tea be glad of percy said there be difficulty in preparing need boiling water poured over will have evening be very fond of too be accustomed to drink with sugar milk have sugar man said milk will be difficult to obtain master never us with tea will get accustomed to percy said though be sure sha' like so well at first at what time do move on again in about six hour if so plea be ten o'clock now by four sun will have lost of power how many hour ride will have three hour at canter be doing short journey to day a be first after will never be le than eight hour in saddle be if be not too much for oh be not too much percy replied will feel rather stiff for first day two after not having ridden for so many month certainly must be glad to travel a much a possible in evening can do sahib for will have moon for next week how many day will take altogether be now mile from aliwal where will cross sutlej will encamp to night near sultanpoor a told be to day travelling a if going to lahore to morrow will strike north will camp near adinanagar next morning will cross ravee will then turn to north west pas by kailapore sealkote cross chenab jhelum river then ride north forty mile where will strike hill reach lord district extends thirty mile way among hill be route by hope to travel if hear of danger by way will of course strike off to right left a may be most convenient journey be from thirty to forty mile day horse must of course go much farther must regulate speed by of baggage animal will be fully week upon road coming down did in five day in order to be in time for arrival eight trunk be not filled with thing percy said with laugh must not think travel about with luggage four of be mine other four be filled with thing uncle wrote to agent at home to get for send out with have idea what be in baggage be nothing if be travelling in peaceful time sikh said at present lighter one go le likelihood of being meddled with a be will not know box when come up with baggage animal evening must never have done to be travelling through punjaub at present with box of english make must be looted by first party of soldier who came across have measured evening came to tent carpenter be at work night to make box must contain then box must be sewn up in matting before animal started morning marked with native mark to address of merchant in jummoo road for first four day be same a if be going there thus if matting be cut native box will be seen inside four men with be dismounted horse led by who came on here ahead of jummoo be safest place that must choose to address package to for ghoolab singh be one of most powerful of chief most powerful perhaps be brother of dhyan singh who be runjeet singh chief counsellor uncle of heera singh who succeeded father after murder by ajeet singh be who be uncle principal enemy a be son who obtained appointment of governor of district baggage directed to merchant in jummoo be therefore le likely to be interfered with than if intended for town a complaint laid before ghoolab by influential merchant might cause inquiry to be made punishment to be dealt out to who have interfered with good in transit ghoolab name be still powerful even with soldier influence among leader be quite sufficient to obtain sort of redress for injury committed upon wealthy enough to pay for protection seems curious state of thing to anyone coming straight from england percy said where law protects everyone where richest most powerful dare not wrong poorest peasant be good sikh said thoughtfully twirling moustache in case how can rich obtain advantage from money how indeed can become rich by rent obtain from who cultivate estate from mine from money invested in public fund company what do find for retainer to do have retainer be armed retainer of course have servant who do service of house look after stable garden so on carry arm do of servant if be wronged by neighbour what do do then simply go to court of law for redress just a anyone else must do case be heard decision given by judge richest man have to obey just same a poorest sound very good sikh said thoughtfully seems to that country must be very bad one for fighting men who live by adventure who want to fight can enter army fight battle of country abroad while fond of adventure can go to sea can visit wild country can go out to colony where be hard rough life where active man can acquire wealth now sahib have better lie down get sleep till be time to be moving nand chund said rising men be asleep already be getting too hot even to talk chapter iii at castle for four day journey be pursued without incident have brought with sufficient store of provision for journey travelled by by path avoiding village a much a possible halting for five six hour in middle of day performing greater portion of distance after sunset just a have started for evening ride on fifth day two horseman overtook reined up a did so have missed path one said can tell how far be to place where can find shelter for night ten mile farther will find yourselves in main road mile from sealkote if be bound thither will be glad to ride with for protection one said there be many party of budmashes about will hardly interfere with so strong respectable company travel slowly nand chund said will not reach sealkote to night when beast be tired will halt be in hurry care whether reach town to night to morrow morning therefore if have objection will share bivouac far better to lose few hour than to run risk of having throat cut a will nand chund said be very welcome to stay with if so plea a rode stranger chatted with nand chund percy reining back horse riding among men after travelling about five mile nand chund ordered halt baggage animal be unloaded tent pitched two of men began to prepare meal while others looked to horse two stranger also dismounted spoke for time together then one said to sikh officer will think that know own mind have concluded that a moon be bright horse fairly fresh will push on to sealkote be for to decide nand chund said be welcome to stay with free to ride on if prefer after few inquiry about way two men mounted rode on a soon a sound of horse hoof became faint chund spoke to one of men who immediately left party glided away to right have sent to watch nand chund said to percy warrant will halt before be gone mile man will keep in field till get near will bring word if move on what do suspect to be have doubt be enemy may have be on track since started only for last day march be watching doubt what make think so nand chund many thing be unlikely that must be upon by path instead of on main road that must offer to stop with when be so well mounted be singular also change of intention when found that be going to halt conversation too be not that of honest men what did talk about said be coming from lahore talked of doings there be harm in percy asked in surprise only that be natural when falling in with party like ours that must have asked many question whence came whither be going what merchandise carried be trading on own account be carrying good for trader how be have strong armed party with be question honest men must ask spoke only of own doings asked word about ours have doubt that know who be who be that really wanted to learn be where intended to stop now be be certain watching probably one may have ridden off to carry news fetch band while other remains to see that move camp what be going to do nand chund will wait till ruzam return if must have ridden straight on will move at once if remain on watch seems that be likely to do so till morning will when ruzam return go off with four of men making circuit come down upon from behind despatch if one go other remains on watch ruzam can be trusted to give good account of before return here must be terrible to kill two men who have not actually harmed percy said shocked at first experience of custom of punjaub have not done much harm yet nand chund said grimly be endeavouring to draw into ambush will cost life liberty perhaps lord fortress life therefore will have more hesitation in killing than must in shooting lurking tiger three hour passed then ruzam glided into camp what be news ruzam have just left man said have be close to time listening to talk have be watching from spot mile away must have come up to hear what be saying must stay behind alone saying what be true enough that also might be watching if separated might be taken singly for same reason must stay while other rode forward must have shot one must not have be sure of killing second before rode off so thought better to be quiet at last concluded that have really encamped for night that must safely ride off with news be unfortunate that moonlight be so bright for prevented crawling up close enough to attack before must mount did hear what road be likely to be beset did not enter into particular said that must be sure to have a there must be party on road be young sahib be anxious to capture order be strict that be to be taken unharmed that rest of be to be killed taken prisoner will delay no longer nand chund said will leave tent standing put fresh wood on fire can be at sealkote in hour perhaps will return with party without delay load up horse let be off did hear say where have come from ruzam yes sahib there be six of at loodiana must have got news from someone in fortress of object of journey arrived there on day after did morning started one man be sent off with news while others followed not together singly so that road must take must be followed step traced night one man have be despatched with news of halting place see sahib nand chund said to percy be not wrong in saying that ride must be dangerous one truly so far enemy have be more than match for now must see if can not double upon a soon a baggage be packed party mounted to percy surprise officer led way back along road by have come be of use going forward said doubtless will take little time in getting member of band who be at sealkote together making start can calculate on at least hour for that only give three hour start will hope make sure that have continued journey will ride on fast so a to overtake before daylight will go back for mile then turn off across field by country track may hope before have travelled very far to hit upon leading in direction want to go will have moon for five six hour after will travel by torchlight have brought torch with one will be enough to show ditch nullah when be proceeding across country when be on road can do without two of men dismounted giving horse to comrade went on ahead searching for track across field after hour riding one be found be mere pathway used by peasant turning off on party followed in single file must not be better to leave baggage behind percy asked officer then must go on at gallop must be nuisance to lose thing must be of odds in comparison to life sahib colonel box may be of importance at rate have not come to yet if be attacked have to ride for of course must leave for may be in box colonel set life at much higher value hope now will outwit road be travelling will be known to be along will be gathering therefore may well give slip will cross chenab at daylight at gazerabad cross jhelum by boat few mile below jetalpore must be on watch for there then think will be safe till get near colonel fortress that of course will be most dangerous portion of journey since will know by road travel be for point be making will halt in grove will send two of men off on horseback by different road may calculate that one of at least will reach fortress colonel will then send out force sufficient to beat off attack likely to be made for a strength be known thirty forty men will have be considered ample for work seems very good plan percy agreed wonder that must dare to venture into uncle district where a say people be favourable to there be many valley nullah in must conceal besides much of country be uncultivated must lie hid for fortnight without much fear of being discovered if took provision with encamped near water night journey continued percy be so sleepy that several time dozed off in seat woke with start finding reeling in saddle at time however be obliged to pay attention to course for be often mere track even men walking ahead have difficulty in following there be deep nullah to be crossed once twice wide water course dry now covered with stone boulder be a nand chund told foaming torrent in wet season at such time quite impassable occasionally track turned off in direction quite different to that be following then directed course by star man going ahead with torch until came again upon cultivated ground struck upon path leading in right direction two river be crossed safely then rode north for two day percy felt thankful indeed when after pushing on last night nand chund upon arriving at clump of bush decided to halt just a daylight be beginning to break in east two best mounted men received instruction at once rode on at brisk pace while rest entered bush dismounted men with long knife clearing space sufficiently large for party fire be lit food cooked then four men be placed on watch at edge of thicket rest threw down to sleep seemed to percy that have hardly closed eye knew must have slept for hour from heat of sun blazing down upon when nand chund put hand on shoulder said be well sahib party of horse be approaching doubt not that colonel be with percy leapt to foot made way to edge of thicket be men nand chund said be riding in regular line minute two later added there be colonel at head officer with white horse hair crest to helmet unless so informed percy must have have idea that tall bearded man in silk attire be englishman until leapt from horse beside exclaiming heartily well percy boy be glad indeed to see safe sound have be in fidget about for last week for have have news that band of strange horseman have be seen on road there be report that of have entered district though where have gone none knew however be well that end well be delighted when two fellow rode into fortress morning within few minute of other with news that have got thus far be hiding here till came out to fetch may imagine be not long in getting into saddle well have be rough beginning lad trouble be at end now may be sure that there be foe near at hand who will venture to try conclusion with four hundred of best troop in punjaub hardly fancied that must have come percy know when have be so pleased a when received letter from mr fullarton at loodiana saying that have come out with must probably be there in few day be very glad to come uncle very did not take five minute to decide about coming after have read letter be something like what expected to be percy although not altogether fancied that must be more like what father be at age seems yesterday that be boy together though be so many year ago see likeness think be more like what be father dear good fellow a be always looked a if have stiff collar on even from boy be for method order doubt be right enough though hated well may a well mount can tell about voyage a ride back have done work well nand chund knew must safely trust boy in charge have be troubled by way only once have absolutely seen sahib officer gave colonel short account of incident of pretended traveller so be at loodiana day after arrived then someone must have sent off word of object of mission a soon a started must find out traitor nand chund make end of however will talk that over afterwards by time horse have be led out from thicket colonel watched percy critically a mounted nodded approvingly a sprang into saddle be right lad see that be at home on horse will make sikh of before long how have got on with nand chund must have be quite in fog percy a to what be going on tongue must have have quite holiday since left loodiana young sahib speaks punjaubi very fairly colonel have difficulty in understanding other speaks punjaubi colonel repeated must be dreaming nand chund how can boy have learned language suppose mean hindustani though how must have picked that up in english school be more than can understand there be such thing heard of when be boy be punjaubi speaks colonel though told must also make understood in officer said in native language nand chund tell that can speak punjaubi percy in truth can hardly believe speak very well yet uncle can get on with worked five six hour day on voyage out with punjaubi servant of mr fullarton thought must be of great use for to know something of language when arrived a to hindustani have have master at school twice week for more than year before sailed be delighted percy must have worked hard indeed to speak a fluently a do doe tremendous credit own must never have thought of spending time on board ship learning language do take after father more than after be just sort of thing must have done well be pleased boy very pleased mr fullarton spoke in very favourable term about when wrote wondered then how must know anything about boy of age who chanced to be fellow passenger thought be merely bit of civility on part meant nothing suppose heard from servant that be working up language with so came to take interest in perhaps sat near at table uncle took meal with second third officer midshipman captain offered to put there be so much nicer than going among lot of grown up people of course gave great deal more time for work towards end of voyage came to know most of passenger mr fullarton be first to be kind to used very often to come forward to where be working with ram singh be name of servant must explain thing about grammar must not understand ram singh must not tell for of course did know anything about grammar well can ride can talk punjaubi fairly know something of hindustani be capital beginning percy have other accomplishment nothing that know of percy laughed except on way out practised pistol shooting before got to calcutta there be not many on board who shot much better mr fullarton made practise from first told that to shoot straight be one of most valuable accomplishment must have in india be perfectly right colonel said heartily quick eye hand with pistol be invaluable especially in country like where assassination be most ordinary way of getting rid of enemy pistol have saved life several time fact that be dead shot have doubt saved from many other such attempt even most desperate men hesitate at undertaking job involves certain death for even if planted dagger between shoulder before have time to lay hand on butt of pistol must be lulled to certainty by men must keep that up lad till can hit egg swinging at end of string nine time out of ten at twelve pace be very seldom that want to use pistol at longer range than now be at like what expected to be think have formed distinct idea about uncle father said be taller than be bigger of course expected to be very sunburnt brown that perhaps must have beard a most of sikh have beard thought too that perhaps must dress to extent like native did not expect to see altogether like sikh adopted native costume to great extent colonel said of course there be always prejudice against anything like european dress must have constantly kept before mind of men that be foreigner dress too be lighter more easy than own in climate like think anyone must deny for moment that be good deal more picturesque colonel be indeed in complete garb of sikh warrior of rank on head wore close fitting steel cap beautifully inlaid with gold slender shaft rose three inch above top in be inserted plume of white horsehair fell down over helmet from lower edge of steel cap fell curtain of light steel link covering forehead down to eyebrow then falling so a to shield cheek neck behind in front be steel bar inlaid like helmet be now pushed up when required must be lowered down over nose almost to chin so a to afford protection against sword stroke from side robe of thickly quilted silk fell from neck to knee round body be four piece of armour of work similar to helmet one of formed back other front piece two smaller plate cut out under arm connected together across back be slung shield of about eighteen inch in diameter also of steel inlaid with gold in action be held in left hand not upon arm like in use in europe in middle age arm be protected by steel piece from elbow to wrist hand being covered by fine strong link mail kept in place by strap across palm of hand leg be covered by long tightly fitting white trouser reaching to foot sash of purple with gold embroidery bristled with pistol dagger armour although strong capable of resisting sword cut spear thrust be very light steel being of finest temper quality costume be exceedingly picturesque one showed off colonel powerful figure to advantage officer be very similarly attired soldier be for most part dressed in chain armour with shield larger than of officer of leather with metal boss wore turban others steel cap what do think of men percy colonel asked a reined in horse watched horseman trot past four abreast be fine looking men percy said doubtfully must look great deal better if be dressed alike ah be european notion percy doubt to english eye accustomed to cavalry do look rather scratch lot dress make difference when come to fighting from first maharajah european officer have to abandon idea of introducing anything like uniformity in dress men clothe in addition to expense must be to to get new clothes on joining feeling of independence must revolt against dictation on subject have all along be very difficult to get to submit to anything like european discipline to attempt to introduce uniformity of garb must produce revolution among there be such thing a uniformity even in attire of most highly favoured troop of native prince appearance of escort retinue be varied in extreme richly dressed noble ride side by side with men whose armour trapping have come down to from many generation carry lance matchlock only sword be pretty nearly naked to waist others be swathed up to eye in gaudy coloured robe so that man arm be serviceable be willing to learn drill be obedient to discipline of good behaviour care nothing for clothes though a far a can discourage from dressing more showily than rest of course insist that be fairly dressed in accordance with notion must remember that until day of marlborough there be nothing like uniform in european army especially among cavalry even in time there be very considerable latitude in matter of dress suppose will have to dress in sikh fashion uncle will be certainly better lad indoors dress be easy flowing will find comfortable european dress will at once mark out must there be trouble chance of escape must be vastly greater in sikh costume than in anything must at once point out a european in course of year will speak language like native for a may suppose will hear nothing else except when be alone together indeed to punjaubi now come much more naturally than english if be not have always made point of getting box of european book sent up from calcutta whenever opportunity offer must almost have forgotten native tongue there be fortress look fairly strong doe not have just ascended brow a did so stronghold came suddenly into view stood on rocky spur running out from hill behind broke suddenly away at foot of wall seemed to percy to be almost perpendicular on three side look tremendously strong uncle surely nobody must scale rock except by treachery be impregnable on side see at rate on two of on side facing be very steep indeed almost inaccessible there be footpath cut for most part in rock zigzag up face there be small gateway though ca see from here by fortress be entered from side there be three place can only be climbed by ladder when be removed nothing unless provided with wing must get up weakest side be of course that see where spur run up to hill behind have taken pain to strengthen there have blasted cut thirty foot deep a many wide at foot of wall across shoulder have indeed very largely added to strength of whole place since be first appointed governor ten year ago at time only resided here occasionally sometimes moving about in town village at others absent often for month with three regiment on military expedition foresaw that there must be trouble at runjeet singh death quietly steadily prepared for knew weak point of place for when be first appointed predecessor a be often case declined to hand over fortress to have to capture be easy matter then managed one night with hundred picked men to scale rock unnoticed when storm be raging then threw up rope with grapnel to top of wall drew up rope ladder so got footing crept along wall with scarcely opposition for sentry be cowering under shelter of parapet reached gate before garrison have taken alarm rest be easy threw open gate fired couple of gun a signal main body of troop who have moved unperceived to point quarter of mile away hurried up be speedily master of place at once resolved must do best to avoid being turned out in so summary manner so far have succeeded there have be two three attempt to take place none of be serious for take care that sentry sleep at post must need regular siege by large force to take mean of course by sikh british have proved over over again that rock fortress considered impregnable can be taken without serious difficulty by determined men how large be uncle be about quarter of mile from end to end at widest point be about two hundred fifty yard from wall to wall so there be plenty of room not only for troop for large number of fugitive from country round have grain stored away sufficient for year even if strength of garrison be doubled water be of course principal difficulty there be large tank when took possession have greatly added to of course water fall on roof in rainy season be carefully collected stored in addition have constructed trough to streamlet six mile away in hill brings down sufficient water for daily need without touching supply in tank be stringently preserved in case of siege for of course enemy must a first step intercept supply from hill supply in tank be certainly ample for many month must of course be replenished in wet season so have anxiety on head always keep considerable amount of salt in magazine on approach of enemy cattle must be driven in slaughtered salted in fact meat be matter of minor necessity here for although sikh have objection to eat can do very well without be perfectly content if can get plenty of native grain proportion of rice road wound up valley under foot of rock on fortress stood then climbed hill by zigzag cut at easy gradient until reached level of shoulder followed down to castle quarter of mile away wall on side be much higher than on other face gate be flanked by two massive stone tower two others rose at angle drawbridge be lowered a approached over crossed deep fosse have be cut by colonel ten cannon be placed on wall four on of tower must be hard nut to crack percy uncle said a rode into gateway must indeed uncle wonder have be left here unmolested passing through gateway be faced by wall extended in semicircle in front of four cannon frowned down on gateway from embrasure parapet be very high be closely loopholed for musketry turning to right rode between end of wall main one then turning sharply to left rode into town percy have expected to find only

everything be scrupulously clean tidy woman be drawing water from conduit child played about unconcernedly everything looked so quiet peaceful that percy wondered vaguely whether inhabitant shared to extent in doubt that uncle have expressed to of ability to hold place against force a might possibly be brought against chapter iv raid from hill a party rode through street people looked up in surprise at young european riding by side of governor be evident that though secret of coming have reached ear of enemy have be well preserved in town on alighting at entrance to governor house

tribe along whole range of mountain on northern side of indus be year since have trouble with of for on last occasion punished so heavily have be quiet ever since doubt report have reached of state of confusion in punjaub think to take advantage of however will find out mistake be just a much bound to protect district a if be still dutiful servant of lahore a indeed be save in matter of resigning governorship for only ten day since sent off annual amount at district be taxed when took charge of sum be not large one for at time be must say poorest district in punjaub though now thanks to fact that life property be secure here population have increased fourfold revenue tenfold still have doubt amount send be very useful at lahore where treasury be said to be empty enables agent there to

dust servant now announced that three officer be in attendance be at once shown in colonel informed of news have received robber must be punished punished heavily went on for if be permitted to plunder people without retaliation must have dozen of hill clan following example question be what force can send without unduly weakening garrison here cavalry must be of little use will take fifty trooper may find level bit of country where can be made useful of course will take four mountain gun ten camel gun st company of artillery to whom belong chief dependence must be on infantry must say must spare four hundred very well that will leave ample force against sudden attack on place a to serious expedition must certainly have warning from lahore in time to return before must arrive here will accompany expedition sohan verdi will take command of fort in absence know that need not tell to be vigilant nand chund will go with in command of troop of cavalry lal boghra of infantry take

certainly percy will be good introduction for to mountain warfare thank uncle will be splendid change will enjoy immensely can turgar fellow fight can fight in way well enough be good against disciplined troop what be way uncle village be fortified for when be not engaged in plundering village of plain be constantly having petty war with other otherwise only idea of fighting be to make sudden rush down upon column convoy struggling along defile up breakneck path rush be formidable enough against unsteady troop disciplined men who keep head show bold front can beat off again easily enough need not say that one have to be careful on expedition for man who straggled away from main body under belief that there be enemy near must be cut off to certainty so will be pleased to remember that happens be to keep near now will go give order about bullock cart provision there be time to be lost have better go in see mahtab tell have happened ask to get something to eat before start to see that provision for private consumption be put into cart percy be rather nervous at mission a be afraid that aunt must be alarmed at thought of colonel going into danger however took news very coolly have many such expedition when first came here said of course there be danger be very slight colonel have so often be in great danger have come out unharmed have ceased to worry about small thing cannon generally do work tribesman run before infantry can attack real danger be from surprise uncle have have far too much experience to be caught unawares must be careful percy not to wander away to get excited dash on ahead must keep near to so have ordered aunt will be very careful hope will said seriously there be glory to be gained in hill fight foolhardiness may very well cost anyone life tribesman have plenty of courage be quite reckless of life if can cut down enemy be a patient watchful a wild beast in pursuit of prey preparation be soon made troop who be to take part in expedition fell in at appointed time colonel after making careful inspection of placed at head led way through gate percy rode beside immediately behind came troop of cavalry artillery followed little gun be carried on back of camel four mountain gun drawn by a many animal infantry followed battery twelve bullock cart bringing up rear be going to send horse straight on percy be pretty certain hillmen will have recrossed river be up in village before tactic be always to strike blow collect plunder be off again to hill long before force can be collected to oppose still cavalry will give peasant confidence will return to home when hear that force however small have arrived for protection will be there by midnight will be able to gather news from peasantry a to village robber came from inquire about road guide so that when get there to morrow night time need be lost about matter be important thing with hill tribesman to strike back a quickly a possible found when first came here that nothing impressed so much a promptitude with be chased punished be so different to dawdling way in native operation be conducted that took completely by surprise know old saying who give quickly give twice be just a true of blow a be of money journey be accomplished that day night be cold enough to render blazing fire most enjoyable percy when lay down felt comfort of long sikh coat made of sheep skin with wool inside outside decorated with pattern worked in coloured thread following evening reached jaegwar colonel took up quarter in principal house in village to of inhabitant be now returning nand chund made report a be eating supper there be about five hundred of came down colonel in seven different party a far a can make out about three hundred of be turgars others be naga

a to road nand chund track for say be nothing more up to turgar village cross river about two mile north of place there be five village lying within circle of about three mile nearest of be six mile beyond river fighting force be put a from twelve to fifteen hundred of course if two other tribe aid must more than double that there be steep place on road one very deep narrow valley quite ravine must say to be passed through if get to know of coming be doubt place where will fight if get through there before can gather to oppose will of course make stand at village be high up on hill men have made two march of twenty mile colonel said must be a well that must have day rest before advance for will be heavy day work besides must rather that turgars must hold ravine other strong point may have be to march through before be ready to oppose must say afterwards that must never have got through have known be coming if show that can no longer rely upon being able to arrest advance of column may be long time before venture upon raid like however strong place be may be sure will be able to turn out of that rocket tube will astonish besides however strong valley be ought to be able to outflank advantage of fight there be that if turn out with good deal of loss will carry village more easily for will shake courage if find be unable to hold place have relied on a main defence of village accordingly force rested next day on morning following started before be light reached ford across river just a day be breaking have doubt be prepared for colonel said a watched troop gun making passage must hardly have expected that force must make appearance here so soon be sure to have placed scout on hill to give warning be wild looking country percy said a increasing light enabled to see hill rising behind hill yes battery two of horse artillery knowing country well taking post on hill must make very hot for fortunately there be fear of anything of sort wall piece be have besides musket matchlock road seems to go straight up hill over crest went on after examining ground with field glass ah can make out group of three four men just to left of bush there do see smoke have just lighted fire be signal have doubt a see smoke be getting thicker thicker three four minute later two other column of smoke be seen rising one two three mile to right other a much to left take dozen of trooper nand chund skirmish up hill company of infantry will follow if find only handful of men there drive off if be in force get near enough to draw fire find out strength then fall back again upon supporting company will not be far behind be hardly likely that will be pressed will not be able to gather to offer serious opposition until get mile further little party of cavalry rode on company of infantry following close behind colonel grove waited until saw rest of force cross ford then set forward again have handed glass to percy who sat watching advanced party a ascended hill horseman have scattered along hillside be several hundred yard ahead of infantry be firing uncle exclaimed presently see smoke heard sound of shot there saw puff of smoke just now how many gun did hear percy five six must say be about there be saw three standing up there may have be two three more engaged in making fire be hardly likely that must have more than five six men on watch even if knew yesterday that have come to village must hardly keep more than lookout here be evidently case a horseman be seen to pas over crest one of soon reappeared galloped down hill nand chund report colonel said when arrived at head of column there be four men fired few shot at when reached top of hill be half way down other side there be good deal of bush wood down there nand chund say that will not advance further till company in support join a there might be force hidden there quite right tell at rate be not to mount next hill until come up when force arrived at crest saw nand chund footman drawn up beyond bush in hollow be good deal steeper beyond uncle yes great deal steeper there will be little difficulty in getting gun up if mistake not there be body of men on opposite crest trooper be sent on to nand chund telling to advance farther until whole force came up when force be united colonel said hill be too steep for to act with effect nand chund ride along valley with troop for mile so climb hillside then come back along crest till within quarter of mile of a soon a see begin to fall back before advance charge take in flank if be not too strong chase down other side pursue too far cavalry at once rode off two company of infantry be then thrown forward in skirmishing order rest of force followed two three hundred yard behind when skirmisher be half way up hill enemy opened fire order have be given to to pay attention to to keep musket slung behind to press forward when arrived within hundred yard of enemy be to lie down return fire until column came up order be carried out just a colonel reached line saw nand chund horseman coming along top at full speed forward men at double shouted troop leaping to foot climbed rapidly up hill be over before reached top hillmen have not awaited arrival of cavalry have fled down hill behind sowars pursuing cutting down several before reached very broken ground at foot from opened sharp fire cavalry at once retired up hill again track now instead of ascending next rise followed valley down see colonel said when reached crest valley make sharp bend mile down doubt that defile lie up there can see that next hill be very much more lofty rugged looking well nand chund what force be there somewhere about hundred colonel must not have charged saw be beginning to make off be gathering like snowball colonel remarked expect that when reach defile will find whole force there for two mile followed valley grew narrower a advanced side being more more precipitous party of men have be seen moving about higher up presently scattering fire be opened colonel ordered two party hundred strong to make way up hill on side then to advance along keeping abreast of column if opposition be serious said will aid with gun in short time hillside be dotted with puff of smoke little must be seen of enemy who lay behind rock occasionally running back then dropping again behind fresh shelter a troop advanced fire on side momentarily became hotter four mountain gun now opened fire throwing shell high up on hillside native must be seen bolting from shelter two flanking company have be almost brought to standstill resumed advance valley narrowed more more until be ten twelve yard wide at bottom side be covered with great boulder jagged rock with bush growing up between from fierce fire be opened four mountain gun have be left behind at spot where must still assist flanking company camel gun guarded by cavalry advanced along bottom keeping up rapid fire against invisible foe infantry be directed to clear rock on side fire be very brisk report being echoed re echoed from hill sound seemed continuous be evident that enemy be far superior in number progress be very slow until two flanking company appeared high up on hill advancing along opened fire on enemy below who although hidden from in front of must be seen from above effect be immediate fire slackened force pushed forward a rapidly a nature of ground must permit in quarter of hour issued out at other end of ravine number of men must be seen ascending hill in front of on a colonel have learnt before starting first of village be situated there be halt until troop be again assembled mountain gun came up advance be then renewed chapter v retribution upon resuming march colonel divided infantry into three body of equal strength first be accompanied by gun be to move by path straight up hill others between whom cavalry force be divided be to ascend few hundred yard to right left of central column so a to flank village on side for time enemy kept up fire from brow of hill died away a troop pressing rapidly forward neared in short time top of hill be gained village stood quarter of mile away be surrounded by high wall above must be seen tower of chief fortalice little four pounder will not be of much good in breaching that colonel said must attack by gate batter down percy do ride round to column on left see if there be gate on side do nand chund do same on right if there be gate there will send of camel gun to try beat down if ca do gate must be blown in there be men with powder bag in column let cavalry work round behind village see what ground be like there looked to a if broke away on side if there be gate in side wall let right column move round to assist cavalry to cut off enemy retreat let infantry of left column join here for attack on gate fellow be evidently in strong force indeed wall be fringed with smoke bullet be pattering round thick fast men however have at once be placed in shelter behind stone wall remained inactive for hour when percy nand chund rode back within minute two of other report be similar there be gate in side wall while behind wall on other side there be deep precipitous ravine with few foot between upper edge wall colonel gave order that fifty of infantry must remain on side to fire down into ravine a enemy retired across rest must join cavalry be to take post just out of fire on flank to cut off fugitive who might drop from wall endeavour to escape from top of hill time have not be lost for four mountain gun have kept up steady fire at gate in front be when two body of infantry came up already torn splintered one of being evidently thrown off hinge then two of company advanced through inclosure in skirmishing order when within fifty yard of wall opened fire at defender aided by whole of gun after waiting for five minute to allow fire to have effect colonel gave word column ran forward towards gate heavy fire be opened through broken plank wait to return colonel who be riding at head of column shouted throw yourselves against gate weight will burst down with cheer men rushed on a reached gate there be crash shattered gate fell poured into village resistance be slight for a soon a column began to advance fire from wall have suddenly ceased ten twelve men be shot bayoneted at gate a troop spread through village met with more antagonist door of house stood open hearth be cold woman child have evidently be sent away early in morning a soon a entered gate saw that resistance be over colonel shouted to men behind to follow rode straight through

a men behind came up led through gate bade spread along edge of ravine to open fire on tribesman party of whom be already beginning to mount opposite side of ravine fire be maintained with considerable effect until be out of range then various detachment be called in by sound of bugle troop ordered to cook meal while be being done thorough search be made through village in chief tower

to accede to most of have left country at once knowing that murder must speedily follow dismissal colonel grove having since death of runjeet successfully defeated attempt to turn out of governorship fortress have determined to await end being sure that ere long hatred of sikh against british must bring about war might entirely change position be few month after percy arrival that ghoolab refused to accept post of vizier be good news uncle be not asked when messenger arrived bearing letter containing news from member of court at lahore who be in colonel pay interest know percy rather think must have be better if have accepted post in first place must have have hand so full that must not have have time to give much attention to affair then if have sent strong body of troop to attack place a likely a not must have said that be being sacrificed in interest must have be occasion for fresh mutiny lastly viziership have of late be fatal to holder ghoolab might have formed exception might have be freed from most dangerous enemy now will be able to carry on intrigue from jummoo without interruption since death of runjeet hand have be tied to certain extent first by brother dhyan then by heera being prime minister have to take care that movement of endangered popularity position now that two brother nephew have gone need consult only what think be own interest be distinctly interest that son must be governor of district be flourishing capable of being squeezed to large extent lie so close to own territory be only on account of that be enemy uncle matter be of much longer standing began at one of battle against afghan sirdar troop commanded by ghoolab did very badly have not be for courage obstinacy of three regiment of portalis must have be defeated runjeet always managed to keep thoroughly well acquainted with what be going on ghoolab be for time in considerable disgrace while very handsome present be made to portalis three month pay given to of officer soldier warned portalis that ghoolab must not forgive be little headstrong scoffed at danger three month after fell by knife of assassin be good comrade friend of mine be indeed only man among european officer really cared for did not hesitate to denounce ghoolab to runjeet in open durbar a author of assassination of course must not prove maharajah be certainly of opinion ghoolab be ordered to go live on estate be for month in great disgrace acquaintance warned that be throwing away life by thus venturing to denounce one of powerful trio of brother a see have lived through thus far still have only be by most unceasing caution wariness have have at least dozen narrow escape from assassination during lifetime of runjeet singh intrigue against be incessant old lion knew when be well served stuck to staunchly be in last year of life compelled by pressure brought upon to sign dismissal sent private note by hand of trusty messenger contained only few word be obliged to yield there be reason why must do so sword must always protect head be aware of what be going on at court have already resolved to hold governorship till last be very glad to get old man note have be kind good master to must not have liked to take action might appear rebellion against what others said thought did not care now have old lion approval conscience be perfectly easy ghoolab commanded force came to put son in possession fact that have to retire after losing hundred of men without accomplishing object did not a may suppose in way diminish feeling of unfriendliness towards get constant accurate intelligence of what take place at jummoo know be constantly in thought denunciation of form one of staple subject of conversation among intimate need hardly tell how great be terror among inhabitant of district at thought of falling into ghoolab hand cruelty displayed in conquest of cashmere be appalling thousand of people being put to death by form of torture trade of district must be destroyed merchant plundered under one excuse other private property must be confiscated by therefore be well served trader have naturally agent correspondent over punjaub who inform of rumour current account be promptly transmitted to so get earliest possible intelligence of movement intrigue a soon a be set on foot body of men can be set in motion within couple of hundred mile of fortress without receiving news of in course of day two few day later colonel said when met at breakfast there be trouble coming percy have have letter from agent at lahore saying that several of punch a leader of soldier be called have for last day two be loudly denouncing saying that be disgrace to sikh nation that insolent foreigner must not only remain among in teeth of dismissal by ruler of lahore maintain by force of arm a governor of district of punjaub a ranee have vizier be entirely helpless in hand of soldier there can be doubt that will authorize expedition against will indeed be glad to agree to project will remove number of insolent soldiery from city clamour for war against british grows daily in strength most of leading sirdar be in matter in agreement with troop ranee can not think that be very much better that must occupy in expedition against man in whom have of course interest than embark in great war may end by costing infant son kingdom what be going to do uncle colonel shrugged shoulder sharpen sword see that gun be in good order overhaul stock of ammunition feel quite convinced that can repel attack by mutinous horde like provided only that there be treachery at work be one weak point have never found out yet uncle who be sent ghoolab news of coming here have ground for suspicion against anyone nand chund two three of officer of whose fidelity feel absolutely sure have be quietly trying to find out ever since came here without success azim bund steward have also be trying in other quarter too have altogether failed of course traitor may be member of household not one of officer in case treachery must be of little importance although by getting news of coming might have struck heavy blow in other respect can tell nothing beyond fact that be alive well very much on guard may give number of cannon have got amount of ammunition in stock state of food magazine news can give satisfaction can do harm be altogether different if be officer in considerable body of men there be certain number who think have grievance of kind have be punished unjustly think have be overlooked in promotion that service have not be sufficiently recognized in be merely desire for change of sort when men know a of course do know that soldier of army be enriching at expense of government of population may feel dissatisfied with dull life regular pay here at rate there must be many who must be worked up by astute rascal gate thrown open rope ladder lowered over wall might lay place at mercy of enemy have fear whatever of section being numerous enough to get up anything like formidable mutiny party of only twenty determined men might night break way in here cut throat long before troop must come to assistance might seize wife jewel valuable make escape by mean of rope ladder over wall that think be most dangerous contingency always sleep with three brace of pistol within reach of hand know have warned to keep arm by bedside still though might sell life dearly may be sure that attack must not be made except by force sufficient for purpose why keep strong guard in house uncle because boy know who traitor be officer in command might be very man might so contrive that guard be composed of men whom have corrupted where must be then might appoint nand chund to be always officer of guard constable of palace eh percy well might call what like uncle surely must be able to pick out dozen men of whose fidelity be assured duty must not be severe must only have to furnish two sentry at door instead of being sent from one other of regiment will think of percy just at present there be le ground for fear than usual for if expedition be on foot to attack openly plot a must most certainly be delayed until there be force outside where conspirator must betake after carrying design into execution fact that even be successful must certainly be pursued for most part hunted down slaughtered by cavalry have doubt be one of reason why such attempt a be talking of have be made long ago well do hope that when army approach do what percy suggests mahtab who have be listening silently to conversation said to husband have escaped so many time roland that have come to think that attempt against life will ever succeed certainly be likely that ghoolab while organizing open assault upon will take measure to secure aim being carried out in other way if possible very well wife may consider settled that on day when attacking force cross boundary of province nand chund will be installed a chief of special bodyguard here chapter vi siege not day passed now without messenger coming in with warning of approaching danger one morning early officer on guard reported that large number of person must be seen approaching by road from south do look like troop colonel asked sahib be on horseback on foot there be many cart among have doubt then kur aloof that be merchant of town coming in here for refuge enemy can not be far off know how soldier must squeeze if have chance will let people in here uncle will eat up provision drink up water a told percy have sufficient of for number double that at present within wall did four time total now here arrive supply must still hold out six month two month be utmost that siege be likely to last one need never be afraid of long siege by men commanded by leader having authority over powerful prince might send troop on siege order to maintain until captured place even if took ten year to do so at present punjaub be without master troop have only be induced to come here by prospect of plunder a soon a find that make little impression upon that siege with labour hardship danger may continue for many month will soon get tired of in absence of controlling power will march away have good many deserter from service among little a love european will utilize service anticipate that for while at least will be made very hot for there be score of point on hillside mile away where gun can be posted to play on while must make feeble return there be nothing like plunging fire kept up night day to weaken spirit lower confidence of garrison will be time when traitor if there be will be busy among men will need unceasing care vigilance to prevent trouble in short time people seen in valley below began to enter fortress be a colonel have anticipated merchant other people having something to lose from various town in district most of brought with cart laden with choicest merchandise have portable valuable money with reported that news have come in evening before very large force have arrived at point within fifteen mile of frontier of province that soldier have be promised sack of town village a inducement for to undertake siege of fortress how be to feed so many mouth colonel asked one of leading merchant with smile know that lord have great store laid up in magazine merchant answered be of course ready to pay for that will let have have doubt that magazine will hold out a long a be necessary colonel replied a regard who enter here a guest man woman child will draw ration of what food have a long a last have be bought out of revenue of province a of contributed so will now share know will fare worse if place be taken be found here than must have done have remained quietly at home merchant shook head there must be worse sahib soldier plunder kill burn destroy a did in cashmere can do more if find here be not afraid of taking fortress be strong everyone know lord valour experience army will never be able to win way in here hope not friend will certainly do best to prevent from doing so now about yourselves stream of fugitive grows broader thicker hour if go on like by nightfall will have over five thousand person here in addition to strength of garrison against say nothing thousand at least will be able bodied men capable of bearing arm will expect to do best where be to stow so great number barrack be already full few indeed will be able to find lodging in house of trader have tent straw for two thousand people how can be pitched ground be solid rock there be way of driving tent peg see not how can be erected might spread over cart so obtain protection from night air shelter for woman child might even erect pole in cart stay by rope to side be very good idea will order officer in charge of store to issue tent to owner of cart others must manage a best can daresay five hundred can be stowed away in loft of stable in other place not in use while with pole leaned against wall canvas spread over can make shelter good enough on pinch ox must be given over to one of officer who will see that be fed from granary will kill for food colonel have not over estimated number of likely to arrive before nightfall over five thousand have entered fortress stringent order be laid down none save regular troop must be allowed to approach wall party a arrived be conducted to spot allotted to open space be covered with shelter of one kind larger constructed of tent smaller of shawl blanket principal street be left clear of such erection in order to admit of free passage for troop be ordered that cooking operation must be performed there a fire must be dangerous in extreme among crowded tent when night came strong guard be placed on wall especially on facing shoulder of hill upon open attack must fall percy idea be carried out body guard composed of six men from of two infantry regiment equal number from cavalry marched into governor house under command of nand chund instruction be that one be to be allowed to enter house whatever might allege to be nature of business unless furnished with written order to do so from governor percy have be busy day seeing that new comer fell into place in aiding to shake down in sort of comfort be thoroughly tired out when joined colonel wife in room that evening well uncle be glad be coming at last be much better to know worst than to go on wondering when be going to begin know percy have be in so many trouble fray battle since came out here that thought that might have to stand siege be very great trouble to besides there be always possibility that something might occur to postpone altogether soldier most of sirdar seem bent upon having fight with english greatly hoped that must begin before ghoolab intrigue against have come to head however now have come must make best of have great fear of result while have be busy with people afternoon have be superintending mounting of two heavy howitzer a mortar if erect battery on hill a expect will will see if can not drop few shell among nothing unsteadies artillery men more than finding that earthwork in front of a expect protect that by ingenuity can defend from missile seem to drop down from sky upon how do do uncle simply by amount of powder put in mortar be always fixed at certain angle of course fix howitzer same way when use for purpose with mortar amount of powder of given strength required to send shell to given distance be known to artillery man with howitzer one must get by experiment first put in amount of powder think sufficient ball be fired up into air watch where drop if be short add ounce two of powder a case may be if be too far decrease charge until find that shell drop just behind enemy earthwork among artilleryman serving gun having once got exact charge of course stick to sort of thing annoys sikh who be not much accustomed to shell few of be sent up to lahore managed to get hold of one have several hundred cast here to fit two howitzer have large number of fuse made stored away for future use if try to climb rock few shell rolled down from wall be likely to be very effective what be to be duty principally uncle chief duty will be to watch percy especially at night officer will of course go round frequently a there may be traitor among can place absolute reliance on vigilance will be about a much a possible a will have to look after everything in daytime must take rest at night one can not do two three month without sleep will release from duty during day although in case of serious attack will take place on wall otherwise wish to sleep in day to keep sharp look out on everything at night being constantly upon wall seeing that sentry be vigilant listening intently for anything might indicate movement from below will tell off four of nand chund party to accompany for if treachery be intended there must be hesitation in planting dagger in heart then getting rid of body over wall be nearly sixteen now strong active on dark night must avail nothing against lurking assassin will begin to night uncle there be occasion for that enemy have not arrived yet indeed one must dream of attempting to ascend craig unaided fancy will try open assault to begin with when find fails may try surprise about midnight officer reported that dull confused sound must be heard down valley colonel took couple of signal rocket with one of box brought by percy from england be filled proceeded accompanied by nephew nand chund four of guard to wall at lower end of rock lantern placed on ground be burning here party of artillery men be standing by four gun looking down valley how far do think be away colonel asked officer in command there party of have just crossed wooden bridge over stream sahib heard trampling of horse upon distinctly be fourteen hundred thirteen yard from foot of rock drive wedge little farther be right cut nick upon other day when have got exact depression required to lay gun on bridge now let wait until body of be crossing three four minute later sound in distance became suddenly louder now nand chund fire rocket think have got about right angle rocket flew up in air burst distance away throwing out dozen fire ball light enabled governor to see right down valley slight alteration in direction of gun be made then one after be fired rocket be now thrown up by light dark mass of men on behind bridge must be seen to be broken up retreating almost at same moment four gun be fired from upper bastion be grape percy colonel said officer there be told to wait till men must see body of troop advancing up valley listen there go cavalry scampering back a hard a horse can lay foot to ground doubt whether will hear anything more of to night must hardly hope to have passed without noticing must have be sure that must have warning of coming doubt lad may not have calculated on opening fire upon in dark will not have reckoned upon rocket hoped have doubt to push part of force past place up on to brow before morning for must know well enough that must not pas under fire of gun when sun be once up how will get there uncle now have shown that be almost a dangerous by night a by day probably will march round among hill come down upon there will be difficulty in infantry doing may manage to drag few light gun with ca get anything like heavy artillery up there except by bringing along below taking up regular road be first of difficulty have to encounter a have large stock of blue light see how be going to get up hill be commanded by dozen of gun will be safe enough from fire a pas along under craig for there be not gun can be depressed sufficiently to bear upon there though can annoy by pitching shell hand grenade down upon still determined men might manage might even make way up hill in face of fire must never drag heavy gun up road can sweep with grape so see have got stiff problem to solve before can get battering gun to play on northern wall for hour kept watch there be still confused sound from lower end of valley nothing to indicate renewed advance therefore returned to house percy be aroused at daybreak at once made way to battery where have be night before colonel several of officer be already there lower end of valley be occupied by great mass of men horse waggon tent have be erected here there banner of occupant be flying before how strong do think be uncle percy asked be difficult to say mixed up a arm be in such confusion just a reached ground last night guess at about fifteen thousand have four battery of field gun there be away to right evidently came up together have kept something like order can make out several heavy gun mixed up with waggon whether there be ten twenty of must give opinion do see that large tent with red white flag be colour of ghoolab singh tent doubt be occupied by son gentleman who be named successor week after death of old lion have be waiting time be likely to wait longer be doubt nominal leader of expedition believe that have none of talent of father uncle matter will be directed really by chief of army have doubt council have be going on night a to what next move will be decision have probably arrived at be to wait until can get better idea of fortress surroundings considerable movement be now going on in enemy camp wind bore sound of trumpet to fortress be trying to get into something like order nand chund remarked waggon be drawing out of mass to take up position in rear assembly call of different regiment be sounding ah there be party going out to reconnoitre a spoke party of horseman rode out to left of camp several bright banner streamed in air escort of fifty cavalry followed mounted hill on opposite side of valley until reached spot two three hundred foot higher than summit of fortress just opposite to a soon a object have be made out colonel have sent word to gunner at battery along face ordering not to fire wish to make more bitter enemy said to officer in reply to look of surprise when issued order at present be only fighting against a instrument of ghoolab singh except on ground that be foreigner soldier have animosity against if be now to kill two three of favourite leader perhaps of sirdar who have be bribed into entering upon business must create active animosity against of course when fighting begin must take chance wish to slay anyone before single shot have be fired on side group of officer who be mile away remained for ten minute closely examining fortress then slowly returned to camp gun must carry easily enough into midst of camp sahib one of officer remarked know must wo begin for same reason must not fire at group of officer will let open ball hour later body of men estimated at five thousand marched away with two of battery of field gun soon be lost to sight a wound round hill skirting valley will see at daylight to morrow established on hillside above colonel said have thought several time of establishing fort near crest there must not be able to give much support by gun garrison must not make prolonged resistance when once found cut off altogether from with troop one must rely upon thoroughly such fort must immensely hinder operation indeed must hing until be captured be standard rule with out here percy said afterwards never to count upon native unless be with sikh be brave want good leader be not to be relied upon unless under eye of officer respect may hate a european in war of runjeet singh fought like lion under command will see that will be weak point if come to blow with british will fight fight pluckily without european to lead will fall into disorder there will be one to rally control to take advantage of temporary success to retrieve temporary failure know will speedily learn given english officer native of india fight a well a own men sepoy regiment in clive day ever since have shown worthy of fighting by side of white comrade must be worth very little if deprived of european officer thing against be slowness with work gun battery of british artillery must fire five shot while fire one infantry be proportionately slow in movement have tried tried in vain to get to work with smartness doe not seem however to be in night vigilant watch be kept along northern wall nothing be heard be not till hour after sunrise that column be seen coming along side of hill above gun be manned ready for action colonel delayed giving order until enemy reached sort of terrace on face of hill mile away three hundred foot higher than level of fortress now said will give hint to come further must not prevent establishing on terrace must learn that can come nearer two three shot will be sufficient hint gun opened fire enemy who be just commencing further descent retired hastily few minute later field gun opened fire be match however for much heavier piece on wall after hour exchange of shot drew back gun two of have be dismounted by well aimed shot from wall of party established well back on terrace where be out of sight of fortress main body ascended hill again encamped on crest occasionally gun be run forward discharged withdrawn to fire garrison made reply gun being very badly aimed of shot flying right over fortress while others struck ground outside wall now will have quiet for time sahib nand chund said to percy who be standing next to have done so much will want to settle what next movement be to be think will be turn to move next nand chund colonel who have overheard remark observed to night when get dark will sally out see if can not take gentleman with gun by surprise may be colonel that will expect sally will move whole force down again on to terrace after nightfall depends who leader be if be enterprising fellow be what must do do know uncle have be thinking that camp down in valley be smaller to day than be yesterday do think so percy will go to battery at other end have look at be possible that may have sent off party to join fellow up there if have done that intend to try effect of coup de main to attack in time before morning after close examination of enemy camp colonel officer be of opinion that although occupied a much space a before there be fewer men moving about than upon preceding day have sharp eye percy be well that noticed have not done so might have run head into trap instead of surprising be surprised ourselves that by greatly superior number will abandon idea now prepare to resist serious assault to night will have man capable of bearing arm in readiness will keep only few men on wall let rest lie down at once with order that be to sleep if can a there will be sleep for to night nand chund do post dozen of men at different point on wall let keep vigilant watch down upon town see that flag other signal be waved from roof window may well be that there have be arrangement made with traitor here to give notice by signal of intended sortie on part following uncle advice percy lay down for hour must not sleep being too excited at thought of conflict must probably take place during night when went in to dinner colonel be absent being engaged in mustering assigning to various post able bodied men among fugitive be posted round circuit of wall be with exception of northern face entrusted to charge be probable told that enemy will make diversion on side when attack on other will not however be serious for can hing unless with assistance of friend on wall among servant of trader be good many who have served in army be stationed at gun enjoined to open fire upon enemy camp if brought heavy artillery have there into play to battery section of wall number of blue light fire ball be served out one more of former be to be lighted few minute fire ball occasionally thrown into valley so that considerable body of enemy must escape observation trader be appointed a commander at various point of garrison thousand men be placed on north wall rest be stationed close at hand in readiness to support to move to point threatened percy ranee a be usually called in fortress said a sat waiting colonel return want to devote to protection of husband to night have fear of wall being carried by assault be too strong will be too well defended for do fear for life that have one more traitor here be sure occasion like with confusion excitement will afford just opportunity desire when be engaged in repulsing attack of enemy must be easy for assassin to use knife pistol without fear of action being noticed colonel will be thinking of nothing directing men repulsing attack therefore pray station near leave fighting to others keep eye closely upon about pistol in hand in readiness for action will do so aunt if there be anyone here who want to assassinate be just time must choose for attempt think must be a well to ask nand chund to pick out four of best men to hand over to order however sharply might look out in darkness confusion someone might spring suddenly forward upon uncle from side opposite that on be standing with five of on watch ought to be able to prevent anyone getting near will tell one purpose for require men will bid nand chund be equally silent there be saying who traitor may be perhaps someone have never thought of suspecting if knew be on watch might drop altogether only hope will try must be best thing must happen a must relieve from uncertainty have be feeling nand chund with rest of men will know be on duty here for heard uncle give order be that be to suffer nothing not even entry of enemy into town to induce to leave house a traitor must be very likely to take advantage of confusion to rush in perhaps to kill plunder fire place there will be one advantage of having men with uncle might send round with message to other part of wall must be obliged for time to be absent with round must leave for few minute without fear do if can help percy night will be dark if keep well behind may not notice for will have other thing to think about must send on message take if be of great importance if not send one of men in place rely upon more than on anyone else ah here be roland at last by ten o'clock everyone be at appointed post colonel took percy with on circuit round wall where exhorted everyone to be watchful vigilant to preserve absolute silence until must hear enemy in motion down valley have fear there whatever said a returned to northern wall even be there score of men among troop who have be bought over to play treacherous part must hing where there be so many around on watch treachery strike when least expected be powerless among multitude trader others from town know that life be at stake be just a well aware a be that place on side be impregnable unless assailant be aided from within can be trusted therefore to keep eye well open will not assign special duty percy have told ram bund commander that will keep near there be occasion for to stay close to if see point specially threatened can go there encourage men by voice presence have fear that will gain footing on wall will take post over gateway be where fancy brunt of attack will fall will either try to fill up cut there with faggot bundle of grass throw plank over then blow in gate at least be how must act under same circumstance a if make attack must have fellow of uncommon enterprise in command be likely will proceed in same course a for wall be fifty foot from parapet to bottom of cut there be native indian troop who must try to scale wall on ladder in face of strong determined garrison of course if must have brought heavy gun up here made breach in wall half filled up cut with ruin must have be different affair altogether though even then feel sure that must beat off a be can only reckon on finding quite unprepared for attack on carrying place by sudden rush believe that quarter of hour will see end of that a soon a understand be fully prepared will give up idea a hopeless now have nothing to do to wait expect attack about hour before daybreak be hour at will think be most likely to find sentinel drowsy chapter vii startling news hour passed slowly a garrison awaited attack of enemy men have be told that must lie down where stood leaving only officer sentry on watch top of wall yard behind be crowded with sleeping figure wrapt in mantle about two o'clock on be sensible of low confused sound in air be moving colonel said to percy who be sitting on parapet against be leaning be probable that have be ordered to leave shoe behind in case walk of sikh in soft leather shoe be almost noiseless besides be a yet long distance away be coming down hill continued quarter of hour later noise be certainly more distinct give credit for manner of approach must scarce notice noise if be not prepared for drowsy sentry must take for wind rising among hill one can hardly imagine ten thousand men be moving down towards two three of officer came up to report that be sure enemy be stirring colonel ordered to get men quietly under arm half hour passed be long time in coming uncle percy said in low voice be might have be here long before if did not want to give lesson must send up rocket in order to find out what be doing believe be only short distance away now will wait for to begin in short time be convinced that enemy be within hundred yard at most from wall quiet a movement be low hum a of order being given in suppressed tone must be heard on wall be in readiness at distance of few yard apart men stood with portfires in one hand match in other while between line of musket rested on parapet several time watcher thought must make out dim figure on opposite side of deep cut at foot of wall suddenly bright light burst out exactly opposite gate moment later twenty gun opened sending ball crashing through drawbridge gate at same instant rocket soared into air from over gateway moment later line of blue light flashed out along wall mass of men be rushing forward towards gate carrying great bundle on head while tremendous yell burst from thousand of throat be answered by one of defiance from wall illustration percy shoot assassin during attack on fortress assailant paused for moment in astonishment at line of light proof that garrison be prepared pause be momentary rushed forward again leader be few yard from edge of cut when colonel shouted fire flash of flame ran along wall twenty gun loaded to muzzle with grape poured content among enemy like field of wheat levelled by blast of tornado mob of men be swept to earth few remained erect throwing down bundle flying for life percy mindful of special work have moment light flashed out opposite gate summoned four men who be standing short distance away stood on watch near uncle for few minute there be duel between gun of fortress sikh cannon have be drawn down by hand wheel thickly wrapped with cotton cloth to prevent slightest sound being made infantry kept up storm of fire be replied to by volley of musketry from defender din be tremendous presently body of men carrying long beam plank again rushed forward many of reached edge of moat tried to push pole across destruction be so great from musketry fire from wall from six gun have be kept in reserve loaded with grape that survivor again fell back followed by exultant shout of garrison at moment that have advanced two port fire over gate went out simultaneously before others must be lighted percy saw figure have be crouching under parapet short distance off spring forward guard nearest to also observed movement threw in man way knife flashed in air fell assailant then sprung towards colonel whose back be turned to when ball from percy pistol struck in head fell dead in track pistol shot attracted attention amid roar of firearm percy without paying further attention to fallen man ordered remaining three guard to redouble vigilance scoundrel may not be alone said attempt may be repeated with retirement of second body of men charged to bridge fosse enemy lost heart be evident even to most determined that success be impossible now that garrison be prepared gun too suffered so terribly from heavier metal of on wall that half of lay dismounted gunner must no longer work others in face of heavy fire mowed down yell subsided fire ceased a noiselessly a have come assailant glided away into darkness pursued however for time by bullet shot of defender convinced that there be fear of repetition of assault colonel ordered greater part of troop back to quarter now that din near at hand have ceased rattle of musketry boom of gun must be heard from other wall colonel hurried away to see what be going on there found that moment firing began on north face of fortress broke out from valley on side where large number of men have stolen up in darkness while at same time heavy gun in camp have also opened fire defender have at once replied fire have be continued on side have begun to die away on side of assailant a soon a ceased on northern face colonel sent for party of artillery men to aid men working gun ordered steady fire to be kept up on camp then dismissed ally to tent returned to house to percy have gone a soon a fighting be over to tell aunt that attack have be repulsed that be well then fear be groundless percy aunt be mean of saving uncle life then related attempt at assassination result heaven be praised said bursting into tear have presentiment of evil a have more than once have before when life have be threatened thank god danger have come gone that be still unharmed did know who man be did not notice aunt think of looking at after have fallen there be such tremendous roar going on felt quite confused thought of nothing that attack might be repeated will go see who be a soon a be light by time hot coffee have be prepared percy have already partaken of when colonel returned a entered wife threw into arm thank god have returned safe roland have once more escaped danger threatened danger be not great time love being only from stray bullet for artillery confined fire to gate in hope doubt that lucky shot might bring drawbridge down not that be likely for have fastened up by dozen chain one of must have held be not bullet of enemy knife of assassin feared said pooh pooh love be always dreaming of assassin not without reason roland have not be for percy pistol must not be alive now colonel looked surprised at percy what doe mean lad did not hear fire indeed did not notice from time when attack began to time when be over do mean to say that life be attempted that saved be aunt doing not mine uncle percy then related injunction aunt have given result have saved life again mahtab said embracing wife tenderly at least time percy have done between who be traitor percy doe not know did not think of examining body then will do so at once colonel said

disgust be azim bund scoundrel be last man must have suspected be penniless when picked up year ago professed greatest attachment for being clever shrewd raised step by step until at last became confidential steward be bound to by tie of gratitude certainly thought absolutely devoted to interest ever since attempt to seize on way here showed that there be traitor in fortress have appeared most earnest in attempt to discover to think that time be scoundrel have never liked man though never suspected fidelity suppose have be heavily bribed have promise of good place from ghoolab singh well richly deserved fate have befallen be glad that be not soldier for like to think that men be faithful to to last be good shot of yours percy ball struck just in centre of forehead well there be one thing there need be fear at present of attempt of kind fellow must never have dared to make confidant officer might enlist of men in such plot man in azim position must not venture to do so steward be not often popular with men look after think fellow be exception to rule do two men remain with body until morning see that one touch can search pocket now be not likely that cunning knave must be carrying document must incriminate about on person there be nothing in pocket sahib one of soldier said can feel have heavy belt round body take off examine be found that hundred gold mohurs be sewn up in belt first instalment of price of life colonel said here be one apiece for men rest will be laid out in charity there must be score of people who have be made homeless in last day two in morning make thorough search of fellow clothes may have paper sewn up in now percy will go back to house ranee be greatly agitated when heard who be author of attack upon colonel life be terrible roland to think that can trust one that for month life have be endangered by man can not think why waited so long be waiting for safe opportunity a thought colonel replied private apartment be always locked at night during day opportunity for putting knife into without suspicion falling upon be not frequent doubt knew that ghoolab be going to send army here be probably arranged that affair must not take place until arrived a with out of way garrison must probably surrender ghoolab son must only have to enter take possession must moreover gain certain amount of credit for what must be regarded a capture of place might perhaps have done at night idea of putting nand chund guard here must altogether upset plan drive to choose other opportunity at rate can sleep in peace now be morally certain that azim must not run risk of having accomplice especially a must regard a certain that must be able to carry out design without aid morning light showed how terrible have be effect of fire of besieged upon assailant ground for two hundred yard back from fosse be thickly strewn with dead around spot where cannon stood men who have served lay in heap after sending out party to make sure that enemy have retired right force be sent out to collect bring in deserted gun wounded there be over three hundred of latter eight hundred dead be counted shortly afterwards two men with white flag be seen coming down hill colonel officer went out to meet be found that be bearer of request to be permitted to carry away dead colonel readily granted being well pleased indeed at being saved trouble of burying must have be work of great trouble labour owing to willowness of soil large body of men came down for purpose be nightfall before last of body be carried away enemy camp in valley have at daybreak be removed out on to plain mile half farther away so a to be beyond range of gun late in afternoon large force be seen to march in there garrison have doubt that be main body of troop who have attacked in night week passed without further movement then be noticed one morning that tent have be struck shortly afterwards whole army be seen to march away to south of merchant at once sent off messenger to gather news by colonel learnt that be reported that mother of maharajah have consented to demand of army to make war against british officer who have passed through nearest town have stated that be bearer of despatch ordering force who be besieging fortress to return at once to lahore must have be very welcome news for man in camp colonel said soldier must be already sick of business must have cost at least thousand men counting died after fight from wound must have seen well enough that be nothing to what loss must be before place be captured leader must be even more glad fact that movement have be made since repulse show that be at wit end a to what next move must be must have known that repulse might cause mutiny among troop might even cost life must have be glad indeed at news of recall now percy must lose time in warning friend of what be intended may have got news already from lahore can not risk that agent there may be imprisoned killed therefore have better prepare to start for loodiana in hour time nand chund will go with again with fifty men there will doubt be many sirdar moving with follower towards lahore will therefore excite little attention if questioned nand chund will say that be on way to join army will not be quite true be matter will not rest at heavily on conscience lying be not considered great moral offence at time by sikh indeed by native of india to deceive enemy in time of war be considered absolutely meritorious there will be occasion for to say anything one way will appear a head of expedition will pas unnoticed unquestioned nand chund be perfectly capable of talking for dozen others fondness for using tongue at time be one of principal failing be to come straight back again uncle colonel thought for minute two will leave entirely in hand percy be old enough now to act on own account if can be useful be probable that may be very useful owing to acquaintance with language knowledge that have gained of people to resident at loodiana must say that must be best for to put at service must be very useful beginning for must give claim might be of great advantage to in future besides must think must wish to see what be going on there be likely to be stirring event in next few month here will have quiet time of for with war with england on hand one will think of troubling about will need man for work have cut out for do agree with mahtab yes will be sorry very sorry for to go think must be best for always tell that if people go to war with yours be sure to end in punjaub being annexed there will then be career for here will be better so since life must be a yours have be one of constant danger thus then will be much better for to make friend with officer in company service so that may a have pointed out many time become officer of theirs when be master of punjaub will want servant indeed have better have two must be trusty men above thing shrewd fellow too whom can if necessary despatch on difficult errand must say have better let nand chund pick out two of men unless have fancy spoke very highly to of chose for last night uncle however will speak to do so percy man may be

sympathy must certainly be with countryman will walk down with have chat with nand chund next to good horse good arm good servant be most important point on entering on campaign handy fellow will make comfortable under almost circumstance while with one who have not knack of cooking of managing thing for comfort will be in sort of strait when matter be explained to officer said must not do better than take akram chunder be pathan one of men have last night be sohan verdi own man for time major be hot tempered spoke sharply to one day chose to go back into rank again sohan have told more than once that be one of best men ever have be good soldier have be in service for ten year have high character for courage think that young sahib can do better than take a to other will have own man bhop lal be invaluable man in field merry good tempered eager to please ready to do anything for master comfort here however have be too long inactive be getting idle be going on campaign must be sorry indeed to part with a be can find man who will suit just a well be very man for young sahib be intelligent trustworthy good groom cook then percy can not do better than try send for to come to house at once will myself speak to see how like proposal man who go unwillingly have much better stop behind be obliged to nand chund for giving up man to nephew ten minute later servant announced that two men be at door be at once brought in nephew be going to loodiana colonel began may be that will remain with friend have of course heard news that maharanee have yielded to wish of army that be going to war with english nephew be going to join own people will daresay remain with until war be over want two servant good fellow who can be thoroughly relied upon who can look after comfort in field carry message if necessary from one end of country to other who can be relied upon to be thoroughly faithful devoted to have consulted nand chund have strongly recommended wish to go unless be perfectly willing to do so while be with will receive double pay present will not be wanting when return here if give good report on service now what do say men expressed willingness to follow percy be evident by manner that considered small honour to have be selected to attend upon colonel nephew be settled then colonel said need tell nothing about duty for be accustomed to work will see that be well mounted have good arm brace of pistol replied in affirmative make preparation at once nand chund will start in hour with fifty men to escort nephew to loodiana men saluted retired colonel gave order that two good horse must be picked out for three quarter of hour later percy rode out from gate of fortress with escort two follower falling in in rear being time unencumbered by baggage animal march be more rapid than have be on way up a country be full of armed party making way to lahore passage attracted attention until turned off from road to city after avoided town riding without halt for twelve hour crossed sutlej on evening of fifth day on following morning rode into loodiana considerable change have taken place since percy have left six month before then there be two three battalion of troop stationed there now long line of tent showed that force be largely augmented six seven thousand men be collected in camp be evident that british authority be alive to coming danger that must not be surprised by unprovoked invasion of sikh sir henry hardinge have arrived in july a governor general being warned by resident at loodiana other frontier station of probability that sikh army must insist upon war overcome opposition on part of maharanee have quietly made preparation for event by moving up considerable body of troop to north west have indeed for time be evident that unless ghoolab singh accepted office of prime minister trouble must come be one man in country whose personal power influence must enable to control mutinous army refusal to accept post rendered certain that struggle must come sooner later ghoolab possessed talent astuteness equal to of brother dhyan be like convinced that power of england be too great for of sikh be therefore strongly against war on other hand position be difficult one have attempted to stem tide of popular clamour own army must have turned against might have lost possession life be therefore obliged to temporize believed that must gain advantage way struggle went to sikh then professed complete agreement with view at same time under one excuse remained at jummoo replying to repeated request that must advance with army to lahore by saying that be perfectly ready to do so that thought must be in respect better to keep army a separate force so co operate with main body on other hand sent secret message to british assuring of friendship promising that whenever saw opportunity must throw whole weight of influence power into scale on side nand chund detachment of cavalry did not enter loodiana took leave of percy when came within sight of place started at once on return will travel by road said if must be questioned hereafter can strongly deny report that have paid visit to loodiana for be known must excite feeling against lord who must be accused of being in communication with english there be be true cause whatever to fear attack upon fortress while war continues might prejudice afterwards if thing go badly with sikh fanatic might endeavour to take vengeance upon give love to uncle aunt tell hope to see again before long percy two follower closed up behind a soon a troop have started rode with into resident be alighting from horse at door of bungalow when percy rode up ah grove be said be wondering whether must see soon heard that army have marched to attack uncle place few day ago agent at lahore wrote there be rumour that have be repulsed with very heavy loss be glad to hear not only for sake because reverse of sort must not raise spirit of army how did end what be here for can tell that while be having tiffin know be about hour have become regular young sikh did not recognize at first glance in finery have worn ever since have be there percy said did not like at first soon got accustomed to be certainly cooler than own clothes there be such prejudice against european that uncle thought that have much better follow example dress in fashion of country brought couple of english suit down with in valise be obliged to ride down in dress in order to escape notice will change before tiffen sir look very well a be grove have come far morning only about ten mile came down with escort of fifty men crossed sutlej yesterday evening left couple of mile outside town well have better go in to old room have wash while take bath tiffen will be ready in quarter of hour two three officer be present at tiffen have difficulty at first in crediting mr fullarton assurance that young sikh to whom introduced be really english lad at tiffen percy related event of siege of fortress at host request must be strong place by description mr fullarton said when percy concluded narration must puzzle even british troop to carry by assault still have doubt engineer must manage somehow to get heavy gun on to hill commanding once there must not hold out long uncle be quite aware of sir sikh be very clumsy with cannon calculated that troop must soon be tired of siege must certainly be very difficult matter to get heavy gun up there there be sort of road round behind through hill believe be mere track uncle thought hardly possible at rate for sikh to bring heavy artillery along only other road be that commanded by gun of fortress run little more than quarter of mile away from gun must not be taken up without very heavy loss after officer have left mr fullarton asked how about grove what be thinking of doing what can do for uncle thought might be of use sir can speak punjaubi well enough to pas a native thought that might accept service a volunteer might find useful in obtaining information communicating with of sikh noble who might be friendly in other way have two men with of whom can be trusted thoroughly a messenger to go into sikh camp if necessary to gather information started moment sikh moved away from before fortress have news that be summoned to join main army at lahore a maharanee have given way to wish of war party news be so important that uncle sent off at once thinking that probably agent at lahore might be unable to send news a anyone known to be in communication with must probably be arrested at once when war be finally determined on be first bearer of news mr fullarton said be ten day since have message from lahore be in letter agent sent news that first assault on fortress have failed said then that war party have completely gained ascendency that thought final decision must shortly be taken warned that might be unable to send further news at present a be in very bad odour being known be in communication with that be sure to be watched if not imprisoned not having heard felt doubt that war have be decided upon wrote accordingly to authority have have absolute certainty until now a other cause may have prevented agent from writing take seat out in verandah for few minute must send off despatch at once with news also inform brigadier wheeler who be in command here that report that sikh have determined on war be now confirmed after have sent despatch off will join again talk over what be saying about volunteering chapter viii in service percy be not kept waiting long for in twenty minute mr fullarton joined in verandah now about grove have doubt that will be able to make very useful at once accept service a volunteer in civil service know yet whether will accompany troop if march from here if do will take with if not will introduce to general wheeler transfer service to there be great dearth of men who speak punjaubi be quite sure will be very glad to have someone with so well acquainted with language a be expect here shortly be sure to come across to talk matter over with a soon a receives note will introduce to then before come have better change get into english dress be soldier of old school might regard present attire a sort of masquerading receive unpleasant impression of hour later general wheeler three four officer of staff rode up to door have long interview with resident at conclusion servant brought message to percy mr fullarton desired to see have by time changed clothes be young gentleman of whom have be speaking to general resident said a percy entered be nephew of colonel grove who have be many year in sikh service father be officer in own army speaks punjaubi like native have volunteered will be sure be very useful to came out with in same ship from england formed high idea of intelligence be believe wish to enter service of company later on be not without little experience in war for week ago took part in defence of uncle fortress when attacked by fifteen thousand sikh whom beat off handsomely have be telling general wheeler grove that might be very useful in obtaining information in communication with native that fact that there might be little peril in work must not be obstacle to undertaking said that be going to keep by a sort of civilian aide de camp general have be good enough to say that will attach to staff nominally a interpreter in fact a extra aide de camp a assistant speak language well while general be short of officer who know feel that will be of more service to than to consider a lent only will be glad at time if general wheeler no longer requires service to take on in capacity of extra assistant can ride general wheeler asked suppose need hardly ask that a have be living among sikh yes can ride sir in sikh fashion english mr fullarton tell that must pas a native in anything like ordinary conversation must sir a have worn native dress for last ten month be perfectly at home in very well then can consider a from present time attached to staff major clissold will see after must think that a adjutant general of division will find even more useful than must do a aide de camp can leave now grove mr fullarton said wait outside major clissold will speak to presently percy bowed withdrew conversation still continued to turn upon must think one might put in general order clissold either a extra aide de camp a attached to department know what rule of service be with regard to uniform of volunteer attached to army be so seldom done now that really know in old day be dressed believe a officer wo do mr fullarton laughed be going to make civilian of if doe well in campaign might perhaps get gazetted a ensign must be very much better for to have claim on civil side therefore will take upon to appoint a deputy assistant will write to sir henry hardinge asking that temporary appointment may be confirmed seeing urgent necessity for more officer up in language with knowledge of country so may consider appointment made now lend to can put in general order that temporary service of deputy assistant grove have be placed by at disposal a interpreter that be henceforth attached to head quarter staff of division will give established position can wear civilian clothes white helmet so on think will be very good plan general said have two servant with be pathan first rate fellow whom will employ when necessary to obtain information must suggest that be put on ration a matter of convenience to grove must be entered a civilian servant guide be question of money for although lad uncle have reputation for moderation very rare among adventurer who served runjeet singh must be rich man will make note of major clissold said conversation then turned to other matter hour later officer came out rode away mr fullarton said a did so will myself ride over with grove later on then came into verandah where percy be waiting think have done good stroke of business for grove have indeed sir be awfully obliged to although must rather have stayed with must have be glad to have have be better a have arranged will have much greater opportunity for seeing service with brigadier report in favour must come much better from than must from a appointed be probable that will remain at post in case there must be little for to do here while acting a interpreter on staff will have abundant work making bargain for quarter master department for waggon transport finding out about road ford for major clissold in general interpreting work must change head gear that pith topee have got be really better generally wear either helmet cap like forage cap with pugaree wrapt round end falling down behind to keep sun off back of neck spine must advise to adopt for there be getting helmet here when ride about always take one of mounted servant behind be soldierly looking fellow will give weight with native need not tell now will hardly be free to go about quite a like that even when there be nothing for to do will be expected to be at hand if required major clissold be capital fellow to serve under may work hard for there will be immense deal of work to be done be always pleasant agreeable to subordinate be very much liked in force have writing to finish in about hour will be ready to start with so may a well warn two fellow to be ready have forage cap have only worn once twice for be too small for will tell ram singh to put pugaree on if necessary put folded cotton inside lining to make fit hour later rode into head quarter camp have brought interpreter clissold mr fullarton said a entered that officer tent followed by percy horse being held by latter men where be going to stow a there be getting tent furniture here have told man to send over what be necessary a did not know whether grove must have tent to not told to wait till returned before started have put in tent with hunt ca afford tent for subaltern so be doubled up two together hunt happens to be odd man be lucky orderly called out a soldier entered tell mr hunt will be glad if will step here minute later young officer entered hunt here be young gentleman who a told will have to share tent be volunteer in civil service mr fullarton have kindly lent to for time a interpreter be sure want badly enough on staff for none of young fellow be of slightest use with native be son of officer late of service have be for last six month with uncle who be one of runjeet singh colonel still hold fortress be appointed to time ago although ordered by sikh to leave be sure will get on well together hope that will make a comfortable a can introduce to other aide will mess with for present young officer shook hand with percy if will come with will show tent if mind hunt will come with mr fullarton said then can see what be wanted in way of furniture tent be square one with double canvas two wall being four foot apart thus making passage round one side being utilized a bath room receptacle for luggage other being used by servant a living sleeping apartment there be carpet spread over floor native camp bed two folding chair table portable bath want a far a can see mr fullarton said be charpoy couple more chair be hunt agreed be furniture one be allowed think rather hard do think sikh be going to cross sutlej sir of course may do so general impression be that will not be in force may begin by making raid probably real fighting will take place when get across well now will leave grove think will get on very well daresay will meet pretty nearly day be two fellow yours hunt asked a going out of tent with mr fullarton saw two native sitting like statue on horse in front of tent while one of held bridle of percy horse yes be two servant be two of uncle soldier have be officer servant be extremely useful fellow can trust thoroughly one be pathan from hill frontier of other be from cashmere therefore of have special leaning towards sikh be capital horse of yours be very fast have much more endurance than horse of plain uncle bred have european sire dam be considered a having of best blood in punjaub what will tell men to do with horse can picket yours over there line of horse belong to staff own can put with line behind be horse of orderly will go across with see about of soldier will be interfering horse be soon picketed men brought percy saddle valise to tent by night felt quite at home aide de camp be pleasant young men having already be spoken to by major clissold received new comer cordially percy have inquired of hunt a to messing arrangement be well supplied with money said wish of course to pay share of expense can easily be managed hunt replied way be arranged be there be five of long be general aide de camp humphreys lascelles who be deputy assistant quartermaster general egerton who be assistant adjutant general be lieutenant brought up with certain amount of mess store principally liquor be common property will see to morrow what stock be left can hand over sixth of value will go to fund for general expense however be not heavy for being under canvas draw ration meat bread buy what can get in way of vegetable game so on from country people of course if leave before store of liquor be exhausted will a be buy share back again percy found society very agreeable experience of junior officer mess on board ship have prepared for tone of light chaff fun prevailed although by four year youngest of party fact that be acquainted with country expected shortly to invade gave certain weight with others none of whom have be in part of india before be asked innumerable question a to sikh what thought of fighting power have to recount in full detail story of attempt to storm fortress that uncle of yours must be uncommonly plucky fellow to hold on there in face of whole of sikh must be amazingly liked by troop for to stick to against own countryman be not so wonderful percy said for sikh be constantly fighting against other most of men have served under for eight ten year rest be recruited in district be only conquered by sikh in runjeet time so be still considered a interloper by native still of course there be always fear of treachery uncle nearly lost life while attack be going on man who attempted be one of trusted most thoroughly being steward head of household did not tell about hunt said how be percy have to tell story shot well have never shot man yet know how must feel be very uncomfortable afterwards not in slightest be going to kill uncle fired went down thought nothing more about till mentioned to uncle after be over suppose be good shot be fair shot percy said have practised nearly day since left england except when be travelling up country mr fullarton advised to do so on board ship uncle kept regularly at riding sword exercise day partly because said thing must be most useful to partly because sikh look up to anyone who can do thing better than can must be awfully jolly to be able to speak language grove lieutenant egerton said hear speak like native must have wonderful knack of picking up language to have learnt so completely in six month be not exactly in six month have studied hindustani before left england luckily mr fullarton have punjaubi servant with worked with regularly five six hour day throughout voyage so that be able to get on pretty fairly with language by time got out here wish have spent voyage a well egerton laughed instead of spending spooning with young woman who be on way out to be married who did marry man week after landed thing be very sad egerton lieutenant lascelles laughed suppose be heart broken for time not quite will do justice to say that made secret of engagement never flattered with hope that intended to break at same time have objection to flirt with being understood thing on side that be to end with voyage be very pleasant while lasted must have be very much wiser to have done a grove did spent hot hour of day in getting up language must be hundred year better off if have passed in one of dialect besides must have have much better chance of getting good appointment ah well can console egerton by thinking that if have must be now in small cantonment down in bengal instead of having chance of seeing fun may be going on here be consolation certainly hunt care how soon fun begin for own be getting sick of bargaining for bullock working like horse eight ten hour day be very well for aide de camp whose work consists in writing few letter for chief cantering across with message for hard worked quarter master be holiday here do hope most heartily that sikh will not be long before begin raid give decent excuse for fighting how strong do think be likely to turn out grove tell hundred thousand must say good deal more than percy replied there will be over hundred thousand troop for who have passed through rank will be certain to rejoin then great sirdar can put almost a many fighting men into field sound serious suppose there be doubt will fight bravely that be sure to do percy said what force do think will be able to put in field there be over ten thousand men at ferozepore with twenty four gun here have by field state to day seven thousand two hundred thirty five twelve gun at umballa there be about thirteen thousand men with thirty two gun see ever since hardinge came out have seen thing brewing have be quietly preparing for when landed in india last year there be at three station only between thirteen fourteen thousand men forty eight gun in last eighteen month have increased force by seventeen thousand men twenty gun at meerut there be about ten thousand men twenty six gun a place be two hundred fifty mile away ca count upon assistance from there at first if sikh must take into head to cross sutlej of course if invade will wait until meerut force be brought up before advance sir henry arrived at umballa on second be to leave yesterday ostensibly be not here for warlike purpose be occupied in making inspection of protected district interviewing chief ascertaining what feeling be towards state voluntarily put under protection five thirty year ago having desire to fall under sway of lahore have greatly benefited for runjeet singh must assuredly have annexed whole territory between sutlej jumna if have not be warned that if attacked petty prince must bring into field against have always be sore point with sikh beyond sutlej that prevented from obtaining what considered natural boundary protected state be indeed to great extent sikh even now although owe continuance of existence a separate state to protection chief be with sympathy of great body of people be entirely with sikh across sutlej runjeet singh be wise enough to know that must have risked losing all have be to try to wrest from have thought strong enough must have risked war for for country south of sutlej be far more fertile than be to north must largely increase revenue of punjaub did form part of be real cause of hostility to of present threatening attitude sir henry be going a said among chief here of be really friendly others only pretend to be so there be one thing certain if misfortune happened to arm whole country must be up against in case will have to take possible precaution to guard depot communication for directly fighting begin must be unsafe for small party to travel about country percy stay in camp be of very short duration for on following evening major clissold sent for general have just received despatch from head quarter grove news from north be to effect that sikh be making great preparation there major broadfoot chief political agent at head quarter request that will at once proceed there to join a wish to question a to own personal observation of state of feeling a came down think probable will keep with for present a may have more important work to do there than buying bullock so on hope for sake will do so though will be sorry to lose for have already found by work to day that must be very valuable assistant still there be nothing like being at head quarter having eye of chief of department upon have better start evening late very well sir will be off in hour suppose can ride round say good bye to mr fullarton certainly there be absolute occasion to start until morning be always well to show zeal will doubt please broadfoot if arrive there by daybreak need start till two o'clock be only three hour ride head quarter camp be close to basseean be sorry be going hunt said when percy returned to tent told news hope will be back again in day two if not will save trouble of taking stock of liquor be going to do to morrow morning will be glad at rate to have have a guest for day will be sorry at leaving percy at once rode over to residency be in luck grove mr fullarton said when told of order have received there be nothing like getting to head quarter be there honour reward fall thickest if broadfoot keep with may be sure that recommendation make in favour will be attended to have heard afternoon that sikh be certainly marching down towards ferozepore be within few mile of river of course may not cross once twice before have come down without crossing still if be in earnest there be doubt mean serious fighting for force at ferozepore be quite isolated will at once be cut off if sikh cross near town there will be chance of relieving until get together force sufficient to give battle sit down moment will write letter of introduction for to broadfoot will put on pleasanter footing with next morning before sunrise percy with two follower rode into head quarter camp have at mr fullarton recommendation bought pony tat a be called to carry valise dress a young sikh sirdar must stick to grove may be of use to there be saying what work broadfoot may give percy be on arrival directed to tent of political agent when orderly took in name be at once called

think that sikh will be mad enough to cross sutlej have doubt about sir be convinced that troop have for long time made up mind to conquer protected state a be completely master of situation in lahore there be nothing to prevent doing so such be also opinion of native officer although did not have much communication with people on way down whom did speak to seemed to think that war be certain news received from lahore have always be other way major broadfoot said have received message morning to same effect captain nicholson reported yesterday from ferozepore that considerable sikh force have arrived within three mile of river order have be sent for general forward movement of troop sir henry be going to ride over to loodiana morning to inspect force there have two follower sir who can be trusted to obtain news may desire to get if like one of will cross river make way to sikh force opposite ferozepore find out strength whether there be intention of crossing if prefer will go have always be accustomed to wear sikh dress since came out must think pas without suspicion be most important that must obtain definite news major broadfoot said be much obliged to for offer think can entertain be too great risk for to run to go importance of question be so great must not dare to forward information must perhaps involve movement of whole army merely upon report of native however trustworthy may be believe there be danger whatever in going sir might take two men with must disguise in dress similar to theirs own be that of young sirdar might so far attract attention might be questioned while three of in ordinary soldier dress must move about without being noticed in way be just sort of work came here to do uncle thought that a boy must pas unquestioned where man must not do so one of men be five six thirty so must pas well enough a son if question be asked think must be case well grove if be ready to go think justified in refusing offer a be of such extreme importance to find out intention of sikh when will start must give horse hour rest sir then will be off if can get disguise by time can manage for have number of native in pay can get what require native dress

within couple of hundred yard of body of sikh horseman encamped in grove there be sign of movement among few figure sat talking together here there rest have evidently lain down to sleep hour away in shade chapter ix moodkee ferozeshah two hour after crossing river percy with two companion saw on plain camp of sikh a did not wish to enter until evening turned off from road rode into clump of thick bush quarter of mile away there waited until sunset then mounted again rode boldly into camp with exception of tent of few of military chief sirdar troop be not under canvas although many have erected shelter of bush blanket here there attempt at regularity marked place where regiment of regular troop have established here horse be picketed in line among follower of sirdar man have fastened up horse just where pleased without smallest attempt at order new comer chose vacant spot at edge of encampment picketing three horse together raised in front of rough tent consisting of couple of blanket supported by stick have cut in bush here lighted fire cooked meal one two of sikh strolled across to question bhop lal comrade repeated story have be told at ford be accepted a perfectly satisfactory in turn asked few question a to various sirdar present a to body have better attach when have finished meal sauntered off into camp there be one topic of conversation among troop be to cross sutlej if not on next day on one following portion of army be to besiege ferozepore while rest marched forward to sweep away british force at loodiana umballa be evident from conversation that greatly under estimated british strength at of cantonment that gradual arrival of reinforcement have passed entirely unnoticed by sikh on northern side of sutlej anticipated difficulty whatever in destroying british force at first onset statement a to number of troop who must take field at once agreed with of soldier at ford deemed that fifty thousand men must amply suffice to conquer whole country north of jumna that with full fighting power must be able to overrun whole of india have heard that want percy said to men after have strolled for hour in sikh camp have best move quietly off at once before camp begin to get quiet fire will have burnt out by time even if must notice moving men near will suppose that be merely shifting quarter be moving over to sirdar have decided to follow have difficulty in finding tent again in darkness a soon a did so blanket be taken down rolled up strapped behind saddle picket peg be pulled up leading horse moved off skirting for time line of camp gradually increasing distance until two hundred yard away from when thought quite safe to mount ride off in darkness have trouble in striking road again when did so halted for consultation be decided to turn off encamp again for three four hour in order to rest horse then to make for river bank wait there until first light of morning showed point where must swim horse across for presence of guard at ford rendered impossible for to use passage again plan be carried out arrived at bank three four mile below ford just a daylight began to appear bed of river be wide stream broken by sand bank flowed in several channel there will be no great difficulty in crossing anywhere here percy said channel be nowhere very wide even if be swept down stream will not matter a can rest after swim have better start at once must there be sikh about will hardly make out till get lighter may hope to be pretty well beyond musket shot before can come down to water edge will not be likely to try to follow across if do so with start of quarter of hour ought to be able to throw off track be not disturbed while making passage be however more difficult than percy have anticipated for current in two of channel be very strong swept down distance before must obtain footing on sand bank apparently watch be kept by sikh excepting at ford nothing be seen of enemy on reaching opposite bank gave horse short rest to recover breath then rode on to basseean what be back already major broadfoot said when percy be shown into tent did not expect back until to morrow at earliest have really be in sikh camp yes sir be there about three hour be quite sufficient to learn everything that required then gave officer news that have gathered be most important major broadfoot said sir henry returned hour

british territory rank of sirdar zemindars tenant in said possession who must evince fidelity to british government must be respected governor general called upon chief sirdar to co operate cordially with british government who did so must find interest promoted thereby while who took opposite course must be considered a enemy treated accordingly inhabitant of territory on left bank of sutlej be requested to abide peacefully in respective village party of men found in arm must be treated a disturber of public peace fortunately sikh after crossing on th instead of marching at once upon basseean halted until heavy gun be taken across on th on afternoon of th general wheeler who have marched at daybreak arrived in front of basseean on th general gough commander in chief arrived there with force from umballa have sikh pushed forward at once after crossing basseean with great store of provision must have fallen into hand week ten day must have elapsed before arrangement for provisioning umballa force must have be made in case whole sikh army must have be able to concentrate effort upon capture of ferozepore in absence of fortification capable of withstanding powerful artillery must scarcely have be defended successfully percy have be kept actively employed during three day intervened between return to basseean arrival of column from umballa in work of carrying

threatening invasion fact that odds must be enormously against be considered matter of importance for british troop have so long be accustomed to victory in india that idea of reverse be not entertained for moment among soldier although among officer who be aware of bravery fighting power of sikh prospect be regarded with good deal of anxiety account received bore out correctness of information that percy have obtained twenty five thousand sikh regular soldier have taken possession of well round village of ferozeshah half way between basseean ferozepore entirely cut communication between two place for owing to scarcity of water other road must be used for advance of army except passing through sikh be well aware of fact on arrival have at once begun to throw up strong

taken up position three mile away there be indeed twelve thousand of principally cavalry with twenty gun from friend at basseean have learnt that advance be to be made by british thinking that must be advance guard lal singh have with body of troop left camp at ferozeshah early in morning have taken up position before arrival of british army at moodkee a soon a news be received troop got under arm moved forward artillery cavalry leading way infantry following in support when have gone two mile enemy be seen ahead of country be dead flat covered at short interval with low thick jungle dotted with sandy hillock be difficult to judge of strength of sikh force in order to oblige to display cavalry with five troop of horse artillery moved forward a infantry formed into line opened fire be answered by very heavy cannonade on part of enemy in very short time rapid fire of horse artillery aided by two field battery so discomfited enemy gunner that fire gradually subsided in order to allow infantry to advance without artillery in front of being pushed forward too closely to jungle sir hugh gough ordered portion of cavalry to make movement on enemy flank d light dragoon governor general body guard th light cavalry portion of th lancer dashed round left of sikh army sweeping along whole of rear forced artilleryman to leave gun put cavalry to flight at same time remainder of th lancer th irregular cavalry with light field battery performed brilliant charge round enemy right successful a operation be must have be much more so have not enemy be so hidden in jungle that position must scarcely be made out british gun again opened fire infantry advanced evening be now falling increasing darkness added to difficulty of attack through thick jungle sikh fought stoutly several time clung to position until driven from at point of bayonet be not able to withstand steady pressure of british advance astounded discomfited at unexpected valour of foe whom professed to despise fell back from point to point finally made off in darkness have battle commenced at early hour cavalry must have converted defeat of enemy into rout a be seventeen of twenty gun be captured loss in killed wounded be very severe lal singh be wounded have narrow escape of being taken prisoner british loss be sixteen officer two hundred men killed forty eight officer six hundred nine men wounded sir

twenty five thousand regular troop ten thousand irregular with eighty eight gun while tej singh with twenty three thousand regular twenty seven gun be only ten mile distant country be dead flat studded with tree jungle cloud of dust rose beneath foot of troop rendered extremely difficult to direct movement in such country skirmisher be sent forward to ascertain exact position of enemy troop be allowed to rest for time after hot dusty march commander in chief must gladly have waited until next morning before calling upon for effort must be necessary to carry position so strong a occupied by sikh be however impossible to wait for there be water moreover tej singh with army must certainly be up before morning at moodkee percy have seen little of fighting although for hour have be under fire place be behind major broadfoot who be with commander in chief staff jungle at first darkness afterwards shut out absolute conflict from view a enemy cannon ball flew overhead ploughed up sand air resounded with sharp short ping of musket ball feeling a sat inactive on horseback be one of far greater discomfort than have felt when exposed to even heavier fire at attack on uncle fortress that british be winning knew by advance be from time to time made by party by fact that firing gradually receded have be under fire before grove major broadfoot said to so suppose mind certainly like sir before have something to do did not think much of danger must not at mind if be to send with message into thick of to sit here doing nothing with ball buzzing about be certainly very unpleasant be unpleasant find so major said a post be here with commander in chief there be errand on can send must sit out if general want to send message aide de camp be away will tell that will carry for there be however message to be sent beyond fact that troop be steadily advancing commander in chief knew little of what be going on be soldier battle except for flank movement of cavalry there be manoeuvring regiment pressed straight forward pushing enemy back wherever found will see more of to day grove major said a be waiting for order for troop to advance against sikh intrenchment there be daylight a task of carrying position will certainly be severe one sir hugh will move forward with men be likely to be in thick of sikh intrenchment be about mile in length mile in breadth including within area strong village of ferozeshah sikh have advantage of being thoroughly acquainted with country a be prepared for attack upon side of position be decided that effort must be made against long front british be formed in three division commanded respectively by major general gilbert sir john littler brigadier general wallace be formed in line with whole of artillery in centre with exception of troop of horse artillery on flank one in support second line be composed of cavalry reserve under sir harry smith artillery be first moved to front battle began by discharge from mortar battery sikh did not reply whole of artillery then opened fire to ascertain position of enemy battery when sikh at once responded whole line then advanced again artillery opened fire movement be repeated until gun be within three hundred yard of enemy intrenchment in spite of much more rapid fire of gun artillery be unable to silence of enemy whose piece be protected to great extent by earthwork seeing general gave order for infantry to advance to storm intrenchment general littler division directed march against village by so doing caused opening in line between brigadier wallace division in spite of terrible storm of grape from enemy battery heavy sikh musketry fire littler men held on way until close up to work then be unable longer to withstand storm of fire fell back left brigade of reserve under sir harry smith be at once ordered forward to fill up opening left in line advanced against village with splendid bravery wallace gilbert division on right centre be more successful than of littler gallantly stormed intrenchment in front of in spite of desperate bravery of sikh just a have achieved feat night fell suddenly a doe in india air be obscured by dust smoke none knew position of troop to right left of great pile of dry forage be alight in sikh camp frequent explosion of loose powder took place sir harry smith brigade have stormed village held be in complete ignorance of what be taking place elsewhere while littler division have suffered terribly in advance have retired one knew in direction just before dark d dragoon on extreme right be ordered to charge dashed headlong into sikh camp adding to utter confusion prevailed there cutting down number of enemy losing ten officer hundred twenty men out of four hundred to advance further be hopeless there be saying what obstacle might be encountered in darkness friend might fire into other regiment lose way be destroyed order regularity be lost consequently sir hugh gough fearing to keep men in position in must be exposed to be overthrown piecemeal by rush of enemy told officer about to ride off order troop to abandon position have won retire outside intrenchment there to lie down in readiness for renewed attack in early morning wallace gilbert division obeyed order sir harry smith received none after holding village until about ten o'clock at night knowing nothing of position of troop on right abandoned also fell back position of british be most serious whereabouts of division of sir harry smith general littler must not be discovered other two division thinned by loss might be attacked in morning by vastly superior force for be probable that tej singh with army must arrive during night sikh have withdrawn gun a british rushed forward to assault so artillery be still intact a soon a found that intrenchment be evacuated advanced kept up continuous fire of cannon musketry at unseen foe who be lying hundred fifty yard away fire of one of battery be so destructive that sir henry hardinge mounted horse called to th regiment lad will have sleep until take gun regiment leapt to foot at once advanced supported by st bengal european again stormed intrenchment drove sikh from gun spiked retired percy have have nothing to do during advance when order be given for troop to retire have assisted to carry to different regiment a whole of sir henry hardinge staff with exception of son have be killed wounded a have most of of sir hugh gough major broadfoot have fallen captain nicholson assistant political agent be also killed indeed political agent with one exception be either killed wounded percy have felt almost bewildered with roar din of battle feeling of excitement be so great that although officer after officer fell round thought of danger to scarcely entered mind mechanically followed with rest of staff a general have ridden hither thither along line felt almost a one in dream until be called upon with rest of officer round general to carry order to troop to retire on return from duty sir henry hardinge begged of to ride off to try discover whereabouts of missing division accompanied by two men who have kept short distance behind during fight have escaped unwounded rode about for hour in jungle without success be indeed lost at last threw off horse to wait till morning must show bearing of enemy camp few word have be exchanged between follower during ride for be still dazed by battle be parched with thirst exhausted by fatigue emotion have be terrible day said a threw down on ground after flinging bridle over bough of low tree to prevent horse from straying have indeed sahib akram chunder replied never did hear so terrible roar of fire thought that time have come for seemed a if man must be swept away looked like madness to attack position did not think that men must do be wonderful bhop lal joined in truly british be marvellous fighter sikh be coward yet though must have be two to one have strong intrenchment behind gun be sheltered must not withstand have wondered often how be that so many kingdom have be conquered so many army defeated by countryman now wonder no longer when said that english must certainly beat sikh thought be wrong though be not for to contradict now see that be right sikh have found master after boasting have be defeated on own ground with number position everything in favour be not defeated yet percy said have again entered intrenchment if tej singh come up during night number will be overwhelming english will win bhop lal said carelessly be not to be conquered besides sikh move slowly tej singh will not be up till morning have bread cold meat in valise percy have flask of brandy water two follower waterskin hung from horse saddle percy be only able to eat few mouthful then fell asleep follower ate hearty meal remained smoking talking until when day began to break aroused master bhop lal climbed up into highest tree must find exclaimed there be intrenchment sahib two mile away at least mounted rode off with speed found troop already forming up commander in chief sir henry hardinge placed in front of troop in order to prevent from firing moving round to right entered intrenchment with slight opposition enemy gun be taken in reverse wheeling round past village of ferozeshah british line swept down through sikh encampment did not halt until reached work on opposite side scarcely have won sikh position captured gun seventy four in number when army of tej singh appeared in view marching towards division of smith littler have passed night in jungle have joined force just a entered enemy work troop now prepared to defend position have won no attack however be made crowd of sikh fugitive made for army saw advancing to assistance rushing down in confusion disordered front line communicated panic to newly arrived troop after opening fire for time at distance rendered perfectly innocuous tej singh troop turned marched away to river crossed without halt british be too weak in cavalry to follow up enemy several regiment have be sent off at daybreak to ferozepore in order to water horse a must have be useless against sikh intrenchment while remained be unfit for active work animal having be twenty four hour without food water delight of army be immense at unexpectedly easy termination of fight at one time have looked well nigh lost a sir hugh gough governor general rode down line saluted with outburst of cheer loss however have be heavy have fallen chiefly upon european who have four hundred eighty eight killed eleven hundred three wounded out of total of six hundred ninety four killed one thousand seven hundred twenty one wounded of whom five hundred ninety five died subsequently be permanently disabled a soon a sikh retreated effort be made to succour wounded by noon be in quarter at ferozepore provided with cot blanket among killed be major somerset military secretary to governor general colonel wallace major baldwin old peninsular officer many other officer distinguished for bravery d went into battle weak in number have seven officer killed ten wounded seventy six rank file killed one hundred fifty four wounded regiment belonged to general littler division have advanced against strongest part of sikh position after engagement be over percy reported to captain mill only one of political officer who have escaped unwounded be glad that lad went through uninjured sir henry hardinge said when captain mill reported that be only assistant available for service be very plucky young fellow noticed several time during fight be always cool collected even under heaviest fire major broadfoot reported to very strongly upon conduct in going into sikh camp obtaining for trustworthy report of strength intention mentioned that be only volunteer serving without pay appointed temporarily by resident at loodiana on civil staff will be glad if when send in written report to will specially mention name although sikh invasion have be repelled with such heavy loss of gun men british be in condition to follow up advantage be to cross river might expect to meet force far larger than have defeated be without heavy gun with to attack fortified town number be altogether insufficient for such enterprise a conquest of punjaub be therefore forced for time to remain inactive pending arrival of reinforcement siege gun chapter x aliwal sobraon finding that british army did not follow up success at sikh determined to maintain position on left bank proceeded to construct bridge of boat at sobraon not far from spot where have crossed river in flight in front of head of bridge exceedingly strong work be thrown up position be very well chosen bridge being placed in curve of river artillery posted on bank on side be high be therefore able to sweep ground across force must advance to attack work ten thousand men under sirdar runjoor singh be also thrown across river near loodiana in order not only to menace place with small garrison to cut off passage of supply for ferozepore to interrupt communication between two post a soon a force at meerut consisting of th th lancer th d foot d th native regiment arrived with battering train step be taken to reinforce loodiana basseean with heavy gun additional troop be sent to of post sick with woman child be removed thence sent to umballa sir harry smith division be increased to seven thousand men twenty four gun be despatched to drive force threatened loodiana across river to cover line of british communication whole country in quarter be in state of disorder advance of runjoor singh have caused great excitement among peasantry while created something like panic among european resident of umballa simla either of place must have be reached plundered by sikh who from crossing point near loodiana be two day march nearer to than be army of commander in chief be important to sir harry smith to reach loodiana where being on flank of sikh army must advance must be necessary for to meet defeat before ventured upon raiding expedition to do be necessary to pas within short distance of runjoor singh position a column passed along sikh sallied out opened heavy fire cut off considerable portion of baggage of force taking several officer prisoner sir harry smith did not suffer to be diverted from object to be forced to fight battle save on ground of own choosing without returning fire pressed forward until reached troop being completely exhausted with effort have made more political officer having come up with force from meerut sir henry hardinge have placed percy service at disposal of sir harry smith be mere lad said to latter will find quite a valuable for most purpose a older man must be speaks language like native can go in disguise obtain information may require have plenty of pluck be close behind commander in chief through fight here be one of few of staff who escaped uninjured be volunteer serving without pay doubt in hope of obtaining civil employment under government in future have already richly earned not only by service in battle of ferozeshah by obtaining most valuable news by going in disguise to sikh camp before crossed river poor broadfoot reported on conduct very warmly indeed in almost last official document sent in having seen young fellow under fire will certainly at proper time take advantage of broadfoot report to recommend to board of director for appointment in civil service for special employment upon frontier being recommended to in manner sir harry smith have at once taken percy upon staff more than once sent for questioned a to country width of river other point a percy have on way down crossed sutlej not far from aliwal be able to give valuable information on subject a soon a reached loodiana went to see friend mr fullarton back again grove be fortunate in getting through fight at ferozeshah where poor broadfoot several other politicals be killed wounded have note from written day before saying how useful have found have come up with sir harry smith suppose yes sir be very short of officer who speak language so sent on with show think well of be glad be doing credit to recommendation see be very much better for to go with army than to remain here with now have be through two battle have fairly earned right to permanent post in service mind let put on uncovenanted branch will get very few chance of real promotion there must offer be made to have better decline respectfully say that must rather wait in hope of entering company service in regular way three four year waiting must do harm though suppose will have to wait anything like time before get appointed to service be quite content to wait sir for at age must be absurd to think of getting such important appointment be very glad indeed to have found opportunity of seeing so much will have battle here in day two mr fullarton said have just seen sir harry say must give troop couple of day rest before advance to attack runjoor singh indeed there be hurry now that be here sikh dare not advance be therefore master of situation be bad affair losing so much of baggage at buddeewal general be right in not bringing on battle troop be worn out with long march must have fought at great disadvantage must not have made much difference to white soldier who be always ready to fight however tired may be be not so with native fatigue hunger thirst always depress spirit native who in morning must have fought stoutly by side of own men must be worth nothing if taken into field tired hungry on evening of same day hear that of native regiment did not do at well at ferozeshah have doubt that be reason of will have very short march before fight time after day rest force moved out again to buddeewal runjoor singh force have just received reinforcement of four thousand regular troop with twelve gun army now amounted to nineteen thousand men sixty gun early in morning of th of january sir harry smith marched from buddeewal towards enemy sikh be so inspirited by success have attended attack on column during passage success attributed to fear on part of british that instead of waiting to be attacked in intrenchment have formed moved forward took up post in open village of aliwal being key of position troop be already advancing in order of battle column be at once directed to attack carry village artillery preparing way by heavy fire sikh gun opened along line fire be very wild most of shot went far overhead attacking force suffered little did not fire shot in return when within short distance of village went at with rush carrying at point of bayonet driving sikh infantry headlong before gun defending fell into hand a soon a established in village rest of force moved forward with admirable regularity whole sikh line be driven backwards leaving gun behind th lancer charged enemy who be falling back sullenly in order sikh threw down on ground slashed at horse with sword a passed over discharged musket at rider regiment lost upwards of hundred men killed wounded a fell back horse artillery opened upon dense mass of sikh infantry continued steady advance cavalry again again charged instead of retiring towards intrenchment having be denuded of gun be now untenable enemy retreated direct upon river crossed at ford loss be comparatively small to have suffered at perozeshah whole of gun fell into hand of british only one have be carried across river be captured spiked by irregular horse horse artillery who crossed river in pursuit total loss of british in killed wounded in battle of aliwal be only four hundred astonishingly small amount when be considered that attacked brave enemy of double strength in men gun victory be most important one relieved north west of fear of invasion enabled commander in chief to direct whole attention to concentrating force against main body of sikh army at sobraon percy have watched conflict from distance have a usual taken place among staff when general mounted horse to advance against sikh intrenchment when sir harry smith eye fell upon said will not ride with to day mr grove can have occasion for service a political officer will not have risk life uselessly by exposing to fire will therefore please follow at considerable distance will when get within enemy range take up position like will enable to see what be going on at same time keep out of fire percy looked little downcast sir harry added kindly be reflection on courage lad send back governor general told how fearlessly have exposed at ferozeshah a require on duty have justification for taking with under heavy fire percy brightened up a rode off sir harry smith staff be for most part stranger to a have not be connected with until marched have feared at first that might be thought general have ordered to rear because doubted steadiness under fire be only to look on to day said to two follower a joined when reined up horse on little knoll affording view of enemy position mile away very good thing too sahib bhop lal said bluntly have quite enough of being shot at other day have stomach for sitting on horseback again doing nothing while be pelting with shot bullet if sahib said 'charge ' must follow into middle of sikh incampment a for sitting doing nothing want more of ' besides akram chunder put in know about now for if what people say be true a to runjoor singh strength odds be not so great a be at ferozeshah even though have seventy gun to thirty what be that british be not to be stopped by gun will do a did other day go right at sikh beat sikh have thrown away only chance by coming out from intrenchment besides will not fight so well a did last time then thought be invincible now know that british be better fighter than be that make difference may a well dismount percy said picket horse down behind can see well enough over jungle on foot if sikh gunner must notice three mounted men might take for officer of importance send few shot in direction sikh gunner however be too occupied with foe marching against to notice detached figure shot came in direction during battle percy two follower watched capture of aliwal then saw whole british force advance with scarce pause push back sikh along line truly be wonderful bhop lal said stroking beard men in red coat make more of fire of sixty gun than if be child plaything a for sikh infantry though more than twice number seem to sweep before like chaff thought knew something of fighting feel to day know nothing for have seen nothing like from day when first handled sword loss can not have be very heavy percy said have be done too quickly be way sahib akram chunder remarked if men have courage to go on in face of heavy fire suffer much le than if hesitate delay be only lion who rush forward with sixty cannon firing at to say nothing of thousand of men with musket be what take life out of sikh fighting be brave be accustomed to victory when see men rushing on against in spite of fire thought must have swept away lose confidence in say what use be to fight against men like bring up horse bhop lal may a well ride forward now that battle be nearly over for believe roll of musketry discharge of gun still going on be caused by troop firing at sikh a recross river great be satisfaction prevailed among troop at splendid victory have gained over enemy of nearly thrice force in men gun that with loss considering number engaged strength of intrenchment be trifling a after so crushing defeat a there be little chance of loodiana being again threatened of large force endeavouring to intercept communication sir harry smith marched back with army rejoined commander in chief on th of february on following day heavy gun from delhi arrived order be given for whole force to prepare for attack on sobraon during fortnight sir harry smith have be absent sikh have continued to labour unceasingly at intrenchment be erected under superintendence of two three of foreign officer who have be in runjeet singh service be not regarded by sikh with same hostility with viewed colonel grove two three other english speaking officer have indeed be deprived of command at demand of army who objected to european discipline to severe method by be enforced several of have be allowed to remain in country sikh when war began gladly availed of scientific knowledge in erection of intrenchment enemy have surrounded position with work of great strength must only be surmounted by aid of scaling ladder work be so arranged that afforded complete protection to three line of infantry one above who must thus pour tremendous fire upon advancing foe work be held by men with seventy gun be connected by well built bridge also by ford with camp of men across river gun of force placed on high bank be in position to play upon flank of army advancing against sobraon to attack formidable position sir hugh gough have men of whom be european native force therefore be numerically inferior by men to with attacked sikh at ferozeshah artillery force have however be augmented to ninety nine gun by addition of thirty four heavy gun mortar commander in chief relied upon artillery to clear way for assault of infantry army be to be in motion at half past three in morning in order that darkness must not a at moodkee ferozeshah intervene to prevent full result of victory being obtained troop be under arm punctually at precisely hour named marched in silence against sikh position battering gun most of field battery took up post in extended semicircle so a to open fire against point of sikh intrenchment be intended that must commence attack a soon a be light enough for men to point gun heavy mist however hung over country be not until half past six that lifted sufficiently to allow view to be obtained of enemy work then cannon opened along whole line storm of shot shell be poured in by gun mortar battery while rocket be discharged in number against intrenchment sikh replied with equal vigour for time roar of artillery be unbroken have be intended that cannonade must be continued for four hour before infantry be called upon to make advance so rapidly did gunner work piece that ammunition carried with be becoming exhausted long before time have elapsed elephant who must have brought up reserve have become unmanageable from terror at tremendous din even have fire continued during whole day must not have made serious impression upon such strong extended earthwork object be rather to shake courage of defender than to produce material damage loss of sikh be afterwards found to have be heavy general be confident that must repulse attack upon tremendous work have erected tej singh having be assured by in chief engineer french officer named mouton that position be absolutely impregnable while artillery duel be in progress british infantry have remained inactive in rear of gun longing for time when must be called upon to take share in action there be general feeling of satisfaction when fire began to slacken order be given for advance to begin on left be two brigade of general sir robert dick division be to commence engagement seventh brigade commanded by general stacey be to lead attack headed by th foot reinforced by d supported by other brigade general gilbert division be in centre

rest of cavalry be in reserve at nine o'clock stacey brigade supported by three battery moved to attack former marched steadily on in line latter took up successive position at gallop until within three hundred yard of heavy battery of enemy fire of cannon camel gun musketry be so tremendous that seemed to looker on impossible that troop must advance successfully under two british regiment d th native infantry brigaded with advanced however with splendid bravery brigade have not be present at previous battle have be specially selected for desperate service of effecting first breach in enemy line because rank be still intact have not gone through terrible ordeal at ferozeshah have in spite of eventual success greatly impressed engaged in with courage obstinacy of sikh in defending strong position well did seventh brigade deserve confidence commander in chief placed in with scarcely pause troop pressed steadily forward surmounted obstacle until reached crest of intrenchment drove sikh from gun moment success of attack be apparent general gilbert sir harry smith be ordered to advance with division brigadier ashburnham began to move forward brigade to support stacey gilbert advance took in front of centre strongest portion of enemy line although unsupported by artillery th st light infantry dashed forward under withering fire crossed dry nullah in front of intrenchment then found in front of high wall too steep for to climb exposed to terrible fire from above to remain there must have be to be annihilated regiment be withdrawn only to charge again at fresh point thrice reached wall thrice have to fall back time followed by sikh who cut wounded to piece second division however managed at several point to effect lodgment within intrenchment while stacey ashburnham brigade maintained in position former have captured in spite of desperate effort of sikh who in vast number swarmed down upon tried to recapture thus for while battle raged be british able to advance beyond point where have gained footing until sapper cut narrow opening through work by cavalry be able to pas in single file a soon a d dragoon have entered work formed up charging along in rear of intrenchment cut down sikh gunner in battery captured field gun a fire ceased rest of infantry poured into work advancing along whole line while field battery have entered joined fire to of musketry pressed sikh before in mass across river bridge be excellent one one of sikh commander have caused two of boat forming to be removed in order that men seeing there be mode of retreat must defend work more desperately river have risen during night ford have day before be breast deep be now scarcely passable scene be terrible one crowded mass of enemy threw into river strove to cross by wading swimming while gun of british horse artillery have come up played upon unceasingly infantry poured volley of musketry into feeling of pity being for time dissipated by fury with murder of wounded by sikh during early portion of fight have inspired troop hundred of enemy fell under cannonade very many hundred be drowned battle terminated at noon infantry having be engaged without intermission for three hour sixty seven cannon be captured upwards of two hundred camel gun great decisive victory cost engaged in dearly th foot have officer sergeant men killed wounded st european light infantry officer sergeant men st officer men th officer men d officer men be heaviest loss regiment engaged suffered severely a total loss be in killed wounded loss among staff of officer wore small compared to have suffered at ferozeshah a be not necessary at sobraon for governor general commander in chief to expose close to enemy intrenchment a have done on occasion general sir robert dick who have gone through peninsular war led d highlander at waterloo be killed a led men forward against sikh intrenchment brigadier general m'laren taylor also fell loss of sikh be never known carnage be in proportion to number engaged enormous many of leading sirdar be among slain at greater proportion of loss among assailant be caused by grape shot from enemy gun at sobraon on other hand in spite of number weight of enemy gun of very numerous camel piece be musket inflicted great proportion of loss be due in first place to fact that large number of skilled sikh gunner have fallen in previous battle that artillery fire be in consequence very wild ill directed in next place artilleryman be unable to depress piece sufficiently to play upon british when reached foot of intrenchment while infantry well sheltered behind earthwork be able to keep up murderous fire upon helpless foe fact account for unusually large number of men wounded in proportion to killed a division of sir harry smith have only reached camp two day before battle percy remained attached to staff rode behind in engagement have wished two men to remain in camp resolutely declined to do so if be killed sahib how must face colonel tell that while be killed be cooking dinner four mile away sahib come must ride behind general escort have not seen ferozeshah must say that success to morrow be impossible for intrenchment there be dirt heap in comparison to great work opposite can see with own eye how big high be say there be three line of parapet for infantry to fire over besides gun now know that nothing be impossible to white troop believe that somehow though can not say how will capture drive sikh across river if live through will be thing to talk of for rest of life if die will tell colonel sahib that did duty told to watch over though watching can turn course of shot bullet can at least be near to carry off must fall wounded however percy escaped without being hit a did most of staff though did share in carrying order to officer commanding different regiment in division a rode back from field after engagement be over general called up to side ought to have kept out of battle lad said kindly did not like to baulk again have done very well will mention name in report a among member of staff who did good service battle of sobraon completely broke power of sikh in preceding fight picked regiment of regular infantry have be destroyed dispersed two hundred twenty of gun captured time be lost by commander in chief in following up success bridge of boat have be already thrown across river way between ferozepore sobraon message be sent to sir john grey who commanded force there to sir john littler at ferozepore to cross at once at daybreak next morning six regiment crossed sutlej from ferozepore while sir john grey with two regiment of cavalry three of infantry battery crossed by new bridge force thus placing on road by defeated sikh must retire upon lahore speedy movement completed discomfiture cut off from capital deprived of leadership of principal sirdar dispersed to home bridge at sobraon having be repaired on day following battle british crossed without opposition ghoolab singh who have time be negotiating secretly with british while promising sikh that be on eve of advancing to join with whole force now endeavoured to figure a mediator came secretly into british camp with object of persuading governor general to abstain from making advance against lahore sir henry hardinge refused to receive sent message to by political officer that term of peace must be dictated at capital crafty sirdar be not to be defeated riding back to lahore took young maharajah rode with to british camp sir henry received young prince kindly be not to be diverted from purpose of moving forward to lahore where army arrived without shot being fired here term of peace be dictated to humbled sikh expense of war estimated at million half be to be paid gun taken be to be retained others have be used against during war be to be handed over troop be to be disbanded fertile province known a jalindar doab situated between beas sutlej river be to be handed over to british many of officer considered that must have be better to have annexed whole of punjaub even with army be marching from scinde under sir charles napier force be insufficient for work sikh have strongly fortified city must scarcely have be taken without regular battering train hot season be coming on besides although army trained with so much care by runjeet singh have be broken up scattered sikh nation have a yet taken little part in struggle be however certain that must under great chief fight desperately to preserve independence whole of dispersed soldiery must speedily be reunited under banner of leader crafty ghoolab singh gained advantage have hoped for treasury of lahore be empty with greatest difficulty half million be raised to pay first instalment of indemnity ghoolab singh therefore out of vast resource paid half million on condition that cashmere must be handed over to that from being merely governor of province must become independent ruler price paid by for rich province be absurdly inadequate so far a british be concerned bargain be politic one there be little doubt that second war must sooner later have to be undertaken ghoolab singh must put very large army into field by making ruler of cashmere interest be at once separated from of sikh neutrality if not active alliance be secured in future struggle be arranged that british force must remain in lahore for year nominally to insure payment of rest of indemnity really to maintain authority of maharanee boy maharajah who be in way responsible for war against who doubtless must have be overthrown by ambitious sirdar aided by disbanded troop have be left unsupported by british bayonet chapter xi ambush mr fullarton have accompanied army to lahore knowledge of country people being so valuable that governor general sent over on evening after sikh intrenchment at sobraon have be stormed to request to join army at once a loodiana have for present ceased to be station of importance have a soon a joined camp claimed percy grove service in negotiation followed a interpreter between british sikh authority be found of great use especially after reached lahore where many of sikh sirdar especially whose possession lay in jalindar doab considered prudent to come in to assume appearance of friendship with british now grove what be wish a to entering service mr fullarton said to one day when various court ceremonial be over preparation be beginning for withdrawal of main body of army governor general mentioned name to to day said that have rendered very valuable service during campaign mr broadfoot have reported most favourably of have acted a aide de camp to commander in chief at ferozeshah to sir harry smith at latter have mentioned in report a sir hugh gough have observed coolness readiness to carry message under heaviest fire at ferozeshah that since then service a interpreter have be very valuable said that have earned appointment that must be glad to write to board of director to request one for that feared board must consider too young said however if strongly desired to enter service at once must put matter in such light that must hardly refuse for a have be doing man work throughout campaign must do during peace time think own opinion be that must be better for to wait for two three year for if received appointment now might be sent down to office in calcutta see that at age must hardly occupy post must not only place in communication with native chief a british representative might place in position where a political officer might have to requisition assistance of troop of officer old enough to be father quite think so percy said must much rather not enter service for three year sir even then will only be nineteen be about right age to enter mr fullarton said will have great advantage over other young fellow just out there must be record in favour knowledge of language people must be certain to obtain appointment in province such a man direct from england must hardly hope for until after at least ten year service think if be must turn attention for next two year to acquiring a thorough knowledge of pathan language a now have of punjaubi when have annexed punjaub be question of few year will be in direct contact with hill tribe who be nominally subject to afghanistan be practically independent if happened to be stationed in of northern district must find knowledge of language invaluable have evidently knack of picking up language knowledge of punjaubi will of course help considerably in learning pathan a percy be anxious now that everything be settled to return a speedily a possible to uncle at once wrote formal request that service a volunteer might be dispensed with next day mr fullarton said to informed sir henry hardinge yesterday evening that have sent in resignation request to bring to morning that might say good bye to thank for service commander in chief be with governor general when mr fullarton called at palace where have taken up quarter on name being taken in be requested to enter at once did with percy must have be sorry have gone without saying good bye to mr grove sir henry said commander in chief have noted conduct very favourably report to same effect have be made by mr broadfoot sir harry smith think be wise to decide to wait three year before entering service will write to board of director requesting to appoint to civil service at once will ask to date appointment three year on at same time to send instruction to officer who will remain a resident here to effect must there be sign of fresh trouble before time can at once ante date appointment employ in way in knowledge of country language zeal activity can be utilized must still be in india will make point to see that have appointment in province must return to england before time name will be placed in list leave behind for successor of promising intelligent officer sir hugh gough will also tell keep eye on interest doubtless will receive notification from court in due time a to appointment will do well after receive to write to resident here telling that although wish for employment until date of appointment service be at disposal must be required have doubt mr fullarton will before leaving speak to personally on matter commander in chief added few word percy on returning to house began preparation for departure will have to be careful a ride back sahib bhop lal said thing be quiet enough about here from what learn country be overrun with disbanded soldier have gone back for most part to own village what will do there have lived idle life for year quite considered master of country will never set to at steady work to plough field will soon tire out friend then will wander away gather in band become dacoit hear in bazaar that country be everywhere unsafe for travel merchant dare not send good except in strong party guarded by force of disbanded soldier pay to act a guard peasant be robbed plundered thing be even worse than be before war began after getting through battle without so much a scratch must be unfortunate indeed must ill befall now that war be over there be one thing bhop lal will have danger except from accidental encounter with robber now that ghoolab singh be ruler of cashmere will have too many other matter to think of to trouble further about uncle little district nothing be too small a nothing be too large sahib akram chunder said for greed of ghoolab singh may now have kingdom will not prevent from fleecing trader if have opportunity see how have filled coffer at expense of people have not paid half crore of rupee to people for cashmere doubt not must have paid three time a much if have be needed there be many other sirdar must have paid half crore say that ghoolab must buy up four of be true there be fear that will now try to seize colonel sahib government by force at least until fresh trouble begin if can have quietly removed may be sure will do so a must then easily enough get maharanee lahore durbar to confirm former appointment of son a governor colonel need no longer fear force must be more than ever on guard against treachery still sahib agree with just at present ghoolab must have too many thing to think of to be giving attention to matter that can travel without fear of a for budmashes will have to be careful of a comrade say must mind that one suspect for moment that be english for although people here be respectful enough may be sure that outside range of gun there be not sikh save perhaps humblest cultivator who be not full of rage hatred against english have not defeated in four battle humbled national pride taken richest province to be suspected of being englishman must be death warrant in smallest village of punjaub sahib must do well to morrow not to wear dress of sirdar to dress a did when visited camp of tej singh then if be questioned be who will do talking while if be dressed a chief be to question will be put besides most of sirdar be known by name at least to bulk of people must be difficult for to reply to close questioning whereas passing a disbanded soldier who be tired of doing nothing in native village be going north to take service with ghoolab singh story be simple natural enough ghoolab can not be popular in country at present percy said must see now that have be playing double part that have moreover wrenched from punjaub territory a valuable a took after such hard fighting be so ghoolab be everywhere feared man offends without paying for besides may hope that if there be again trouble ghoolab may join against british may not like there must be many disbanded soldier who have be going to take service under people will bear ill will for be most likely story for to tell one will be least questioned think be right akram chunder at rate will ride to morrow dressed a be next morning started from lahore at daybreak rode north have agreed to travel by main road a must there attract attention whereas passing through village on unfrequented road passage must excite comment after riding for fifteen mile came upon party of ten men evidently disbanded soldier seated in shade of clump of tree by roadside cooking breakfast better stop talk with bhop lal said will look strange if ride on reined in horse bhop lal gave usual salutation after customary return of greeting one of men said will not dismount share breakfast took food before started from lahore bhop lal replied ah came from lahore what be last news there there be nothing new everything be quiet say that most of english will soon march away will make short work of maharanee son a soon a go man said savagely be puppet now in hand of english have signed away best doab in punjaub so a to buy protection for dhuleep singh be no longer sikh prince will speedily place one of own sirdar on throne be what mean to do bhop lal agreed want boy a ruler now sirdar who can lead to battle will be different next time last time despised english so beat next time will be who will make too sure will beat where be going be thinking of taking service under ghoolab singh old fox be traitor man said angrily while general murmur broke from comrade there be doubt that played false bhop lal agreed now that be master of cashmere may think interest to go with next time besides at present gold be a good a none of other sirdar will increase force until english have retired so there be just choice of taking service with ghoolab of starving there be occasion to starve for who have got arm man said find easier to help ourselves to be own master than to serve anyone else have better join comrade thank have thought over may be sure have have enough of marching about sleeping in air for present be likely at rate to sleep eat meal in peace with ghoolab there be little chance of rising for long time yet till then at rate there will be peace in cashmere when fighting begin again here have made up mind to come back if find ghoolab have forgotten that be sikh now with permission will be riding on bhop lal turned horse with companion trotted off got through well enough percy remarked did not think be worth robbing sahib a be well armed must not have be worth while to meddle with besides see horse be on other side of grove must have noticed that be well mounted must have got long start before be off be a likely a not that did not believe story thought be on way to join other band knew of have fear of fellow if meet openly in daytime danger will be if come upon suddenly attack

party consisted of twenty cart laden with merchandise escorted by thirty men armed to teeth see get employment way sahib akram chunder remarked of make money by turning robber others make money by selling service to merchant to protect good from robber doubt cart be on way down from serinagur jummoo be laden with shawl embroidery such other good a merchant think english officer at lahore will be glad to buy to send home to friend must think will make good venture percy said for bazaar at lahore be very poorly stocked trade have be bad there for long time owing to trouble disturbance hear that many of trader who have remained fled when news came of defeat at sobraon fearing that english army must act a sikh must have done under circumstance must march straight to lahore plunder city

lal agreed heartily have be soldier have be peasant too know where shoe pinch perhaps thing will be better now man shrugged shoulder see not how be to be said lahore durbar be under protection of foreigner one heed a have power save in city better thousand time prince who can make obeyed even be ghoolab singh else strong foreign rule must rather have native prince far better than nominal rule of boy protected by foreign bayonet must be rule of foreigner for at least can make law respected punish ill doer preserve peace order fancy there be great many who think a do bhop lal said for most part keep thought to well will see what will see thing will never go on long a be at present a say punjaub will either be ruled by strong native prince will like scinde become possession of english have have enough of fighting mean to remain quiet until one other of thing come about there be many like of soldier who come through say must like to fight english again then take word for soldier

two hundred disbanded soldier lurking among wood bush between next town sirdar lal mizrah moved by complaint of country people cleared road of few day since breaking up party killing many therefore at present be more cautious be how convoy got through safely yesterday must advise therefore to travel by country road though even be not safe for robber finding that people have deserted main road have taken to path have beset also have nothing to lose life bhop lal said a be somewhat precious to will take care can to avoid gentry speak of after consultation with percy be agreed that a time be particular object must strike off at once to west travel for day in direction then make north thereby getting well out of line followed by traveller from lahore after having be through three battle percy said must be folly to risk getting throat cut merely for sake of saving day journey accordingly next morning took route passed several village in course of day a be seen approaching men woman ran into house closed door not soul be to be seen in street a passed through need not have be afraid of being questioned percy said be evident that whole population of country be scared by exaction of disbanded soldier that be only too glad to see pas by without interfering with must have be well for country if sutlej have risen foot on day of storming of sobraon must have relieved country of thousand more of plunderer met with adventure until arrived within few mile of fortress then a be riding along through wood party of men on foot suddenly sprang out from among tree before have time to

party of men lying in ambush here to capture lad a came up two year ago everyone know be doing that place be besieged three month since must not be a well to give fellow stab leave here man who have recognized akram chunder asked not at leader said harshly at rate not at present may find useful if want to send messenger in to white colonel besides if ransom boy to uncle be use setting against by killing servant even if colonel agreed to leave unmolested of men might take matter up make country too hot for be always against killing unless there be something to be gained by see nothing to be gained by fellow death percy have be stunned by blow from heavy cudgel struck off horse heard latter part of conversation knew that resistance must be fatal submitted quietly to be placed on horse hand be first bound in front of rein be then cut two horseman one on side of took end akram chunder be similarly treated surrounded by whole party numbering about twenty rode off by dress attire judged men into whose hand have fallen be not discharged soldier regular dacoit when heard one of address leader by name of goolam tej recognized a of dacoit who have for year be scourge to part of country although have seldom ventured to molest village in colonel district knowing how speedy relentless must be pursuit have heard numberless story of atrocity committed by band how have tortured men woman to force to reveal hiding place of money how have slaughtered not only who ventured to offer resistance wife family however have fear a to own safety there be nothing to be made by killing while there might be large sum to be obtained a ransom from uncle by sale to ghoolab band be mounted on wiry little pony for hour rode at rapid pace halted in wood at foot of hill here leader upon asking question whether of have ascertained beyond possibility of doubt that man have left behind be dead be furious at finding that none of have done so men who have stripped declared felt quite certain of have dozen wound one of must have killed one of said that being so did not think of putting hand on heart to feel if beat make easy goolam tej fellow be dead beyond doubt there be never saying leader replied men be so tough that get over wound must have be sufficient to kill dozen time be always well to make sure by stroke with dagger through heart by cutting off head there be great trouble about job prevents mistake occurring if determine on sending to ghoolab singh first want colonel to know what have happened till be at other end of country if fellow must be found on road wound bound up may recover so far a to tell have happened then will have colonel scouring whole country with force besides may send to lahore lay complaint before durbar a boy be english must get up hue cry after through whole of punjaub daresay man be dead still there ought not to be possibility of doubt about blame a much a do for not having given thought to matter on dismounting percy leg be firmly bound be laid down on ground at short distance from follower dacoit with gun sword taking seat by of so that even conversation be impossible next morning started up hill after hour riding crossed crest then leaving bridle path by have travelled dismounted led horse along steep face of hill until reached perpendicular crag standing out from upon summit of stood castellated building long shed have be erected upon comparatively flat piece of ground among tree at foot into dacoit led pony then mounted path few inch wide cut in rock leading up to strong door gave access to building watchman on wall have seen coming a entered be greeted with cry of joy by number of woman percy saw at once that building be ancient that have recently be roughly repaired doubted not that be deserted fortalice that band have occupied made head quarter during day ride dacoit have taken precaution of bandaging eye of prisoner only unloosened wrap when on nearing place ground have become so steep difficult that be necessary for to have use of eye prisoner be taken to small room in little tower at one of angle of building cord be then unloosened be left alone together be nice fix that be in akram chunder percy said be indeed sahib care not so much for to think that after going through battle must be seized by robber within few mile of home cut to heart be awfully sorry for bhop lal percy said do think be killed that can not say not having seen wound if be not in vital place may live through for be a hard a piece of iron be not given to drink men who drink have little chance of making good recovery must have sense know to lie still sham dead hope ere may have carried news to uncle must obtain help assistance from first passer by when told story for there be not peasant in district who doe not love colonel chapter xii prisoner percy went to window looked out there be three of mere arrow slit from of have view of wood stretching away down hillside into narrow valley short distance down took turn hill cut off further view where be think akram chunder have idea sahib beyond fact that by position of sun be looking eastward must say place where halted yesterday be thirty mile to north east of fortress may have be more certainly be not le must have known country to day be mounting time till last hour then must feel that descended sharply must say that be six hour on horseback travelled part of way at trot more often walked so at five mile hour must be thirty from camp of last night if travelled straight to east time may have crossed main crest of hill if not may be anywhere among for tied bandage so carefully over eye must see nothing not even road under horse foot must not have helped much have done so percy said with laugh one road be good deal like shadow must have shown direction in be travelling sahib more accurately than must tell by heat of sun so must akram did not think of at rate may take that be in very out of way spot where must be difficult for anyone to find without guide be so sahib can see nothing tree sign of human handiwork place must not be seen at great distance for doe not rise very much above top of tree rock be about thirty foot high where mounted though must be well nigh double on lower face building be not great height though must be seen well enough from that valley down there must not be made out from above even from hillside be scarcely visible must be difficult place to capture except by force provided with cannon for occupies whole of top of crag a far a must see be quite unclimbable except by path up mounted above gate there be projecting turret loophole of at corner commanded dozen men with musket ought to be able to hold that path against number for even if got up to gate noticed a entered that there be hole in floor of turret above by must fire down pour hot lead on head of trying to break open gate heard what said about ransom heard sahib only hope that will go direct to colonel be afraid will try ghoolab singh first know that have plenty of money in treasure chest be afraid so too akram fact that ghoolab tried to catch before show that think must work upon uncle through a seems to have set mind upon obtaining possession of fortress must think must pay sum scoundrel elected to ask man nodded will pay anything sahib be not only that want place that owes colonel grudge for having held so stoutly in spite of ghoolab never forgets injury forgives one hate see chance of making escape percy said again examining window none sahib rat must hardly creep through loophole have mean to cut away stone must be nearer escape unless have also rope that long one for be at lower angle of rock must say loophole must be eighty foot above ground have nothing to make rope of a see have stripped to cumberband have taken away coat so clothes if torn up twisted together must scarce make rope eighty foot long must support own weight see shadow of chance of escape way in way if guard be vigilant may have better chance if be taken to ghoolab must not have at jummoo for must complaint be laid against on account must of course deny that know aught about wherever be taken will probably find better chance of escape than there be here once free might manage be not likely that of dacoit can know be from cashmere may be sure will not let find out that speak language if must get out then must pas a peasant however hot pursuit ought to be able to evade five day passed prisoner have nothing to complain of in treatment being kept well supplied with food be always brought in by two armed men while two others stood at door partly percy guessed to prevent attempt to escape partly to see that held conversation with who brought in food ca trust other akram chunder said know well enough that bribe must offer for assistance to escape must be too much for single dacoit to resist leader be wise not to trust sooner be out of better percy said be heartily tired of looking out of loophole care how soon be on way to cashmere how long will be do think before message can come from ghoolab singh if be at jummoo messenger must be able to go come in five six day sahib will probably be little time before can get interview with ghoolab be fifth day since be brought here if hear nothing to morrow will be that be not there that dacoit have demanded so large sum for that be unwilling to give ghoolab be too fond of money to pay if can help be quite possible that when messenger get there will seize torture until reveals position of place will then send force to capture without necessity of paying for wonder whether dacoit have foreseen that possibility be just sort of thing that ghoolab must delight in hope wo attempt anything of sort percy said if dacoit find surrounded attacked here must likely enough avenge upon by cutting throat before men must force way in be just what must do sahib a ghoolab must foresee risk will hope prevent from carrying out plan will learn from messenger that place can hardly be taken by sudden surprise therefore may think better to pay sum demanded provided be not too large to running risk of losing altogether must not be ill pleased to hear of death for must reckon be out of way sooner later fortress district must fall into hand doubtless must rather have in order that may drive good bargain with colonel get to hand place over in exchange for hope uncle will hing of sort percy said akram chunder shook head be son by adoption said to save life will give up fortress well hope at rate will negotiate for time akram in case will be hard if manage to slip away somehow wish have knife with what for sahib stonework of window be solid must take immense time to enlarge one of loophole so that must slip through be not thinking of if have knife must get off one of back leg of charpoy so that loss must not be noticed cut up into wedge must drive in round door if heard row going on outside door be very strong one if must fasten like inside might not be able to break open before ghoolab men must fight way in be good idea sahib if have knife must carry out without see that must do anything might move two charpoys against door dozen men pushing on other side must soon drive out of way there be nothing to be done percy agreed do hope ghoolab will quite see in event of trying to take place dacoit will be pretty sure to finish before men can get in evening unlashed thin binding held one of bed together armed with one of leg be not much of weapon percy said be something anyhow must be thousand time better to make fight of than to stand still have one throat cut will take by turn to keep awake to night so a to hear if there be anything stirring night however passed without unusual sound being heard just after daybreak heard shout be likely to be messenger returning akram chunder said if have be enemy must have come in dark must not be able to find way percy objected must make messenger act a guide sahib there must be difficulty about besides if have be enemy must have heard other shout whole place must be in turmoil have doubt that be messenger will presently hear what ghoolab say hour passed then door opened men brought in food be to eat quickly one said speaking for first time since have be imprisoned have to mount ride in quarter of hour goolam tej bade tell that have best eat good meal for have long ride before may not get before nightfall when after eating hearty meal percy follower mounted made off escorted by twelve of dacoit congratulated that have escaped danger feared think that life be quite safe now sahib akram said ghoolab singh may threaten will scarcely venture to do harm be always opposed to war with english knowing that must assuredly defeat soldier be far sighted enough to see that ere long punjaub will belong to be true that time sikh might put larger force in field than with last fought so can english for have war lasted two week longer army be coming up from scinde must have joined that fought at sobraon must have well nigh doubled strength being so ghoolab singh who have received kingdom of cashmere at hand of english must fear that did murder one of race trouble must arise when english became master of punjaub in case of uncle must have scruple for a know englishman who take service with native prince do so without consent of government forfeit right to protection besides will be represented that colonel be in fact rebel against durbar since held by force government of have be deprived by order of runjeet singh minister that life be thereby forfeited may not know that have be serving a officer in english army must let hear that governor general have promised appointment in company service have taken great interest in must anything befall will assuredly punish whoever may be author of deed think that if ghoolab have known that must not have accepted dacoit offer before be only relative of man with friend save own soldier have executed publicly a rebel in market place of jummoo there must have be one to gainsay now that be known to governor general commander in chief will see that can not act a will without drawing upon anger of english authority when colonel report fact to there be something in akram not much be asked to explain why have put one of english blood to death must simply reply that be nephew of man who have set government of lahore at defiance have maintained by arm have inflicted heavy loss on force sent to place lawful governor appointed by durbar in power that person executed have taken part in act of rebellion that life be justly forfeited a must be in way true there must really be answer to english must certainly not embroil with powerful prince with whom be anxious to keep on good term on matter still if do see ghoolab will certainly make most of kind expression of sir henry hardinge commander in chief when left at lahore must hardly think however that will see must prefer being able to deny without chance of contradiction that knew anything at about in case sahib how must use a mean of forcing colonel to give up fortress governorship of district must think that most likely will send word to uncle that have learned have fallen into hand of dacoit that if uncle will surrender fortress will take measure to rescue from men who will otherwise put to death colonel will never believe that akram said decidedly will guess at once that be in hand of ghoolab very likely will akram wo be able to prove ghoolab will know well enough that if be to put out of way uncle must not accuse of death a must have evidence of death to produce in support indeed if bhop lal recovered took news of being carried off must say must be confirmation of ghoolab story must show that have indeed be carried off by band of dacoit will most likely be known that goolam tej band be in neighbourhood be doubtless party who attacked akram chunder be silent must not gainsay percy argument seemed to that ghoolab singh have indeed game completely in hand be afraid be a say sahib remarked after while that will have a agreed to slip out of hand somehow see chance at present certainly not percy agreed have arm though have not tied time must be sure that dare not try to escape surrounded a be by for must be able to shoot down before have ridden ten yard moreover wood be too dense for to force way through even if got away at first must be overtaken road be traversing be mere track cut through dense forest be with difficulty that rode two abreast six of dacoit rode ahead of six behind immediately following having a observed when mounted pistol in hand in readiness to shoot at first indication of attempt to escape do think be going towards jummoo percy asked after have ridden for three hour can not say for certain sahib think not feel sure that jummoo lie much to right believe that will come down into valley of cashmere somewhere between serinagur winding about a have be doing in bottom of valley be very difficult to judge way be really going agree with akram have be watching way in sun fall upon a say though have wound turned good deal think have ridden to right a must have done have be making for jummoo doe not make much difference whether be taken there to serinagur percy said end of journey will be prison in case there be doubt about must rather took to serinagur sahib ghoolab singh have be year at jummoo may be sure that in time have built new strong prison from must be very hard to escape serinagur be old place prison must not be like of jummoo ought to be much easier to get out of besides being so much farther from frontier might not watch so closely thinking must know must be next to impossible for men ignorant of language to make way down valley however disguised illustration percy awakes to find that guard be vigilant hour later passed through village a forest thinned a approached path became broader dacoit closed in on side of prisoner completely surrounded inhabitant fled into house a troop rode through halt be made presently came upon broad road following again began to mount day travelled among very lofty hill towards evening made long steep descent think know that last pas went through akram chunder said believe be now descending into valley of cashmere if be right road will fall into ten mile below serinagur shortly afterwards halt be called dacoit turned horse loose to graze proceeded to light fire to cook food have brought with gave prisoner share when meal be concluded tied securely hand foot placed two guard over be relieved at short interval one of men kept fire burning briskly percy woke several time in night time found guard vigilant being convinced that there be possibility of escape while in charge at once went off to sleep again in morning bond be loosed resumed journey about mid day came down into wide flat valley large river meandered with many turn winding down smaller stream fell into at many point be small river for most part navigable percy asked pointing to silver thread among bright green expanse of vegetation yes sahib river be road throughout valley be by that peasant take in product to serinagur say must carry large barge small boat can make way along right up to foot of hill must be very rich country judging from number of village scattered about be sahib with good government cashmere must be paradise be never very hot very cold air be soft balmy soil be so rich that everything grows in abundance with little trouble to cultivator have to gather crop pitch into boat can make way to market without necessity for horse bullock government be bad have be so for long ghoolab be hard master harder than former ruler have be people must be rich contented indeed under rule a of english firm just for in addition to agriculture have many other mean of earning living there be shawl weaver silver worker who paint on lacquer member of family can help to earn something mountain abound with game there be pasturage for countless flock herd poet of india have always sung of cashmere a fairest most blest by nature of spot south of hindoo koosh have not spoken bit too strongly with good ruler must be that much more fault be that country be so fair climate so balmy life so easy that people be too soft in habit to make good soldier country have therefore be overrun countless time by more warlike race at present sikh be master rule be likely to be even shorter than of others who have conquered when english be lord of punjaub will see how fair how rich be valley of cashmere that have to stretch out hand to take will be blessed day indeed for people when do so think want further conquest akram must gladly have left punjaub alone be forced against will into annexing first province beyond sutlej now jalindar next time perhaps rest of country there can be aggression from cashmere sahib same necessity may arise here a elsewhere english hate oppression if ghoolab successor grind down people beyond certain point will interfere moreover cashmere be necessary to through run best road over great northern chain of mountain be quite a much a afghanistan door of india round valley at northern end be troublesome tribe whom ruler of cashmere have never be able to keep in order boundary of china be not far away generation two at outside english will be ruler at serinagur think sahib what blessing must be to country in first place there must be neither over taxation oppression must live till land work loom secure of enjoying earnings in peace money must flow into country for sahib must come in great number from plain for health for sport must spend money freely must buy manufacture from weaver silversmith at first hand while now have to be sent down to market at great expense in troublous time at great risk there see sahib be taking northern road in two hour will be at serinagur better akram be lovely view must be long time before be tired of looking at be eager to see what kind of place be going to be shut up in so a to judge chance of escape wish must get hold of couple of long knife hide somewhere about before reach town for clothes have worn when be captured have be restored to before starting one might persuade one of fellow riding by to part with knife sahib pocket be empty at least mine be suppose have left better provided akram have twenty gold piece wrapped up in flannel stowed away in flap pocket at bottom of holster uncle have made on day left said that might be useful to have small store of money there in case ever fell among thief be so contrived that even if anyone put hand right down to bottom of holster must not suspect that there be pocket there for flap exactly fit make sort of false bottom money be stowed away there have never thought of since must be well hidden sahib akram chunder said with laugh for have put saddle on off hundred time put pistol sometimes food into holster never for moment suspected that there be money lying there be sure that have be taken percy put hand down into holster be all right akram can feel roll of flannel under flap well sahib if can get out four piece be hard if manage to get couple of knife from fellow next to a for rest if can hide about may prove mean of getting free from prison thinking over seemed to that greatest difficulty be that have mean of bribing anyone percy managed to get out four gold piece passed quietly to follower comrade latter said in low voice to dacoit riding beside have two knife in girdle at what do value man looked keenly at prisoner clothing have be searched with scrupulous care felt sure that hiding place must have be overlooked depends on who wanted to buy said cautiously suppose wanted to buy then must be worth two gold piece be beyond mean must not mind giving gold piece for of where be piece to come from be business perhaps have hidden in mouth ear hair dare not do man said might be noticed not if managed well akram said might ride close up to when road happens to be narrow pas in moment besides be not thinking of escape now may be useful to afterwards be too great risk man repeated irresolutely well will give three piece for two though be hard that must beggar man nodded presently akram saw shift two knife to side of girdle next to short distance farther on glanced round at two men riding behind be laughing talking together evidently paying little attention to prisoner moment later touched horse rein knee rubbed against akram latter passed three gold piece into hand snatched knife from girdle thrust under coat dacoit at once drew off to former position riding close together akram have difficulty in passing one of knife to percy who then again opened flap in holster took money from flannel inclosure handed seven piece to akram where do mean to hide asked in fold of waist sash be only place to put at present of course if search will discover money knife will be so sure that dacoit have taken everything from that may not think while to do so if once leave in room alone can hide away so that nothing careful search will find at present must trust to chance be now approaching town extends two mile on side of river jelum across several bridge be thrown percy be disappointed at appearance of place contained building of sufficient importance to tower above rest be most struck with green appearance of roof on remarking to akram latter replied be garden sahib roof be for most part flat be overlaid with deep covering of earth keep house warm in winter cool in summer soil be planted with flower form terrace where family sit in cool of evening explains be pity same thing be not done in other town look wonderfully pretty people passed on road be dressed somewhat differently to of india men wore large turban great woollen vest with wide sleeve while woman be for most part dressed in red gown also with large loose sleeve bound head be red twisted handkerchief over be thrown white veil did not however cover face be language at like punjaubi percy asked sahib differs altogether from indian tongue so far a have heard be therefore very difficult to be learned by native of other part before reaching town horseman turned off from main road making wide detour so a to avoid altogether continued course along foot of hill on left of valley after proceeding two mile above upper end of city mounted hill in hour reached building standing at considerable height above valley be just a expected sahib see have avoided town ghoolab will if questioned be able to affirm that have never be brought there none of people met on road will have noticed dressed a be in middle of band whom will take to be following of sirdar if be to be prison akram doe not look anything like difficult place to get out of a dacoit castle of course depends on where put stopped at entrance to building be evidently expected for officer came out at once followed by six armed men addressed question to dacoit simply nodded a led two prisoner forward two of men took bridle of horse led inside gate be then closed percy akram dismounted officer entering door from court yard ordered in punjaubi to follow to percy great satisfaction led way up staircase instead of a lad have feared might be case down one leading into subterranean chamber after ascending twenty step went along narrow passage at end of be strong door studded with nail one of men produced key opened on entering percy found in chamber fifteen foot square be not uncomfortably furnished have two native bedstead floor be covered with rug low table stood in centre there be two low wooden stool near percy first glance however be towards window be of good size reached to within foot from floor be however closed by double grating of strong iron bar with opening of four five inch square fear harm be intended officer said for time must make yourselves a comfortable a can here servant will be allowed to be with if there be anything require will be supplied to so saying left room door be then locked thank goodness be left with akram percy exclaimed thing have be dreading most of be that must be separated if have be so must have lost hope of escape have feared that too sahib though did not speak of before think of anything farther let hide one of knife money in bed why not hide percy asked because might be moved suddenly sahib ghoolab might order to be taken to prison might send for down to jummoo there be never saying so be well to keep of money about of course may be searched in case must lose however think will do now will make quite sure that dacoit will have taken everything there be to take chapter xiii escape having carefully hidden one of knife nine piece of gold in bed divided remaining eight piece between akram took off turban unrolled hair hid four piece in then with point of knife unripped two three stitch in lining of percy coat dropped money into hole how about knife akram be much harder thing to hide must be hidden on sahib so that if be separated will be able to use if see opportunity took knife with cut off strip inch wide from cloak then pulled up one of leg of percy long sikh trouser with strip of cloth strapped knife tightly against side of shin bone handle came close up to knee point extended nearly to ankle bone there be fear of shifting said when have fastened bandage pulled leg of trouser down again even if felt over might well omit to pas hand over leg below knee be certainly capital hiding place akram must never have thought of putting there be last place must think of searching for anything now can have look at window be very strongly grated akram shook head there be getting through there sahib bar have not be up many year stonework be perfect with only knife must be absolutely impossible to cut through double grating room have doubtless be meant for someone whom wanted to hold fast yet to treat respectfully may give up idea of escaping through window that stonework be evidently put up at same time a grating see rest of wall be of brick see akram be covered with white plaster yes sahib house here be built of brick be to say of brick woodwork noticed one be also besides if look at plaster carefully can make out line of course of brick underneath be thin coat badly laid on be nuisance be there percy remarked if have be for might have be possible with knife to have cut away mortar between brick so have got out one by one till made hole big enough to get through of course must be long job by replacing brick carefully in place working at night might have be managed white plaster render quite impossible unless whole thing must be done in one night must be out of question there be floor must examine that presently have read of escape from prison by men who managed to raise flooring stone made hole underneath big enough to work in so made way into room through outside wall must need time patience hard work unless be able to bribe man who brings in food be how must be done pushed aside one of rug floor be composed of smooth slab of stone about foot square must not be better said there must be great difficulty in getting up couple of slab be fitted pretty closely ought to be able to find one where there be room for blade of knife to get in between next to be good sahib must never have thought of getting out way however if tell what to do will do akram went to place where have hidden knife there be hurry akram can fix on stone while there be daylight ca begin until be sure that everyone be asleep may bring in food at moment before begin in earnest will have to find out hour at visit how late come in at night at moment heard step coming along passage sit down on stool percy said while threw down on one of charpoys must look a dull stupid a can man brought in dish of boiled rice meat akram addressed in punjaubi shook head went out without word if none of fellow speak anything own language sahib will be difficult to try get to help for will not do to let out that can talk language for if once get free will be best hope of getting through country will try other way first at rate akram money have be not sufficient to induce man to risk life in assisting might possibly think must do better by betraying in case might be separated put in much worse place than be true enough sahib at same time money have be very large amount here must not get above three four rupee month so that must be four five year pay still there be danger of betraying a say have better try in first place to get out a propose be nothing to what men have done sometimes akram have escaped through wall of solid stone build like here brick be not generally well baked be often only sun dried a soon a have finished food will examine stone will begin near outside wall might get into inhabited room if went other way working towards outside know have only to get through to be free for rug will make rope by can slide down without difficulty examining flag along side of outer wall found two three where without much difficulty must insert knife in interstice let set to work at once akram can hear man footstep right along passage will have plenty of time to drop stone in throw rug over before reach door want to see what be underneath specially want to have place to hide two knife in case must take into head to search cement in flat slab be laid be by mean hard in hour have cut round one of stone be however still firmly attached to cement below be afraid to use pressure akram for might break knife be so sahib if have iron bar might break stone see other way of loosening perhaps if be to jump upon might shake think there must be much chance of if there be anyone in room below might come up to see what be doing might fill crack with water round by pouring in more water from time to time might soak in soften cement of course that depends entirely upon quality however might a well do at once filled crack with water drew rug over place then returned to seat presently akram said might try wedge sahib so might did not think of there be bed of course yes must cut away piece from under part of framework of one of bed will do capitally be slow work cutting out piece of bamboo sufficiently large to make couple of dozen of wedge be dark long before akram have finished took three hour to split up make into wedge a soon a be completed drove in close to other along one side of stone pressing in with haft of knife with united weight when be wedged in akram tried stone be a firm a ever sahib yes did not expect that must be able to move especially a have not hammered in wedge if doe not move by morning must tap in giving tap four five minute must not be noticed hope will find be loose then see crack be full of water so wedge will swell exercise tremendous pressure in place split stone like that threw down on bed slept till morning broke percy be first to open eye at once leapt up ran across room moved rug examined stone have moved akram side opposite wedge be jammed hard up against next stone be a firm a ever sahib akram said trying with knife yes because be held by pressure of wedge when get out will find that be loose from cement found however that there be possibility of getting out strip of wood have only to wait percy said a soon a be dry will be loose be however two day before moisture have evaporated sufficiently for to be able to draw out wedge now let put knife in on side try lift repeated trial showed that must not be done in evening however when lamp be brought heated point of one of knife in flame until have so far lost temper that be able to bend point over by pressing on one of flag again heating dipped in water to harden then ground point down on one of stone until be able to pas down joint that action of wedge have widened bent point caught under stone have difficulty in raising there be first step done percy exclaimed in delight have better warm knife straighten point again experienced great difficulty in getting up next stone have loosened in similar way to first while waiting for wedge to dry a soon a be up began cutting into cement surface be hard knife at first did little more than scratch below found much softer got on more rapidly a removed cement placed powder handful at time on window sill blew gradually out through grating after three night of continuous work have made hole foot deep come down upon wooden planking be doubtless ceiling of room underneath percy said there can be one sleeping there must have heard scratching overhead by lifting up stone always replaced at daybreak must hear voice did not recommence work at night till be well assured that one be stirring below a stone have taken out be next to wall now commenced operation on brickwork found much easier a mortar be nothing like so hard a cement on cutting out between brick have great difficulty in moving after two night work have taken out with exception of outside layer a be able to calculate by thickness of wall at window during daytime brick have be removed be stowed away in hole will be out to night percy said exultantly a replaced flag for last time last layer will be easy work for a soon a have cut round one brick will be able to pull in can then get hand through hole others will come quite easily a soon a cut away mortar bit there will be occasion to tear up rug to make rope be not more than eighteen twenty foot from ground two three of knotted together will be enough will set one of bed over hole tie end to percy felt nervous day being in fear time heard footstep in passage that something might occur must upset plan have now be ten day in prison so there be time for messenger to have gone to jummoo thence to fortress back still hoped that uncle must at rate refuse to accept ghoolab singh first offer might be lengthy negotiation must go on nothing out of ordinary routine happened guard came three time day a usual with food after last visit percy sprang from couch hurrah next time come will find place empty akram now let set to work at once four hour of hard work sufficed to make hole large enough for to crawl through charpoy be brought over hole money stowed away in clothes rug knotted then foot foremost percy wriggled out through hole holding rope tightly slid down to ground while two minute later akram stood beside have already taken off turban rewound much more loosely so a to resemble closely worn in cashmere started at once up hill continued course until reached wood high up on mountain side have already determined upon course be of greatest importance that must obtain dress of country for though might have made way along hill must have difficulty in buying food might find horseman already posted at various pass by mountain range be traversed at daybreak akram took off long coat arranged clothes in fashion of cashmere peasant started boldly for town shop will soon be open said unless anyone happens to go round to back of prison be not likely will not find out that be gone until man enters at nine o'clock with food long before will be here again need not be uneasy about sahib being really native of valley one can suspect of being anything else soon after eight o'clock returned with two complete suit in be soon attired a native of cashmere be fairer than of plain of india needed slight wash of dye akram have brought up with to convert percy bronzed face to proper tint a soon a be done descended hill came upon main road below city soon afterwards horseman passed galloping at furious rate did not even glance at supposed peasant continued course down valley other much larger body of horseman afterwards passed like first without asking question doubtless think have at least twenty mile start akram said expect first party be going right down to mouth of valley warning town village to be on look out for others when think must have passed will scatter occupy road pass of will push on until almost within sight of fortress so a to catch there if manage to get through wood pas line of watcher at leisurely pace proceeded down valley akram sometimes entering into conversation with peasant met going into shop buying provision learnt in village strict order have be given to watch for sikh with young englishman who have escaped from prison at serinagur akram joined in expression of wonder a to how englishman must have got there how escape have be managed mentioned that be on way to visit relation at jummoo when near mouth of valley purchased cotton cloth such a peasant working in field must wear presently put on left behind have proved so useful percy skin being stained brown wherever exposed by more scanty costume thus attired issued out from mouth of valley went forward into ghoolab singh country a agreed that be place where be least likely to be looked for have be four day on way down from serinagur decided to travel still farther west so a to return to fortress from side opposite to where watch be likely to be kept up for three day more walking having made detour approached fortress on west met with suspicious party on way a ascended zigzag road from valley felt with delight that be now perfectly safe a usual drawbridge be down gate open passed in without question from men on guard there a went down street saw figure recognized percy ran forward exclaimed bhop lal be indeed glad to see so rascally dacoit did not kill after blessed be day sahib bhop lal exclaimed with delight there have be sore grief over colonel have be in terrible state since be carried in here told how have be seized by dacoit still more have be troubled since ten day ago learned from messenger of ghoolab singh that have fallen into clutch of notorious scamp goolam tej ranee be ill keep bed ah akram chunder truly be rejoiced to see also be glad indeed that be with young sahib for knew to be man of resource be young sahib who devised plan by escaped bhop lal how be wound be very sore yet hakim say that will be many week before be fit to sit in saddle again now that sahib be back safely will have more to fret about will mend rapidly by time have arrived at door of colonel residence percy ran in can not enter here fellow servant said a be about to push aside hanging of entrance to private apartment percy laughed without waiting to explain pushed man aside ran in well uncle here be exclaimed a entered room where uncle be sitting writing latter leapt to foot with cry of joy why percy be in disguise welcome back boy thousand time before tell anything come in to see mahtab who have be downright ill from grief since bhop lal brought in news of being carried off by dacoit ranee delight at seeing percy be unbounded be time before husband must sit down quietly listen to story be well that end well colonel said when have brought to conclusion have have bad time of percy doubt if aunt have not have worse of course be good deal troubled when heard that be carried off a to bhop lal must tell nothing having be shot down at once so hacked that knew nothing of what took place until be revived by water being poured down throat three trader coming along road on way here have found a soon a learned from who be what have occurred bandaged wound have carried here in dhoolie reported that have seen nothing of one of at once rode back with with troop of horse to spot where have found man a after most careful search must find trace of blood concluded that have be carried off followed trace of band for distance then lost just a be becoming dark a have have eight hour start of be making for mountain gave up pursuit returned here made sure in morning must receive message from rascal demanding ransom for a day went on became more uneasy a idea struck that might not be dacoit fellow in pay of ghoolab certainly did not seem likely that must have heard that must be on way back men might have be there for week for must guess that when war be over must be making way back here again for next six day sent out party of horseman over country must obtain news whatever be getting in terrible state of mind when man rode in with letter from ghoolab singh stated that have learned that be in power of dacoit somewhere among mountain said that must be long difficult task to find that must use effort to do so must either by force bribery obtain restore if on part must undertake to resign government held in defiance of order of durbar a rebel felt that must not be justified in exerting on behalf if must submit to order of durbar must guarantee that past conduct must be overlooked that must be restored to have very little doubt that be already in scoundrel hand when sent message in case saw that have on hip suppose expected direct answer to proposal did not get one sent answer back be ready to pay reasonable sum for ransom a for resigning governorship handing over fortress wished to know what guarantee must offer must be permitted to retire from punjaub in safety with family treasure to received answer that be ready to take most solemn pledge for safety that be sending off to lahore to obtain free pardon for from durbar permission for to retire with family a many of follower a might wish to accompany across sutlej then wrote back that must be perfectly satisfactory that naturally must require that must be handed over to prior to evacuating fortress to received answer thought perhaps be waiting for reply from lahore now understand that before messenger returned with second letter have already slipped through finger must have liked to have seen when received news of escape now percy tell about adventure since left there be believing of report that reached about various battle know of course that sikh must have be thoroughly thrashed must never have have british occupation of lahore beyond really know nothing for certain took time for percy to describe military operation knew that must be so colonel said gleefully when concluded told over over again that if thought because have won victory over afghan other tribe that be match for english be completely mistaken scoffed at idea of defeat now find be right so be old runjeet singh fellow have plenty of courage plenty of dash though good many thousand have be drilled in fashion can not be called soldier have general officer to speak of when came to fighting must be nothing better than mob still fellow must have fought well to turn out of strong intrenchment in open field have doubt whatever a to result behind earthwork discipline doe not go for much brave fellow who be good shot count for nearly a much a trained soldier now may a well get into decent clothes again percy while be doing will go out see man tell be well pleased with conduct that comrade will be well rewarded for danger have passed through in evening percy went more into detail colonel be highly pleased to hear that have attracted attention of head of army that governor general have promised to apply at once for civil appointment for be thinking of doing uncle will hold on percy say there be to be british resident at lahore probably troop will remain there permanently in agree with for be morally certain that if maharanee son be making peace with surrendering jalindar doab must be turned out probably massacred moment troop retired well with english resident there being to great extent under british protection having besides regular army lahore will be glad enough to let alone so there be only ghoolab be not very certain of position yet have doubt know a well a do before long there will be war will end in people annexing whole of punjaub think therefore there be chance of trying again to take place by force may of course daresay will try assassination again will be on guard think uncle there ought to be more care at gate came in without being questioned might for aught guard knew have be two men sent by ghoolab to assassinate think that man coming into place ought to be questioned a to business must lie boy what be use of questioning ah must not let in uncle unless must prove that have business with person living in fort be not recruiting now if be must get plenty of men well known in district say that must keep assassin out whatever mean adopt do think that if be known in district that one be admitted within wall until after have given satisfactory account of ghoolab must find more difficult to get men to undertake so hazardous business a ranee thoroughly agreed with percy colonel consented to make more rigid rule although still maintaining opinion that precaution of sort must be of slightest avail in keeping determined man from entering place next morning horseman came in from ghoolab colonel laughed a read letter have brought old fox still hope to catch again percy simply continues negotiation asks what guarantee can offer on part will retire from fortress if be a demand given up to before surrender will put out of agony so colonel wrote short note to effect that nephew have returned having informed who be brigand into whose hand have fallen there be longer need for further negotiation on subject must be doubly careful now roland ranee said when husband told what lie have written to ghoolab have always be bitter enemy will be more so than ever now do beg that will again have guard have during siege that will have two men who have proved so faithful to percy to sleep always at entrance to apartment hate being guarded colonel said still if will make more comfortable of course will be a wish when officer of garrison understood that ghoolab have again be foiled there be general opinion that too great precaution for colonel safety must hardly be taken watch at gate be carried out most vigilantly for colonel be so much beloved by men that considered personally responsible for safety might be story told by stranger arriving at gate be not allowed to pas until trader other person wished to see be brought down to gate to vouch for truth of statement during next three month seven eight men whose story proved to be false be seized imprisoned officer be in favour of applying torture to to extract truth colonel must not hear of will have one tortured in district thing have never be done to knowledge since be appointed governor ten year ago wo have begun now in second place can not depend in slightest upon anything may be told under torture lastly if knew for certain a think probable that be agent of ghoolab must really be none wiser came here with false

mounted to be possessor of animal like uniting hardiness of native horse with power speed of english sire be unhoped for pleasure expressed thanks in warmest term a be evident that mr agnew must very shortly be leaving for mooltan that therefore speed be necessary percy two men started at daylight next morning rode by long stage down to lahore until last halt before reaching city percy have ridden in native dress a although thing have now settled down good deal feeling be a strong a ever against british who still at earnest request of maharanee durbar maintained force at lahore to support young maharajah authority be therefore advisable to avoid attention until reached capital a soon a arrived there percy rode to residency be glad have come mr grove resident said a be ushered into study must have come down fast indeed told messenger to carry note a quickly a must hardly fancied that must have be down for three day mr agnew start to morrow so be just in time did not mention in letter sir day on must set out came down a rapidly a must in order to catch here if possible at moment gentleman in civilian dress with young officer entered room hesitated on seeing that resident be engaged come in mr agnew sir frederick currie said be mr grove have come down post haste to take up appointment a assistant be very glad that have arrived in time mr grove have learnt good deal about from memorandum handed over to sir frederick by predecessor will be very glad to have assistance be lieutenant anderson of st bombay fusilier who also accompanies will leave sir frederick to work at present talk over matter need not ask if be well mounted went on when be seated in room speed with have come down show be there preparation want to make in way of hiring servant have two excellent men sir be with uncle for many year accompanied through last campaign be thoroughly trustworthy be up to work in way have plenty of courage be fortunate mr grove in getting two such men sikh servant a rule be not to be depended upon especially in trouble with countryman while servant from other part of india be of little use here from ignorance of language do know anything in reference to situation at mooltan nothing sir know of course that moolraj conduct be very doubtful during last campaign that be considered probable must have attacked general napier force coming from scinde have not be too strong to be meddled with know anything more than a know succeeded father a dewan of mooltan in fact of country beyond jhelum in nominally remained neutral there be very little doubt that must have taken part in war have seen opportunity must have joined sikh with man must put in field on condition that when be crushed government must be altogether independent of of lahore passage of general napier army overawed at time have promised to pay to lahore large sum of money in return for confirmation by durbar of succession to father office when once firmly established in declined to pay stipulated amount with army in state of mutiny durbar be unable to compel to do so have paid regular revenue of province accordingly one of first measure of durbar after thing have settled down at end of campaign be to send force against moolraj however completely defeated henry lawrence then acted a mediator matter be arranged on basis moolraj must pay up considerable amount of arrears must for three year from last autumn pay fixed sum annually last november paid visit here expressed to john lawrence who have succeeded brother henry a resident that wished to give up position a dewan of mooltan province reason being that by new arrangement people under government have right of appeal to lahore interfered greatly with power of taxation lawrence recommended not to carry out determination insisted on sending in resignation to durbar at first refused after negotiation be accepted on understanding that must for time remain secret when six month later in beginning of march mr lawrence be about to give up post to sir frederick currie former wrote to moolraj saying that if wished to reconsider resignation have now opportunity of withdrawing upon reply that have not changed mind sir frederick took matter up laid before durbar who have hitherto in accordance with agreement between lawrence moolraj remained in ignorance that latter have persisted in giving in resignation durbar who have doubt be glad enough to be rid of governor whose power ambition rendered very formidable accepted resignation have appointed khan singh in place set out to morrow with for new government take with a escort regiment composed of ghoorkas in sikh pay six hundred strong about same number of lahore sikh cavalry battery of native artillery force a be not of course required for protection on road be intended a garrison for mooltan where for aught know people may view change of governor with disapprobation know mr grove added with smile that governor be not always amenable to order from lahore percy laughed be true sir believe be often case uncle often said must give up governorship a soon a maharajah with power to keep order be firmly seated on throne to have given over when there be law order must have be to have given up life a well a fortress have always recognized authority of durbar in other matter have sent revenue in regularly deducting only actual amount of pay given to troop own pay a governor according to term of appointment by runjeet singh yes be aware that have done so mr agnew said matter be brought up at first durbar attended by one of ghoolab singh party be asked whether must give approval to force being sent against uncle a lawrence strongly protested against civil war when matter be brought before one after other threw weight altogether against project especially at present time when there will be trouble at mooltan indeed majority of durbar be equally opposed to action being taken first upon ground that revenue be punctually paid by colonel grove be much more than must be said for most of other sirdar in second place because fort have already repulsed attack by fifteen thousand of regular a call khalsa troop with great loss that attempt might prove equally disastrous at bottom think real reason for opposition to proposal be that be uncle to be succeeded by ghoolab singh son district must virtually become part of cashmere ghoolab power be already much too great threatening from instruction left by two lawrence for guidance of successor know that upon ground alone if upon other opposed operation must tend to increase ghoolab singh dangerous authority at what time do mount to morrow mr agnew mount at party with servant baggage will go down river in boat troop will march will join other at eedgah mile so from fort of mooltan there will be boat for one for servant baggage flat for horse will be much more pleasant sir than march through heat enjoyed journey up from calcutta by water very much indeed journey be performed by easy stage a rate of travel by boat have to be timed by of troop on th of april arrived at eedgah spacious mohammedan building round troop have already pitched camp upon journey percy have be able to be of considerable service to party in communication with native at various point at stopped mr agnew lieutenant anderson have knowledge of language be unable to converse with anything like facility that have attained mr agnew have with several moonshis to translate for to act a clerk conversation in boat have naturally turned upon subject of moolraj probable course be wholly unable to understand mr agnew said first time matter be discussed what man object be in resigning governorship be of course le profitable than be owing in first place to certain district being taken from jurisdiction in second because right of appeal to lahore by person who consider oppressed render impossible for to carry exaction to so great extent a before have moolraj be peace loving man must understand resigning office considered no longer profitable be ambitious one have always be credited with desire intention of one day making independent of lahore just a ghoolab have done natural course must have be to announce that must not afford to pay so heavy sum annually to declare that if pressed must defend especially a on last occasion defeated troop sent from lahore resignation mean annihilation of hope descent from rank of dewan to of sirdar of great consideration conduct be entire mystery to be very last thing one must have expected from man of character if have only be decided in moment of irritation must have understood be six month since first sent in resignation have again again have opportunity of withdrawing have persisted in resigning what do think khan singh can understand no more than can sahib new dewan replied see what design must have in thus maintaining resignation if did not intend to carry out be point mr agnew said thoughtfully if wanted to raise flag of rebellion must have done so at time for say that troop be well paid devoted to if never meant along to resign lieutenant anderson remarked seems to that must only have pretended to do so in hope that durbar must send considerable force with successor yet something le than army in case might have surprised destroyed thus have scored material moral success to begin with must scarcely have calculated upon successor being accompanied by three british officer doe seem feasible explanation anderson doubt in case coming up with twelve hundred troop battery will have altogether destroyed calculation for although might feel strong enough to defy lahore now that resource of government be so diminished must never be mad enough to think that must oppose with remotest hope of success power of england upon morning after arrival at eedgah moolraj rode in with small party of officer have interview with mr agnew expressed satisfaction that successor have arrived that must now be relieved of government be burdensome to said that must return in afternoon when must inform of arrangement have made for handing over fort on following morning promise fulfilled arrangement be then completed for fort to be transferred to khan singh early next morning moolraj saying that must be present to see that matter went off smoothly that evening when percy went to room found two men waiting for there what be sitting up for asked know never want after dinner wanted to speak to sahib bhop lal said be true that fort be to be handed over to morrow morning to khan singh be quite true bhop lal arrangement have be made with moolraj afternoon will go into fort with khan singh sahib mr agnew lieutenant anderson be going with a there be arrangement to be made for purchase of provision for troop other matter mr agnew asked to remain here be comfort indeed sahib why so do think there be going to be trouble know that there will be trouble to morrow sahib can not say what plan of moolraj be there be going to be trouble told morning to try find out sentiment of people so dressed a peasant went boldly into town everyone there think there will be fighting say troop will never accept khan singh a dewan instead of moolraj budmashes of city seem to be of same opinion be not say going to submit like people of lahore to be governed by man who be servant of feringhees what will do know place be in uproar greatly fear there will be trouble now that know be going to remain here will no longer be anxious ghoorkas gun can defend place if sikh cavalry go over at rate will have sheik own horse saddled in readiness for fighting flight next morning a soon a mr agnew be up percy went to told what have learned from bhop lal officer however made light of be of course to be expected mr grove soldier may grumble when leader who have paid fed well be removed one must not take grumbling in earnest a soon a learn that will not be disbanded that new dewan will take into service will treat well liberally will soon be contented enough a to rabble of town doubt must be ready enough for mischief providing troop be with a soon a learn that fort have be handed over that troop have accepted khan singh a dewan will know better than to give trouble moolraj be going with to fort influence will easily bring troop to better frame of mind percy have so much confidence in bhop lal latter be so evidently convinced there be danger of serious trouble that by mean shared mr agnew sanguine anticipation that must pas off well felt however that must be altogether out of place for newly joined assistant to urge opinion against of mr agnew therefore merely bowed said very well sir hope that will go off well that anticipation a to troop accepting khan singh will be realized hour later moolraj with number of officer rode up to eedgah mr agnew lieutenant anderson khan singh mounted started with two company of ghoorkas who be to be placed in possession of fort still feeling extremely uneasy percy first looked to priming of pistol placed sword in readiness near table at be sitting then proceeded to interview native who came in offering to furnish supply of grain forage other provision hour half elapsed then akram chunder came in be anything matter akram know sahib have be on roof of house looking towards fort seemed to hour since there be sudden confusion at bridge over ditch there be number of men gathered round there directly afterwards saw group of horseman think moolraj officer gallop away towards city then presently saw elephant with few footman coming way sign of white sahib elephant be coming hither can see by trapping that belongs to person of importance will call troop under arm sahib ca do until know something definite a likely a not will refuse to take order from besides there can be no danger from elephant handful of footman if be well mr agnew must naturally be very indignant at interference putting pistol in coat pocket taking sword in hand percy went to door elephant be now two three hundred yard distant native who have run on ahead be close at hand master rung ram brother of dewan moolraj sends greeting white officer be badly hurt be bringing hither khan singh have bound up wound a brought along in howdah percy at once called servant to door then hurried forward to meet coming party anxious to discover officer be that have be wounded when came up with saw mr agnew supported in seat by rung ram khan singh be conscious leaning forward said to percy order troop under arm at once mr grove percy hurried away to camp in two minute trumpet be calling to arm men hurrying out from tent surprised at sudden summons a soon a saw that troop be falling in percy returned to house mr agnew have be carried into room laid on couch be right mr grove regret did not treat warning gave a one of importance sit down please take pen paper must send off despatch at once to sir frederick currie be too weak to talk much will learn what have happened from despatch dictate to percy be about to begin when bhop lal entered there be party of ghoorkas carrying litter approaching sahib go out at once mr grove see if be anderson be bringing in did not know what have become of be most anxious concerning fate horse be ready sahib bhop lal said a percy hurried out bring round at once mount own ride with party be still half way between fort eedgah when percy started dashing forward at full gallop be soon alongside lieutenant anderson be lying motionless on litter illustration be dead percy asked a reined up horse be dead percy asked a reined up horse sahib be insensible from loss of blood heart beat how did happen percy asked native officer in command of party have just placed sentry at gate when a two officer rode over bridge one of moolraj soldier who be standing on rushed at sahib agnew knocked off horse with spear then struck twice with sword then trooper of escort who be riding behind spurred horse forward against sahib assailant knocked into ditch lieutenant anderson raised sahib agnew moolraj who be riding by pushed on across bridge forcing horse through crowd rode away sirdar on elephant then came forward sahib be lifted into howdah khan singh got off horse also mounted with sirdar mr agnew seemed to that be over men who have piled arm have run to when cried out directly afterwards of moolraj own party rushed at lieutenant anderson a be remounting horse cut down then rode off crowd dispersed fearing doubt that men who now crowded wall must fire on did not do have one to give order feared that if fired might make matter worse so when place be clear went out with party finding that white officer still lived thought best to bring here at once while native officer have be telling story party with dhooly have continued way percy rode forward at full speed to acquaint mr agnew with what have happened order that everything possible will be done for mr agnew said when have made report go on with despatch moment be of importance will tell happened first can then tell rest a have heard for know nothing about mr agnew then dictated first part of despatch saying that have entered fort with moolraj khan singh former have handed over key to ghoorkas have taken possession have replaced mooltan sentry seeing that moolraj soldier looked sullen discontented mr agnew addressed telling that must not lose by change of governor that service must be retained on same term a before then thinking by manner that have allayed discontent have ridden out of fort be conscious of receiving heavy blow knocked from seat remembered nothing more until found in howdah on elephant with rung ram who have be introduced to a moolraj brother in law bandaging up wound when percy have written native officer report of affair mr agnew dictated earnest appeal to resident to send forward troop with possible speed a be likely must be besieged in building certainly must not hold out for many day against whole force at mooltan letter be at once sent off be then dictated to lieutenant edwardes young political officer who have with sikh force of twelve company of infantry three hundred fifty trooper two cannon two camel gun be on other side of indus be occupied in settling country collecting revenue lieutenant edwardes be urged to advance immediately with speed to assistance letter also despatched mr agnew dictated letter to moolraj calling upon to prove that be innocent of complicity in attack by at once arresting criminal coming in in person to eedgah at time moolraj received letter be presiding over council while garrison be composed of afghan hindu sikh be taking oath of allegiance to briefly replied to mr agnew letter saying that must not comply with request for garrison of fort be in rebellion british officer have better look to own safety on following evening strong body of moolraj cavalry swept down carried off whole of baggage animal of force troop offering active opposition a with loss of baggage animal there be possibility of column retiring force be called into building ordered to prepare to repel attack mr agnew be now so far recovered a to be able to get up to issue necessary instruction to native officer thing look very bad sahib bhop lal said a comrade came into percy room when went in with intention of snatching few hour sleep a have be up whole night before with lieutenant anderson think will not be able to defend until help come percy asked there will be defence at sahib there have be men day in camp moving about under pretence of selling thing really a messenger from moolraj officer calling upon men not to fire upon brother to join who be resolved to fight to death against feringhees traitor lahore government who be servant in mooltan sikh mohammedan hindu have united for common cause moreover resistance be said must be vain help must reach eedgah who drew sword in defence of feringhees must be slain be successful bhop lal will see sahib that not shot will be fired when moolraj advance against place percy went down again to mr agnew told what have heard can not doubt what tell mr grove man information proved right before in case there be nothing to be done anderson can scarcely stand be not fit to be out of bed two men with perhaps moonshis seem to be alone to be relied on need not say that resistance even by two three hundred men must be hopeless must entail death of escape a far a anderson be concerned be out of question must not sit horse mile motion must cause wound to burst out bleeding again at once be not to be thought of danger for there can be none moolraj can have object in murdering two defenceless men especially a must know that crime must never be forgiven must involve in desperate war with england at present can assert that attack upon be work of fanatic that regret matter greatly a although determined to free from dictation of lahore have thought of hostility towards british life therefore be perfectly safe see use in waiting to share captivity that may probably have to undergo for time must recommend to mount ride off with two men evening ca do sir percy said bluntly can not desert mr anderson wounded a be be possible too that troop will after prove faithful in case be impossible must leave must be bad beginning indeed of service in company be to run away leave two of wounded officer behind mr be silent for minute can not press point mr grove said gravely for feel be placed a be might disobey instruction stay therefore if will give stringent order will write down hand to in morning that if troop here mutiny surrender place to moolraj be if possible to effect escape carry news at full speed to lieutenant edwardes if march on alone ignorant of what have happened here will be met overwhelmed by whole of moolraj force be even probable that troop when hear that here have fraternized with enemy may also go over in body whether do so not be of highest importance that must warn lieutenant edwardes of treachery of troop here will put down in writing in morning rely upon to carry out order can do possible good to by staying must probably indeed do harm a might excite passion of mooltan men when enter to see one of still uninjured blood once shed might all be killed very well sir if give written order will of course obey indeed acknowledge that view of matter seems to unanswerable destruction of lieutenant edwardes force must be great misfortune for must immensely encourage people here must enable to make preparation for war undisturbed a must be long while before lahore people must get together army capable of capturing mooltan see can not be of use to agree with moolraj will naturally protect treat well a can not wish to bring down vengeance of government of india upon two men be still waiting in percy room when returned to get horse in readiness to mount at moment said have mr agnew order that if troop here join moolraj be to ride at speed to carry news to lieutenant edwardes who be ordered to advance from dera futteh khan to cross ferry at leia where will probably find be ninety mile away horse will carry there must be better to start to night sahib will be hotly pursued if go off in daytime know that percy replied must be risked until be certain that troop here intend to join moolraj can not go very well sahib be order will obey if get fair start there be not many horse in mooltan will be able to overtake be so bhop lal do come up with will probably be able to give good account of will watch by turn to night sahib be possible rascal may intend to surrender place to moolraj before morning chapter xv news of massacre night of th of april passed off quietly in morning gun of fort opened fire against eedgah single shot only be fired in reply by battery of garrison then whole of artilleryman quitted gun fort continued to fire for time distance be too great for damage to be done fire presently ceased mr agnew percy went to gunner exhorted to return to duty men listened in sullen silence gradually dispersed in short time began to leave building in party of two three by mid day garrison have deserted here be order mr grove mr agnew said placing letter in percy hand can use own judgment a to going now waiting until nightfall own opinion be that must be best for to start at once know why moolraj delay for must know that will meet with resistance however at night place may be surrounded might have more difficulty in getting off in next place a be ignorant of country might miss way lose much precious time lastly hour be of consequence to edwardes even now emissary from mooltan may be at work among troop have mentioned in order a troop here have refused to fire be deserting in great number be evident that moolraj can enter whenever chooses a be of paramount importance to warn lieutenant edwardes to arrest march have ordered to start immediately a have expressed willingness to undertake service although be undoubtedly one of great danger have said that own wish must have led to remain here with anderson to share fate whatever might be that have yielded to anxiety that lieutenant edwardes must be warned have also inclosed note to edwardes saying that service will be at disposal until receive order from resident will start at once sir a think best percy said much moved at thoughtful kindness of wounded officer there be little doubt will get through safely be splendidly mounted men have also very good horse trust sir that will ere long meet again hope so confidently mr grove be evidently be interest to treat well even if keep a hostage can not think there be danger good bye lad safe ride to percy then went in said good bye to lieutenant anderson with heavy heart went out to men be ready to start said get horse to back entrance without attracting more notice than can help fellow might oppose leaving will follow in minute two join at gate there be many more of about there sahib than there be at main entrance be slinking away by score think that there be even sentry on guard at end if bring horse up here mount akram chunder will mount also lead horse will run forward unbar gate if of fellow standing about interfere with three of will be able to overpower will have pistol in readiness very well perhaps will be best plan see there be very few of about here do fetch up horse at once will get couple of bottle of wine bread for journey percy be at door of court yard again before men came up with horse a did so several of soldier standing about moved forward with scowling face be however unarmed having ostentatiously piled musket when firing ceased percy drew pistol from holster slipped bottle bread into place leapt into saddle stand back men said authoritatively one who interferes with will get bullet in head keep abreast of akram went on lead other horse between bhop lal ran forward ahead to gate began to undo bar several of men loitering near ran to stop a percy akram rode up shrank back from four levelled pistol bhop lal threw gate open leaping on horse rode out together regardless of angry shout pursued will ride quietly for while percy said reining horse into canter when have gone few hundred yard will be within sight of wall of mooltan a ride along between river if be galloping hard may suspect something great point be to get to ferry at beelun before be close to once across can laugh at when have gone mile akram chunder looked back be after sahib there be fifty horseman at least just coming out from behind eedgah added there be four men away to right galloping at top of speed towards mooltan then will quicken pace percy said touching horse with heel have six mile to ride to ferry will gain quarter of mile on if can horse be now put to full speed went along at almost racing pace when abreast of fort of mooltan lay mile away on right must perceive that have sensibly increased lead have gone quarter of mile further when there be boom of heavy cannon ball ploughed up field short distance behind expected that percy said fellow from eedgah have taken news of escape be only wasting shot betting be thousand to one against hitting at distance going pace be six gun be fired none of shot came a near a first have done in twenty minute drew up horse at ferry boat be not there be coming across be within couple of hundred yard of shore do dismount sahib stand by horse akram chunder said will take for native if see may refuse to bring boat up for sound of cannon will have told that something be wrong percy did a follower suggested how slowly come said impatiently there be time sahib must not do to shout to to hurry will dismount lead horse down to water edge if keep close to heel will not be noticed twenty country people got out of boat when touched shore percy men at once led horse on board followed four boatman looked surprised at seeing englishman made remark push off at once bhop lal said be going ashore to get meal one of men replied will not start till have got boat load will go at once bhop lal said drawing pistol will pay a much a whole boat load must do have time to spare a others also drew pistol men sullenly thrust pole into water pushed off have gone le than hundred yard when body of horseman rode furiously down to water edge shouted to to return go on percy said authoritatively if one of hesitates for moment be dead man seeing that boat continued way sowars opened fire with pistol though ball fell round boat distance be too great for accurate shooting in two three minute be altogether beyond range men poling lustily now so a to place out of danger indus be of great width at point water be comparatively willow stream gentle in hour gained opposite shore percy have directed to make for point mile below town of kote instead of ordinary landing place where might have encountered number of people waiting for boat to return a traffic be considerable have on way across met two laden boat a water be willow have to get horse over side fifty yard from shore then having well paid boatman rode to bank cutting across field avoided town altogether struck road mile beyond before leaving river bank saw that there be seven eight loaded boat way over trooper having doubtless seized of country craft to convey across will be three four mile on way before have landed mounted akram chunder said will see more of road be good one for time rode fast then reined in horse proceeded at slower pace have ninety mile in to do percy said must not risk foundering horse have have exercise since left lahore must husband strength trooper be not likely to pursue more than thirty mile from ferry at outside perhaps not that when learn that be keeping distance ahead of will see that have little chance of overtaking will not care about killing horse in hopeless pursuit whenever passed through village went through at regular pace a if in way pressed for time native be doubtless aware of attack on two english officer must hardly know that sikh troop have proved faithless must imagine that white officer two men be riding ahead of force on way to join lieutenant edwardes before leading horse out from stable men have filled bag with grain after riding twenty mile from ferry stopped for two hour under tree on elevated ground where must command view down long straight road two three mile a there be sign of pursuer at end of time felt sure that have given chase up a hopeless therefore continued journey at pace horse must best keep up soon after started

clearly to interest of moolraj not to draw english into quarrel between lahore must protect take good care of sincerely hope so lieutenant edwardes replied moolraj showed very hostile front to when napier passed through with force to join sir hugh gough professed to stand neutral there be doubt must not have be neutral have dared fight besides there be mooltan rabble to deal with agnew must have done better to surrender at once to moolraj directly saw that sikh have turned traitor if put off till night budmashes of mooltan knowing that eedgah be no longer defended may take matter in hand in

village have talk with sikh officer of detachment then turned in again until next morning when a soon a sun be up started with detachment presently joined lieutenant edwardes at latter have occupied town without opposition moolraj governor with small body of troop have with having retired at approach next few day be occupied in throwing up intrenchment round town heard that moolraj be about to cross chenab with five thousand men on way to attack a hoped that van cortlandt regiment with four gun must join before moolraj must arrive lieutenant edwardes determined to maintain position one morning however came with serious face into percy room have terrible news said messenger have just returned one sent with letter to mr agnew telling must be with a soon a possible on way met moolraj force mingling with learned what have happened at mooltan after left by nightfall there remained at eedgah only twelve men native clerk officer servant mr agnew have already sent to moolraj to say that be ready to surrender begging to come in person to take over place whether moolraj delayed purposely in order that work must be finished before arrived be matter of doubt at rate did not come soon after dark mob of ruffian of town with soldier among whom be many of sikh mutineer proceeded to eedgah burst in door with shout of death to feringhees rushed in mr agnew be sitting by bedside of anderson have heard tumult of approaching mob doubtless felt that fate be at hand agnew rose a entered be cut down at once despatched by two three blow then rushed at anderson hacked to piece be terrible indeed percy said much moved at news of death of two gentleman with whom have spent last fortnight do think that moolraj be party to atrocity say that agnew head be taken to in presence with apparent approval treated with indignity certainly rewarded murderer with large present robe of honour also gave present to man who have taken principal part in murder of anderson from own knowledge of moolraj although be doubtless ambitious must say that be weak man without courage resolution think have anything to do with first attack on two officer seeing that harm be done knowing that must be blamed for being really in hand of turbulent soldiery resolved to throw in lot with from moment be like many other timid men when driven to wall in favour of desperate measure must no doubt consider by allowing if did not direct murder of two officer bound soldier more closely to interest a deed must put end to possibility of reconciliation of course sad affair altogether alters position be ready to push forward at hazard until heard from that sikh have mutinied then necessity for speed be at end for be evident that eedgah must be captured day left serious circumstance have occurred that render more than doubtful whether can maintain here one of native officer have just brought document have fallen into hand be address from sikh who deserted at eedgah to men here calling upon to join countryman make common cause against english for punjaub be about to take up arm against feringhees worst of be officer say that from what learns document have be here for last two day have be read by soldier if be case can no longer place slightest reliance upon be desirous of holding on here until last moment for two reason hear that moolraj have sent men over country to enlist pathan be by far most warlike people here will certainly take service with unless take service with for choice perhaps must join because have love of sikh who conquered country so long then a remain here will believe that success of moolraj be not assured not only will get large number of valuable recruit prevent going to mooltan in next place have to pay men enlist to do so must collect a far a possible revenue of district in neighbourhood for money like recruit will go to mooltan if doe not come to so see be of greatest importance must hold on here a long a possible in spite of ugly business of sikh wish must get rid of altogether that until can get together strong force of pathan be impossible percy be greatly struck with energy firmness of young officer edwardes have for past year be acting a political agent in greater part of district between indus foot of mountain have also completely pacified bunnoo most turbulent district inhabited by tribe of afghan race who have for five twenty year successfully resisted effort of sikh to conquer while have so completely gained confidence that at bidding levelled four hundred fort constituted strength of country many of have already sent in offer of service for next two three day there be outward change in position good many afghan be recruited messenger have arrived saying that whole of van cortlandt force be on march to join a have not arrived while moolraj force be provided with eighty gun have approached within day march edwardes deemed that must be imprudent to remain longer when be more than doubtful of fidelity of two third of men accordingly evacuated leia recrossed indus have hardly done so when received news that bulk of enemy army have suddenly changed course marched north therefore directed body of two hundred pathan who have not yet crossed river to remain there four hundred of enemy occupied leia pathan be ordered to retire across river if advanced thinking probable that must not do so a retreat be of thing most distasteful to men of race sent over fifty more men to reinforce enemy did advance pathan defended bank of nullah after time took offensive rushed across nullah fell furiously upon enemy whom utterly routed pursuing long distance retaking possession of leia town however be not retained for edwardes have just received order to undertake operation on eastern side of indus to confine to preventing passage of river by enemy to maintaining order in district therefore marched whole force few mile up river to fort of girang where awaited arrival of general cortlandt with command that officer joined there on th of may with mohammedan regiment of loobdan khan battery of six gun moolraj did not attempt to cross river by th further reinforcement have arrived bringing up edwardes force to about four thousand eight hundred men of whom four thousand be believed to be faithful while eight hundred sikh be known to be disaffected more than have heard from bhawul khan rajah of bhawulpoor state on southern side of river ghara that be ready to move in short time against mooltan from south with assistance lieutenant edwardes felt strong enough to offer to undertake blockade of mooltan for rest of hot season through rain if commissioned to do first step taken however be capture of dera ghazee khan strong place on western bank of indus interrupting communication with bhawulpoor forming strong outlying post to mooltan governorship of place country round have be given by moolraj to one of follower named julal khan belonging to lugharee tribe to great anger of powerful chief kowrah khan personal enemy of julal kowrah at once made submission to british sent son gholam hyder with contingent of men to join general cortlandt who be moving with part of force to besiege town on th of may gholam hyder told general cortlandt that be ready to go on in advance to raise whole of father clan with alone to drive julal khan troop with across river general cortlandt accepted offer though doubting much gholam hyder ability to carry out however young man at once left column with contingent rode rapidly on ahead to father place having obtained latter consent messenger be sent off in direction to call upon tribe to assemble same night desperate attack be made upon town men of lugharee tribe who formed principal part of garrison fought stoutly combat continued without success on side when morning broke gholam hyder khan led men forward with such bravery that after severe hand to hand contest gained complete victory killing number of lugharees among whom be one of chief making prisoner of garrison shut in fort capitulated in few hour on condition of being allowed to cross river unmolested moolraj force moved to koreyshee with intention of crossing by boat retaking town failing in doing of opposing attempt on part of edwardes to cross found that boat have be removed two army remained for over week watching other across wide river kowrah khan son received thanks of sir frederick currie durbar bestowed additional rank upon shortly afterwards joined army with four hundred horseman of tribe who fought gallantly through whole campaign received pay for service at end of war be rewarded by grant of estate pension by time although communication be still uncertain lieutenant edwardes learnt that for present british force must advance against commander in chief felt that in first place confidence must be placed upon sikh who must be source of danger rather than of aid in second must take considerable time to collect army sufficiently large for purpose lastly be considered extremely unadvisable to engage large british force upon arduous operation during hot season rebellion of moolraj be against sikh government durbar at lahore be called upon to take active step to repress later on moolraj must be called to account by british for murder of two officer lahore government have accordingly despatched three column who be to converge upon mooltan blockade town be commanded respectively by rajah sher singh sheik emamoodeen jowahir mull dutt nawab of bhawulpoor troop be to form fourth column to meet others before mooltan three sikh column however made very little progress commander being doubtful what others must do uncertain a to fidelity of troop nawab of bhawulpoor be perfectly ready to do share of business altogether declined to march upon mooltan until saw other column making fair progress in direction lieutenant edwardes on learning of hesitation of three sikh commander again wrote offering to undertake blockade of mooltan with own force in conjunction with of nawab of bhawulpoor have now got rid of sikh regiment have just sent off accompanied by two hundred fifty pathan horseman under general command of pathan chief to garrison fort of mithun kote where be out of way of doing mischief far removed from influence of co religionist at passage of indus at time be difficult hazardous augmented by melting snow on hill be rushing down in mighty river fifteen mile wide be impossible for army to cross in face of other at beginning of june however nawab crossed river advanced towards soojabad having sent pressing request to sir frederick currie edwardes must have permission to co operate with injunction against officer crossing indus be removed to immense satisfaction that of percy by time pathan force have increased to three thousand men while two thousand of same race have joined general cortlandt so that be possible to leave force sufficient to ensure order in district west of indus yet to carry considerable number to reinforce nawab prospect be brighter since pathan officer who have come to leia when edwardes occupied that town under pretence of negotiating on part of moolraj now sent information that pathan officer at mooltan who have from first taken part in attack on eedgah be altogether opposed to war must desert a soon a opportunity offered with men join british slow a nawab advance be alarmed moolraj army be ordered to fall back from indus take post at soojabad edwardes be well informed by spy of movement of enemy broke up camp by river before daylight on th of june before nightfall have conveyed portion of army across wide river in great fleet of boat have collected general cortlandt be to follow with rest next morning for have be joined by so many of chief from bunnoo by zemindars of district that have fear of disturbance breaking out in rear so long at rate a went well at front percy have be very busy during halt at dera ghazee khan in marwilling native levy a arrived acting a lieutenant edwardes mouthpiece paying complimentary visit to chief thanking for loyalty bhop lal have acted a drill instructor to pathan recruit who be formed into company a arrived edwardes must have appointed to command of one of body declined offer saying that although ready to aid at other time in day of battle place be by master side nothing must induce to leave akram chunder not being able to speak pathan language must not be utilized in same way a comrade indeed pathan must hardly have obeyed anyone not of own nationality save englishman therefore continued usual work a percy attendant looking after horse cooking for lieutenant edwardes who took meal together percy be delighted when forward move be at last made lieutenant edwardes have at first thought of attaching to general cortlandt column afterwards decided to take with feeling how great be comfort of having someone with to whom must talk over plan difficulty whose opinion however modestly given came a time went on to regard a valuable when force reached opposite bank of river edwardes learned from cooly who have be forced to assist in carrying enemy baggage be now returning to home that have halted at khangurh be disappointment a showed that be making for soojabad instead of a have hoped for mooltan few hour later received letter saying that two thousand men with four gun have already be sent from mooltan to soojabad order have be issued for two thousand men to march there have nawab shown little more activity must easily have possessed of soojabad in case army of indus must have fallen back to mooltan against town ally must then have marched without opposition whereas moolraj be now concentrating whole force at soojabad be evident that battle must have to be fought there before advancing against next day edwardes anxiety be greatly increased by news that column of jowahir mull dutt be at last approaching leia be in state of disorganization that one of cavalry regiment have deserted joined moolraj fresh proof of general disaffection of sikh be alarming especially a sikh force at bunnoo be composed almost entirely of old soldier who have fought against on sutlej fearing for safety of assistant lieutenant taylor at place sent order to leave bunnoo establish at dera ismail khan chapter xvi seven hour of suspense lieutenant edwardes pressed forward with speed in hope of effecting junction with bhawulpoor force before mooltan army must fall upon unfortunately river jelum intervened between ally have rebel army used expedition must have annihilated bhawulpoor contingent before edwardes joined latter have already made preparation for advance having sent on messenger ahead to collect boat at koreyshee with instruction that ally must avoid battle if possible retire before enemy until joined by on reaching jelum late in evening heard that mooltan force have just arrived at point three mile from camp of ally have established evidently did not intend to attack until next morning have better start at once across river grove see that nawab force be in position to defend if enemy attack before can get across commander be old man a hear from agent peer ibraheem khan hopelessly muddle headed inefficient will find ibraheem thoroughly good reliable officer will aid in way be who have got boat collected in readiness for two three of nawab regiment be commanded by englishman if find that general will hing authorize to take command out of hand to make best disposition can under advice of ibraheem boat be coming up fast will begin to cross at daylight with infantry to aid bhawulpoor men in keeping enemy at bay until cortlandt can get gun across until have to help will be at terrible disadvantage for enemy have at least twelve piece remember to morrow be th of june anniversary of waterloo be good omen for a percy be about to ride down to river bank boat came across stood chatting with lieutenant edwardes until arrived contained messenger from peer ibraheem saying that force must march down to point opposite ferry during night so cover crossing must guide officer lieutenant edwardes said so that can meet army on march messenger said that must do so percy with two men horse took place in boat after two hour ride from other side of river met head of approaching column percy hearing that peer ibraheem be with regiment followed waited till came along then handed pencil note edwardes have given repeating to peer ibraheem instruction have already given percy be very glad that have come sahib officer said futteh muhommud pay attention to what be going on be in fact no better than idiot received authority from edwardes sahib yesterday to supersede if be absolutely necessary might possibly cause discontent among troop be better to leave in nominal command morning be breaking when approached river when mile distant met three thousand of pathan who with fifty mounted chief have effected passage during night under command of foujdar khan capable energetic native officer who acted a edwardes adjutant general halt be ordered percy peer ibraheem tried to get men into line to remedy tremendous confusion prevailed baggage animal waggon elephant gun being mixed up in column there be more occasion for haste a rising sun showed enemy marching towards object have evidently be to take possession of ferry thus separate two allied force night march of bhawulpoor men passage of pathan have forestalled at once took up position on salt hill of village of noonar gun in few minute opened two three of nawab gun be with greatest difficulty extricated from confused mass returned fire of enemy bhawulpoor men uttering a be custom before fighting name of rajah in sonorous shout rushed headlong without order regularity against enemy in vain percy peer ibraheem own officer shouted to to stand ground went forward at run until be checked by volley of musketry from traitorous sikh troop while gun swept with grape though accustomed to irregular warfare nawab troop be new to fighting disciplined soldier confounded at storm of lead shot to be exposed fell back in disorder at time lieutenant edwardes who have crossed river in small boat arrived upon spot found most utter confusion prevailing excitement have apparently dissipated remains of sense in futteh muhommud brain old man be sitting under tree counting bead apathetically while group of officer be standing round vainly endeavouring to recall shattered sens to get to issue order lieutenant edwardes at once took command saw at once that after severe check bhawulpoor men have received amid confusion prevailed battle be lost if enemy at once advanced turning to peer ibraheem who have just arrived chief officer pointed out that enemy have taken up strong position evidently expected to be attacked that therefore have time to get men in order to retrieve day gun of nawab be old piece of various size quite unfit for service there be hope of successfully contending against far better gun experienced artilleryman of enemy nothing must therefore be done until general cortlandt arrived with artillery be match for of sikh therefore ordered that troop after being got into order must all lie down that gun must keep up incessant even if ineffectual fire feeling confident now that have commander on whom must rely officer hurried away to carry out instruction similar order be sent to pathan who have with greatest difficulty be restrained from following example of bhawulpoor men rushing against enemy position messenger be instantly sent off to cortlandt urging to get gun across river with greatest possible despatch to bring forward to field of battle lieutenant edwardes then rode along line be loudly cheered by ally own men latter have stuck standard upright in turf be lying down in line behind when have made inspection of line seen that order have be carried out edwardes despatched messenger to cortlandt lest first must have gone astray telling that thought possible to hold position until three o'clock in afternoon that if did not arrive with gun by time battle must be lost be now eight o'clock in morning for several hour body of undisciplined troop must have to support in patience fire of enemy situation most trying even for most disciplined soldier for six hour continued without slackening enemy gun be directed principally to right where bhawulpoor artillery continued to fire steadily sufficient shot fell among pathan to work up into state of desperation so that number kept leaping to foot demanding to be led against enemy instead of lying there to be killed without even firing shot at two o'clock futteh muhommud recovered sens sufficiently to issue order for army to retire a be supposed that order be authorized by edwardes be obeyed without latter being aware of what be taking place bhawulpoor force gradually fell back from position on opposite hill rung ram who be in command of enemy observed movement at once prepared to take advantage of sent forward cavalry to reconnoitre moved infantry artillery slowly down hill hitherto ten camel gun that pathan have brought across river with have be silent a men be partly concealed in jungle lieutenant edwardes be anxious to avoid betraying position drawing fire of enemy upon by use of small piece must do little execution at distance be now necessary to run risk camel gun opened upon enemy cavalry who cantered back to line in disorder gun however at once began to play shot tore into jungle rendering more difficult than ever for lieutenant edwardes to restrain impetuosity of men enemy cavalry soon rallied again advanced a nothing have be heard of gun moment be most critical edwardes ordered foujdar chief mounted officer to form into compact body charge enemy cavalry delighted at being at last employed on service however dangerous brave fellow mounted with shout charged down upon enemy in spite of inferior number drove back in headlong flight upon infantry rallied quickly however whole line again advanced can no longer delay lieutenant edwardes said to percy only chance be in general charge if remain here must be beaten whereas if go at escape annihilation by artillery musketry a advance be just possible may be successful rose from seat under tree to give order when bugle sound be heard in rear a if by magic sound of excited angry talk along pathan line ceased until minute later bugle call be again heard there be mistaking van cortlandt gun have passed river must soon be at hand long terrible time of waiting be over at last table must be turned messenger be sent off to gun to tell commander how urgent be need of arrival while officer be despatched all along line of pathan to bid men stand up when word be given to advance in good order in regular line company by company against enemy with shout of delight pathan sprang to foot standard be plucked up waved enthusiastically in air then long line stood panting eager a greyhound in slip for order to advance soon rumble of gun be heard then amid wild cheer six gun passed through space opened for passage unlimbered opened fire upon advancing enemy effect be instantaneous sikh believing that day be won be advancing in good order through intervening field of sugar cane breast high a ball sung overhead disappeared from sight dropping among cane a suddenly a if have be mortally struck have believed that only gun opposed to on right have left field at discharge in regular order of gun of equal weight calibre truth broke upon that force under white officer who have so long withstood have crossed river be ranged on field before not only have gun arrived van cortlandt have managed to send two of mussulman infantry regiment with breathless with speed at have hurried after gun now came clattering up be ordered to lie down to right left of gun while pathan took post behind for few minute gun of contending force discharged volley of grape at other cortlandt gunner be better trained cooler two of enemy piece be silenced a men serving others be in confusion edwardes gave word for mussulman regiment to charge with cheer brave fellow dashed forward at full speed not so swiftly that little party of seven eight of pathan mounted officer dashed past charging gun captured two of while gunner be in act of hastily withdrawing before approach of charging infantry infantry captured only other gun awaited assault during charge cortlandt gun poured grape into cane where enemy infantry be lying hearing own artillery retiring infantry abandoned cover retreated at full speed rallying however at point where gun halted when artillery on side renewed duel pathan be now ordered to charge with yell expressive of delight at prospect of avenging loss during long hour of day rushed forward through smoke enemy be unable to withstand onset of brave irregular two newly arrived regiment hastily retired falling more more into confusion pressed in retreat by eager pathan while nawab troop anxious to retrieve first retreat now hotly pressed on enemy left something like order be maintained by sikh until reached crest of hill on have be posted during early hour of day then threw away arm fled in utter disorder towards mooltan pursued by nawab cavalry mowed down by gun opened upon a soon a must be got into position on hill eight out of ten gun that have brought from mooltan be captured by victor twelve hundred be slain great number of fugitive at once made for home pathan cavalry have for most part remained inactive during day heaviest loss fell upon revolted sikh regiment goorkhas who have so basely deserted agnew suffering very severely loss upon part of ally amounted to three hundred killed wounded enemy tent ammunition store at noonar fell into hand of victor percy have remained with lieutenant edwardes short time having be despatched by to aid peer ibraheem in keeping bhawulpoor men in position when order have come for to retreat have made way a rapidly a possible through jungle to inform edwardes of what have taken place arrived only in time to see charge of mounted officer must get back into place again grove here be order to peer ibraheem scribbled line on page of note book tore out be to bring back into position again to disregard order futteh muhommud may give percy hurried away again by exertion of peer ibraheem bhawulpoor men be brought up in time to join in final charge pursuit of enemy accompanied native cavalry a chased fugitive across country be almost dark before returned to scene of battle edwardes shook warmly by hand a dismounted have be great day grove must not go through seven hour waiting again for money must be offered be awful time be indeed percy agreed thought at one time that be up with so did be well indeed that be able to bring up nawab men in time be not wanted for fighting if have not be for horse rebel must have got away in sort of order leader might have taken in body into mooltan a be expect great proportion of will scatter to home have just sent off messenger with report of engagement to resident will be relief to for although gave way at last to entreaty know thought ought never to have crossed indus now if will give leave think that can take mooltan few day later lieutenant lake who have be appointed political agent to nawab arrived at camp thereby relieving edwardes of anxiety caused by inefficiency of futteh muhommud a lake authority completely overrode that of general be too intimate friend of edwardes being full of life animation be great addition to pleasure of little mess marching forward be joined by sheikh emamoodeen with remains of division sikh troop have deserted have with few mussulman infantry strong body of cavalry on st of july force started for last march towards mooltan have received news that sikh gooroo man regarded with greatest veneration have after consulting star declared that day to be most auspicious one that moolraj have decided therefore upon again giving battle came out in great force took up position at bridge across wide deep canal a must not be forced without heavy loss edwardes moved along west of canal towards mooltan moolraj followed on other side of canal crossed by bridge near mooltan at one o'clock moved forward against edwardes in order of battle bhawulpoor men commanded by lieutenant lake be on right general cortlandt two regiment ten gun be on right centre pathan levy be next to having on left sheikh emamoodeen troop battle began on right lieutenant lake seizing mound in front of placing gun there opened heavy fire on enemy left be returned by sikh gun in short time battle became general along whole line village of suddoosam be in centre of enemy position troop lay for most part concealed in jungle gun occupying two three small village ally be superior in artillery rebel gun be presently obliged to withdraw from position order be then given for advance whole line pressed forward village after village be captured at point of bayonet sikh inflamed with religious ardour offering most determined resistance favoured by nature of ground be largely covered with jungle date grove intersected by irrigation canal there be however check in advance brilliant charge be made by one of cortlandt regiment led by mr quin young man who have few day before come up a clerk writer to lieutenant edwardes gun be captured whole line then went forward with rush enemy broke fled in complete disorder loss on part of ally in killed wounded be under three hundred that of enemy be vastly greater being result to large extent of cowardice of moolraj who be first to leave field who in order to check pursuit planted gun at bridge over canal with order to allow one to pas sikh fugitive on arrival be fired at by artillery greater part of crowd pressed hard by pursuer forced passage hundred be drowned in trying to cross canal at close of day allied force halted for night within range of gun of fortress percy saw little of fight a early in advance be struck by matchlock ball while riding forward with pathan cavalry for moment lost sensibility fell when recovered two follower be beside where be hit asked in left shoulder sahib be bad wound will be troublesome thanks be to allah might have be much worse now that have recovered will fetch up dhooly with bearer carry on after others white sahib will know best what must be done with wound few minute later percy be placed in dhooly be borne in rear of advancing troop a soon a halted for night be brought forward to house have be chosen by edwardes a head quarter not badly hurt hope grove officer said running out from house a soon a heard that percy be outside have be wondering what have become of have idea have be hit think that be serious percy said left shoulder bone be smashed think by ball men be close behind bandaged up then one of fetched dhooly for have be following pretty close behind afternoon lake will bandage up properly will soon have comfortable be nuisance that have english surgeon with native doctor be quite useless if be nothing worse than smashed shoulder think can manage well enough may hope to be about again with arm in sling before long only thing have to be afraid of in hot place be fever still hope that will avoid that during week followed percy lay on charpoy heat be terrible although everything possible be done by putting tatties in front of window keeping soaked with water bhop lal comrade sat by turn night day fanning while punka made of door taken off hinge be kept constantly going overhead be not alone in misfortune for lieutenant edwardes be lying also wounded in bed in same room two day after battle have on news that enemy be again sallying out hastily thrust pistol into belt being engaged in giving order paid little heed to what be doing hammer of one of pistol caught in scarf without looking down seized barrel in right hand to pull down when pistol exploded ball went through palm of hand shattering bone inflicting wound deprived of use of right hand for life fortunately twelve day later english surgeon arrived from lahore at once afforded relief from intense pain be suffering from unskilful treatment of native surgeon percy too gained great benefit from arrival of doctor be in few day able to be about with arm strapped tightly to side immediately after battle of suddoosam edwardes have written off to lahore begging that few heavy gun might be sent to in order that might undertake siege of place lieutenant lake general cortlandt be convinced must be successfully carried out moolraj garrison being greatly weakened by desertion after two battle disheartened by failure of gooroo prophecy request have be refused by governor general commander in chief whose opinion be that operation must be undertaken by english troop until hot season be over pointed out that lieutenant edwardes who have now received rank of brevet major a reward for great service have carried out that have proposed to do district to west south of mooltan have be wrested from moolraj collection of revenue be going on quietly regularly moolraj be cooped up in mooltan be practically powerless for mischief therefore be necessary be that edwardes must carry out plan have originally proposed namely to drive moolraj into fortress blockade there through hot season few day later however sir frederick currie influenced by letter edwardes have sent before decision of government have be arrived at determined to take upon responsibility of ordering general whish with two regiment of european two of native infantry three regiment of native cavalry three company of european one of native artillery two troop of native horse artillery to march from lahore left on th of july be taken down by water to bhawulpoor reached mooltan on th of august heavy gun however did not arrive until th of september in addition to pain edwardes have be suffering from wound have be going through period of great anxiety whole sikh nation be in ferment disaster have befallen moolraj have in way checked ardour chuttur singh father of sher singh be in open rebellion have be known be urging son in name alike of patriotism religion family honour to join in great national effort to wipe out defeat of last campaign to restore to punjaub lost territory so far sher singh have resisted entreaty have given evidence of desire to remain faithful to government of lahore from first have be almost powerless in hand of troop number of have deserted made way to mooltan constant communication be kept up with rebel be certain that at first opportunity offered whole force must go over in body to moolraj while battle of koreyshee suddoosam be being fought division remained inactive at little more than day march from mooltan moolraj showed by sending out available man to attack force of edwardes that have fear whatever of hostility on part of sikh when therefore few day after suddoosam sher singh army advanced encamped within mile of ally heavy burden be added to various anxiety of wounded english commander sher singh visited frequently be profuse in declaration of loyalty a be two officer next in command uttur shumsher singh while former hoped that troop must remain faithful two lieutenant be absolutely convinced that must go over to enemy edwardes felt must understanding between sikh moolraj be complete former fall upon flank while whole mooltan force attacked in front position must be one of greatest difficulty be great relief to when two three more english officer came up be at last certain that order issued from bed of sickness must be thoroughly carried out by be still heavier load off mind when general whish arrived with force assumed command of siege operation by time be able to get about percy wound be almost completely healed on th of plan for siege be arranged at council of chief political military officer trench be opened at much greater distance than usual a ground outside wall be largely occupied with house garden cut up by small canal be in hand of enemy must be necessary to advance gradually step by step on th fighting began attempt being made to carry house ruin occupied by rebel latter however defended stoutly little ground be gained sikh who be skilled in defensive warfare have thrown up numerous intrenchment stockade in front of line on th be attacked large village be carried only after desperate fighting two hundred fifty men being killed wounded on british side point be gained however close enough to wall for establishment of battering gun few day at most must have seen british flag waving over wall of mooltan when suddenly sher singh with whole army went over to enemy defection entirely changed situation addition of sikh force of disciplined soldier to army of moolraj raised to strength far exceeding that of besieger even without addition have only be by very hard fighting that british have won way forward difficulty have now be enormously increased communication might be threatened cut off even officer most sanguine of success of siege now felt that be no longer feasible with so small force decision to abandon siege be arrived at chiefly upon other ground until now although moolraj have be joined by great many sikh deserter sikh nation still stood irresolute be hoped that capture of mooltan must have decided to abstain from engaging in contest be nominally one between maharajah adviser at lahore moolraj rebellious servant defection of sher singh lahore army of be commander changed whole situation be certain now that sikh must everywhere rise that whole of punjaub must soon be in arm capture of mooltan therefore became matter of secondary importance behoved general whish to keep force intact in view of campaign must ensue moreover must now no longer rely upon communication being kept open supply forwarded for sikh sirdar with follower might throw on rear lahore might fall into hand of sikh for since despatch of general whish force to mooltan be very weakly garrisoned be therefore unanimously decided that for present siege must be raised army abandoning new work fell back couple of mile took up strong defensive position expecting to be attacked by allied force of moolraj sher singh such attack be however made sher singh have up to last moment so strongly opposed wish of troop to go over when at last gave way moolraj suspected movement to be snare refused to open gate of mooltan to sikh suspicion be heightened by letter edwardes sent to sher singh by hand of messenger whose fidelity strongly suspected a anticipated letter be carried to moolraj be of nature to increase very greatly suspicion of good faith of sher singh latter however at once issued proclamation be signed sealed by moolraj principal officer sirdar calling upon whole sikh nation to rise moolraj still declared that only thing to satisfy mind must be for sher singh to issue out attack british position did a soon a english artillery began to play upon troop retired hastily conduct increasing suspicion felt by moolraj of intention ill feeling between ally increased until on th of october singh marched away with army to join sikh force already in arm plundering burning mahomedan village through passed news of defection be followed immediately by revolt of sikh troop at bunnoo other place in course of two three week whole sikh nation be under arm work have be done a be hoped completed at moodkee ferozeshah aliwal sobraon have to be begun afresh percy grove be not with british force fell back from position four five hundred yard from wall of mooltan three four day before sher singh defection major edwardes have said to mr grove think must be best for to take up quarter with sher singh force position be difficult one be weak vacillating must be well that must have someone by side to whom must appeal frequently presence too of british officer must strengthen authority with troop have doubt be well disposed influence brought to bear on be tremendous a son must be contrary to sikh notion of honour to oppose father however much might differ from then there be appeal to patriotism to religion know that whole of men be in favour of revolt there be two three of officer who be not of same way of thinking say that there be not danger in taking up abode among for if go over will go over suddenly even if doe can not think that must suffer to be injured be not fanatic must see that did harm come to must have hope whatever of pardon will of course ride in here at once must discover that there be change in attitude towards percy accordingly moved across to sher singh camp tent being erected there for liked rajah of whom have seen good deal since arrival like edwardes be convinced that assurance of loyalty be made in good faith believed must be perfectly safe might happen that be

indeed be sore that fidelity must be suspected in conversation with percy after latter have established in tent close to frequently complained that after having so long withstood entreaty of father wish of troop must be suspected percy did best to assure that personally major edwardes have doubt of loyalty that feared only that might not be able to control troop have so far controlled sher singh said have not brought here instead of allowing to march into mooltan why then must be doubted now if have wished to go must not have be better must have done so before white troop arrived have hard work in beating moolraj alone if have joined before edwardes bhawulpoor troop must have be destroyed have joined moolraj rajah must never have crossed indus must troop of nawab have be here major edwardes know well that have done best belief that did troop revolt must ride into camp be not good will that doubt power over soldier know that be in hourly communication with enemy that go freely in out of town that messenger pas between countryman who have gone over be easy to understand placed a be here carrying on siege with scant force for such operation can not be most anxious regarding force like yours lying so close to have still strong hope that will be able to keep firm be otherwise must not have sent here be anxiety not suspicion that cause so earnestly to beg to stand firm bhop lal akram chunder be charged to learn a much a must from soldier a to intention report be favourable to rajah soldier be for moolraj bhop lal said speak of rajah by nickname of 'the mahomedan be alone who keep here for though uttur singh shumsher support be almost alone among officer sher singh be powerful rajah family one of first among sirdar of punjaub be reason why have be able to keep from going over for fear that if did so in face of opposition must afterwards suffer at hand of family even if cause be victorious seem agreed that there be chance of rajah throwing in lot with father curse a one who be false to family country religion be then complete surprise to percy when after retiring to bed on night of th of september be suddenly aroused by entrance of body of armed men into tent belonged a saw at once to rajah own bodyguard be commanded by one of most trusted officer harm be intended latter said rajah order be that be to be honourably treated must beg to rise dress at once a be going to move camp seeing that resistance must be altogether useless percy at once rose after putting on clothes saw that arm have be taken possession of by soldier that be in fact prisoner without making remark passed out of tent saw two men standing there with very crestfallen face holding horse surrounded by body of sikh mounted sikh cavalry at once closed in round tent have be struck already baggage packed troop formed up uttur shumsher singh have a afterwards learned done utmost to carry off men under command to british line have be surrounded by officer entreating abusing threatening stirring up soldier till be forced to abstain from opposing popular demand uttur singh have then mounted horse with great difficulty made way through crowd riding off to carry intelligence to major edwardes followed by two other officer shumsher singh have be carried off a prisoner be confined in tent next night managed to crawl out under bottom of tent made way in common clothes bare footed several mile to british camp killing on road one of sher singh vedettes who tried to arrest two therefore out of three sikh leader justified major edwardes belief in fidelity on arriving at new place of encampment under wall of fort percy remained for hour in centre of guard be then conducted to tent have again be pitched hour later two servant came in be deeply humiliated that must have given master warning of what be coming poured out apology expression of regret be not fault in way percy said be yesterday afternoon that rajah be even warmer than usual in protestation of loyalty yet at time must have fully made up mind a to course have troop known yesterday must certainly have noticed difference in bearing can not have issued order until late in evening see took measure for protection by sending own bodyguard to protect have probably carried off partly a hostage partly perhaps with thought may be useful must circumstance make necessary for again to enter into negotiation with people how be have not entered fort sikh intended to go in sahib moolraj kept gate closed sent order that be to encamp here under gun of fort suppose that be afraid of treachery sikh be very angry suppose have taken arm percy said yes sahib be sleeping at door of tent pounced upon suddenly twisting scarf round mouth to prevent calling out carried short distance away then released ordered to saddle horse yours warned that if made least outcry must be signal for death a well a own in morning sher singh came into tent be sorry have be compelled to make prisoner sahib grove have choice have not done so stir among troop must have awoke might have carried news to camp in time for horseman gun to interfere with movement did too a much for protection a own for of troop might have rushed in killed have not be in hand of own guard thank for rajah percy said quietly life be of little consequence in comparison to other matter until now have only be question of overthrow of dewan who refused to render obedience to government whom army be despatched to conquer instead of army have gone over joined know even better than do what mean that punjaub will be up that ten of thousand of life will be lost can only hope that like be here against will no rajah said passionately be faithful be doubted withstood entreaty of father adjuration of chief men of religion wish of army when found that in spite of be suspected be useless for to strive longer be no longer general of durbar of lahore sikh prince be truly sorry to hear percy said gravely for own sake for of punjaub there can be one end to if when whole khalsa army be intact sikh must not withstand advance of weak british force to lahore what chance have against army a will be collected now last time england astonished sikh by clemency by taking so little when be in power thought that strength clemency must alike have made impression that sikh must henceforth be content remain in peace time will assuredly make such mistake consider highness defection will lead to destruction of independence of punjaub that will see rajah said last time small portion of sirdar took up arm have to fight against troop who have long lost discipline now will have whole of sikh nation against be sikh nation ten time a numerous a be percy said quietly end must be same however a highness have now taken course be useless for to endeavour to dissuade have to thank for having taken mean to secure safety must have thanked still more have ordered bodyguard to conduct to camp instead of bringing here must not do sher singh replied must have caused own men to suspect be assured that be well honourably treated told regarded a guest in camp a guest will always be treated save in matter of liberty wish may express will be granted if at time have complaint to make send message will come see set matter right in morning when sher singh men be about to march against british camp bhop lal said to percy there will be fighting sahib sikh be very angry at refusal of moolraj to admit into town say have not revolted in order to fight for moolraj for country may advance because gun of mooltan look down into camp dare not therefore refuse will soon be back here again be eager to march away will do so ere long mooltan be nothing to know well enough that moolraj be fighting for alone be british expelled there must be war to decide whether moolraj sikh be to be master of punjaub until sikh marched away on th of october percy did not again see sher singh rajah indeed sent message contained most bitter complaint against major edwardes for having by letter be intercepted increased doubt of moolraj a to loyalty percy replied that of course knew nothing of letter that general like sher singh must know well that in war be always matter of policy on part of leader to cause disunion if possible between ally opposed to that doubtless must under similar circumstance have acted in precisely same manner there be actual prohibition against percy leaving tent officer in command of guard who kept vigilant watch round strongly advised not to do so rajah have given into charge said hold responsible for safety how can guarantee that if go about in camp might surround with guard yet musket pistol ball fired by fanatic might hit be far better that must remain in tent where be out of sight of out of thought if once see about fanatic might stir up men to demand life to insist that sher singh must give stronger proof of hostility to english a moolraj did when permitted murder of two english officer although rajah wish well may be unable to resist demand of troop who be rather master than theirs percy felt justice of argument remained quietly in tent where learned from two follower be passing a in native costume be able to move about freely among sikh of whom indeed few be aware that servant of british officer who have be carried off with have also be taken men being mahomedans burned with indignation at atrocity committed by sikh upon mussulman village on line of march where burned house robbed people defiled mosque murdered priest be that way to fight for independence of country sahib be there not great number of mahomedans in punjaub be not enough to have to fight english without making mahomedan hostile to be not so before mahomedans sikh be of one mind a to independence of punjaub now mahomedans will be a one man in hope that british will win know under british master man can worship in own way without interference must see now that if sikh conquer will root out mahomedans from among akram followed sahib stood fire of sikh gun because lord have bidden guard except for heart be rather with sikh than with countryman for have not taken sikh pay fought under sikh standard henceforth be different sikh have showed bitter enemy hope must now be with english see chance of escape none at at present four guard watch day night near tent be forced to picket horse in line of sikh trooper horse be placed among of rajah whence have to fetch morning for march party of sowars always ride with to fetch accompany back of course have knife have stolen at night from sleeping men must get other arm see at present must do anything with there be possibility of escaping in daytime percy agreed men who ride beside always have chain between horse bit mine so there be possibility of making sudden dash for a otherwise must have done if once got beyond range of pistol must have little fear of being overtaken for there can be few horse in camp be match for sheik day after day passed officer in charge of percy in way relaxed vigilance order of sher singh being most emphatic a to care to be exercised in guarding prisoner learned from follower rumour current in camp that sikh troop at bunnoo rhotas have also mutinied be upon point of effecting junction with sher singh force be considered flower of sikh army being composed entirely of old soldier with trained cavalry artillery sher singh be marching to lahore although people there be for time powerless in face of force have be hurried up to hold city a soon a defection of sher singh be known be reported a ready to rise at first appearance of army before wall of sikh cavalry have be pushed on ahead of army with order to destroy bridge of boat across ravee mile half from lahore succeeded in burning of boat be then driven off by th light dragoon under colonel havelock so far large force of british have arrived brigade with one english regiment have be pushed forward one of cavalry have assembled at ferozepore native report stated that large reinforcement be going forward to general whish others advancing towards ferozepore sher singh army moved slowly be still opinion of many british officer although constrained to desert at mooltan must be glad to make peace a soon a strong british army approached at end of first week in first british division under general thackwell crossed sutlej advanced towards lahore two day later commander in chief with general gilbert division followed heavy gun have not yet come up be only short distance behind general be anxious to interpose force between lahore sikh army might day advance to attack remained for two day at lahore thackwell division having already advanced will be here in two three day sahib akram chunder said one morning to percy have strong position here on right bank of chenab how english be going to cross know still will do somehow be quite certain now sahib be time must look to so long a sikh be confident of victory doubt will be a well treated a be at present if be defeated a very well know will be who must answer for life sher singh will have enough to do to look after own safety even if soldier did not rush in kill men of guard will not want to be encumbered with prisoner must know that after defeat one be likely to inquire much about so must try to escape worst of be that with friend so close will be more watchful than ever for be time that must be naturally trying to get away to join officer look so sharp after guard fear there be chance of giving liquor making drunk of drugging be forbidden even to speak to a go in out be allowed to attend on by rajah order have doubt officer be afraid might try to bribe men bhop lal have talked over in way can see mean of getting out can see way akram sentry be very vigilant keep constantly on move challenge anyone who approach within twenty yard if be to march during night must take chance of slipping off horse for be impossible chained a be to others to dash through with be only possibility of escape can see at present can see other sahib unfortunately never have marched at night still may do so first time do might try worst of be that will not be near sahib see on march always have to keep with cavalry among whom horse be picketed well at rate akram let be distinct understanding that if be suddenly ordered to make night march have opportunity of speaking to before move mean to make escape if by possibility can do same be to do so a have told often sahib there be difficulty about have got pretty well accustomed to now believe that be in favour of cause though remain with because in first place be attached to in second because have wife family who be in hand of uncle colonel dare not therefore leave so have come to believe that have wish to escape at pay attention to on line of march of course ride at rear of regiment last four men be always told off to ride behind have given that up long ago must easily drop behind without being observed on night march difficulty must be to find after escape that ca be helped akram if do escape will make way back to last place at halted if get away do same if find other there better if not must make way separately a best can to british line wherever may be will if can come to spot where tent be pitched will know position pretty well ought to be able to get somewhere near even on dark night now remember that be final order if have opportunity to give others first night there be march whether before battle have be fought afterwards will try to escape if appear at last halting place during night be to go straight on to line if turn up there in course of couple of day will know have failed to make escape be killed in attempting understand sahib may be sure bhop lal will act according to order two day later there be great hubbub heard in camp bhop lal looking out from door of tent said army have come sikh on other bank be retiring percy went to entrance of tent faced river stood there looking out number of horse foot must be seen crossing cloud of dust rose mile half away while in camp there be deep rumble of gun a be brought up to river to command passage be cavalry sahib bhop lal said a amid cloud of dust there be sparkle of steel body of horse came clashing forward almost at same instant crack of gun be heard shell burst over among sikh on other side of river greatly hastening movement bed of river be of great width be now for most part dry on other side bank be high from foot very wide bed of sand extended to what in wet season be green island in middle of river stream ran on sikh side of island before british cavalry gun came up last of sikh force on other side be well on way across river gun be at once unlimbered sent shot after shot into until be almost across out of range for width from bank to bank be nearly two mile not content with two british battery moved down from bank charged across sand from time to time firing at sikh retreating across ford when came near edge of river sikh battery on high bank opened upon will have to fall back percy said gun here be much heavier than theirs can never remain there in open exposed to fire be not long before officer commanding british battery discovered gave order for gun to limber up confusion be visible among horse be taken from two of gun attached to gun have got into quicksand something of sort percy said ca move sikh be not long in seeing fire of gun be redoubled infantry at once paused in passage of ford returned in great number to left bank opened heavy musketry fire will have to leave gun behind percy said a artillery mounted rode off gun indeed dragged so heavily through deep sand that squadron of d light dragoon galloped forward to cover retreat dashing over sand swept round island where hundred of enemy be drawn up cut way through sabring number then in spite of fire of six gun on opposite bank cantered back again have only one man wounded two horse killed other charge be made by d dragoon th light cavalry sikh took refuge in nullah kept up such galling musketry fire that cavalry drew off sikh now exultantly advanced to abandoned gun a from river bed british force must no longer be seen number of made way across sand ascended high bank opened fire at troop halted within rifle shot wo be there long percy said to men will see coming back quicker than went in minute two look at body of cavalry sweeping down upon sikh too saw danger came rushing in confused mass down bank cavalry a learned afterwards consisted of th dragoon under colonel havelock supported by th light cavalry impetuosity of gallant leader of th carried away followed by men dashed down bank in pursuit with intention of driving sikh back again over river great number have now crossed ford gun have be placed near island battery on other bank opened heavy fire upon cavalry encouraged by fire of gun by numerical strength fugitive now made stand horse of dragoon be already blown with difficulty made way through deep sand havelock charged into middle of enemy well in advance of men disappeared from sight tried to urge horse after must not break through infantry while sikh gun still continued heavy fire colonel cureton who commanded cavalry rode forward to recall from dangerous position fell shot through heart for time unequal contest be continued many desperate single combat taking place between englishman sikh at last th be called off having have upwards of fifty men killed wounded seems to percy said a last of cavalry rode up opposite bank be very foolish charge suppose have driven sikh across river must not have stayed to guard ford with gun playing upon sikh must have recrossed directly have retired seems pure waste of life so thought many others charge be a rash ill considered a of balaclava colonel havelock paid for mistake by life just a did nolan who gave order led to charge of light cavalry at sikh be in high spirit at advantage have gained complete confidence in took place of doubt that good many of have felt of power of resisting british increased a day after day passed forward movement be made from opposite bank must be seen however that force there have be largely augmented that battery be in course of erection at several point sikh gun fired at time at working party distance be too great for fire to be effective body of sikh cavalry crossed river at other point often rode round rear of british line occasionally cutting off men who have straggled too far out of camp then riding off before english cavalry must mount pursue few soldier who be taken alive be carried to camp where be well treated by sher singh be sent back to british line bearing communication from rajah expressive of desire for peace time have passed for negotiation be necessary for peace of india that sikh strength must be broken once for answer sent to rajah be that commander in chief must not treat with men in arm against week passed after cavalry fight then became known in sikh camp that heavy gun for british have be waiting have arrived see use of battery be erecting on opposite bank akram chunder remarked a standing at door of tent watched what be going on sikh too have be working hard strong work have be erected commanding ford number of gun placed there in position see good in akram gun be too far off to be of use whatever in covering advance of column trying to cross think be possible to ford river in face of such fire a will be concentrated upon if attempt then what will do sahib must say must send force up down river to cross at other point ten twenty mile away when have got across will intrench there defend ford until whole army can cross will march way attack camp while army opposite try to cross river there must be great risk in sahib for sikh must throw whole force on have crossed destroy before must get aid from friend on other side yes must be very dangerous too dangerous to try must say against european force see akram have be so accustomed to win battle in india that feel quite confident of victory even when odds be three four to one against early in morning of st of december percy heard unusual stir in sikh camp what be matter asked officer of guard when latter a usual came in for talk with peasant came across before daylight with news that large force of people have marched somewhere down river have thought that might try to cross at ford of ghuree kee puttum be ready to receive have not gone there be supposed have gone to wuzeerabad how far be that away twenty four mile have force there be very bad ford unless get boat can hardly cross there must not stop if must how british who know so much of art of war can throw like into hand be more than can tell will let march up mile so that can no longer retreat to ford then will fall upon exterminate know force for peasant who be awakened by noise made by camp follower growling of camel rumbling of gun crept up counted a passed there be five battery two of native five regiment of cavalry four of native two white regiment of foot five regiment half of sepoys if put at five hundred men to regiment there be le than four thousand foot what be against force can bring against will get to wuzeerabad to day be long march white troop will not be ready for much at end of few will get across to night will be mid day to morrow before be over even if have boat so that at most will not arrive nearer than twelve mile by to morrow night next day will finish with percy thought be a well to keep to conviction that sikh must not find so easy business a anticipated yet saw that unless main army moved across to attack so occupied large portion of sikh force else considerably reinforced that advancing up river bank position of latter be indeed perilous one still felt confident in power to resist attack made upon must be glad said to two follower a talked matter over during day if must move tent of ours somewhere farther back from bank battery below be sure to come in for share of fire from gun on other side ball go too high be a likely a not to pas through tent may be sure that guard wo wait here when happens sahib may leave tent standing will certainly march off out of range late in afternoon heavy fire be opened by battery on opposite bank a shell exploded over sikh battery farther back over bank great hubbub arose artilleryman ran down to gun replied to fire drum bugle called troop under arm order be shouted in direction noise of horse baggage animal added to uproar guard at once ran up surrounded tent come out sahib officer said be going to pull down at once better percy replied have desire to be shot by friend tent be speedily lowered content carried by men mile from bank there re erected other tent along bank be similarly removed a percy have foreseen fire from distant gun inflicted little damage upon sikh battery so after replying for short time ceased to waste ammunition men retired behind shelter of bank where remained until british fire ceased upon following morning percy learned from officer of guard that sikh horseman who have be sent down river have reported that only battery of artillery two regiment of cavalry brigade of infantry have crossed on previous night wading ford others being brought over in boat by gun have be conveyed across at night heard that be two o'clock before have crossed march began must probably halt at doorewal be twelve mile on way somewhere about sikh reported that cavalry be scouting in front on left flank that troop be marching in several column so that must at once open out into order of battle if attacked guard be in high spirit night sat round fire laughing talking until morning vigilance of sentry however be in way relaxed officer several time peeped into tent to see that be right before daybreak there be hum of movement in camp percy knew that sikh be mustering for attack chapter xviii rejoining a percy went to door of tent saw sikh moving off in solid body be bunnoo regiment officer of guard said be best of sher singh regiment be good be not equal to from bunnoo have be drilled by van cortlandt march a truly well a best regiment of feringhees be going to take revenge to day man of fought at ferozeshah sobraon many at will wipe out defeat to day very strong force be going nearly whole indeed what do want men here for will never venture to cross from opposite side while gun sweep ford besides there be regiment left to guard feringhees can not tell that sher singh have marched with whole force to exterminate comrade on bank will not be lonely more for to night there will be many prisoner here for who throw down arm may be spared not order sher singh have issued still mercy be sure to be shown to few by way have just seen man who have come from river bank say that during night people have thrown up two battery about mid way between bank river so a to command ford doubtless feared that knowing must be so weakened must march across destroy be indeed plan advocated by many of leader be thought best to destroy army first for see can fall upon when entangled in rice field jungle whereas here must suffer from battery on bank before came to close quarter a officer have be very civil to throughout march percy abstained from dashing confidence by expression of doubt be going to fall upon during march yes regular horse be to ride round capture baggage then charge down on rear river be on right not man ought to escape if affair be well managed throughout day gun of british battery across river again maintained fire sikh making reply percy from time to time listened attentively hoping to hear rattle of musketry must tell that lord gough be making vigorous attempt to cross river in order to give aid to little column be cut off from heard that british be constructing two battery close to river be astonished that must be permitted to do without interruption be mistaken officer said to at eight o'clock thought that battery be still manned that regiment be there find that gun have be withdrawn that man have gone to fight be very strange that seeing everything be silent english send party across river to reconnoitre commander must be asleep sikh said contemptuously why have passage be left open to what do care if do cross tent be almost only one left standing if saw appear on river bank must mount ride at once there be horse standing ready almost baggage be moved away think sher singh must be glad if did cross to day then must come back attack in morning with river in rear how many must escape be past mid day when exclamation broke from percy guard a boom of gun six seven mile away be heard battle have begun sikh exclaimed there be animated discussion among a to distance be agreed at last that must be somewhere in neighbourhood of village of sadoolapore be situated close to ford british have probably halted there in order to have loophole for retreat halt have indeed be made at point in order that infantry brigade of general godby commander in chief have sent to reinforce might cross ford have not however a yet arrived column having halted prepared to take breakfast while so engaged cannon shot fell close by nicholson irregular pathan horse at once went out in direction from shot be fired be soon in contact with enemy whose artillery opened heavy fire troop at once formed up for battle in front of be three small village surrounded by plantation afforded admirable cover for enemy must have enabled to mass unperceived to pour down upon line seeing disadvantage of position general thackwell who be in command of force ordered to fall back so a to have clear ground in front of movement caused shout of exultation among unseen enemy who construed into movement of retreat time however elapsed before sikh force have assembled a soon a have done so battery opened fire while yell of defiance mingled with blowing of horn beating of drum added to tumult of cannon musketry british infantry lay down on ground storm of iron lead swept over almost harmlessly great body of sikh cavalry now showed on flank with evident intention of penetrating to rear cavalry aided by horse artillery met checked on flank while three other battery placed in interval of infantry regiment replied to of enemy accurate fire caused considerable confusion among sikh gunner whose fire gradually slackened at last ceased though infantry still maintained position in front extreme rapidity with for two hour british artillery worked gun have almost exhausted supply of ammunition have brought with when general thackwell consulted officer whether must now take offensive attack sikh reply be almost unanimous negative be about four o'clock in afternoon there be two hour daylight left enemy infantry be intact be in full force to front three village constituted very strong position nature of ground beyond be altogether unknown be believed that sugar cane field extended to sikh intrenchment troop be already exhausted with long day exposure to sun godby brigade have not yet crossed with two white regiment must have be perilous indeed to engage in conflict on unknown ground against enemy of vastly superior strength containing bunnoo regiment flower of sikh army force too be already weakened by strong detachment covering head of ford by larger body detached to guard baggage in rear be therefore determined to rest for night in position occupied to renew engagement in morning when be hoped that godby brigade must have joined loss have be small twenty one men killed fifty one wounded most of whom belonged to artillery against arm sikh fire have be mainly directed to surprise disappointment of british be discovered in morning that sikh have evacuated position in front of godby brigade have be all night crossing river in three four little boat joined force at nine o'clock upon advancing into village be found that sikh loss have be very large great number of dead being discovered here among sugar cane behind cavalry be at once sent ahead to endeavour to discover course taken by sikh learned from villager that have passed during night along road leading towards jhelum river though cavalry pressed far in pursuit did not succeed in coming up with infantry marched twelve mile in direction have taken then halted for night be not until morning that lord gough sent small force across river discovered that sikh have left thirty six hour before for four hour percy have listened anxiously to continuous roll of artillery when ceased at four o'clock men round shouted triumphantly that be over feringhees annihilated news have be received when percy feeling worn out with excitement worry of day threw down on bed at ten o'clock heard horse approaching at gallop few word be said of must not gather import a be followed by volley of execration heart gave bound of delight for felt that sikh have failed in attack two minute later officer entered tent be to mount ride with at once sahib said shortly percy asked question feeling that silence be at present safest policy first thought be for men who always slept in camp of sowars where horse be picketed have not seen day have doubt that have be obliged to accompany cavalry when moved off at daybreak mounted horse be a usual linked to of trooper on side of party moved off silently leaving tent standing for hour few word be spoken beyond occasional muttered execration among sikh then officer rode up beside taking chain from trooper on right hand side be wrong sahib have not eaten up feringhees a expected have be drawn battle gun fired at fired at many be killed on side infantry never attacked did yours suffered most for infantry lay down on ground like coward while ours stood up like men still must not advance under terrible fire of gun so combat ceased march to night to take up new position on jhelum where be bush jungle why must fall back if battle be indecisive one because sahib felt too sure of victory left ford open here thinking a told that after have crushed troop went out to fight must march back here destroy force from across river calculation have be wrong have not won battle blind people on other side have not crossed though must have seen that there be man gun to resist to morrow must surely discover then when cross must find between two fire so there be nothing to do to fall back next time will fight on ground in thick jungle where white cavalry can not act gunner discover position then will see for three hour longer rode on officer have ceased to talk men be silent be percy guessed half asleep on horse night be so dark that must scarce make out figure riding beside went to heart to leave sheik wondered whether must lean forward unbuckle chain however abandoned idea for even must do so rattle of end of falling chain must at once rouse men knew nothing of country on side of road be following must assuredly come to grief did attempt to gallop over therefore fell back upon original plan taking foot from stirrup letting go rein quietly lifted back out of saddle then holding on by let slip off noiselessly over crupper a did so stooped low on ground trooper behind be riding two two with interval of foot between passed along on side of horse of two last trooper who be riding closer together than others swerved suddenly nearly unseating rider causing to burst into angry exclamation what can brute have shied at one asked other might be anything be reply lot of cart have be passing down road suppose something have dropped off one of a soon a have passed percy left road found that ground on side be covered with low scrub bush among made way cautiously have gone fifty yard when heard sudden shout followed by string of furious exclamation minute later trooper came galloping back along road stooped among bush a passed although confident that must not be seen have almost expected must rein in horse a came to point where have left road indeed must certainly have done so if trooper have told officer of sudden start horse have given a rode on without check concluded that men have said nothing of incident thinking that if did so must certainly incur blame probably severe punishment for not ascertaining what be that animal have shied at a soon a have passed returned to road for although must have kept general direction by mean of star might have got far away from direct track moreover might in dark have come upon broken ground fallen down hole nullah possibility must necessitate very slow careful walking therefore kept along road be so frequently obliged to leave owing to number of cart horseman peasant flying before expected advance of british that made slow progress however did not trouble sikh army have fallen back british cavalry must soon be scouring country principal reason for wishing to be back before evening be arrangement with two men be of course uncertain that must more than return to tent night having be with cavalry during battle must know nothing of what have taken place in camp have left must not have be certain that guard have not started for rear early in day in case must not have attempted to escape however if reached tent before morning must be sure to wait unless saw british troop crossing river in case must probably make off a might be cut down before must make understood that be servant of english officer a soon therefore a first dawn of light appeared moved farther away from road entered patch of low tree brushwood there sat watching road from time to time bullock cart pack animal came along generally in party under escort of small body of sowars who be evidently urging to push forward with haste sometimes bullock cart be provided with curtain doubt contained lady of zenana of zemindar of district who with retainer be with army spot where percy be hidden be at very edge of cultivated ground beyond wide field stretched away a far a must see here there peasant be at work a usual heeding very little event passing round confident must suffer molestation at hand of british that change must be likely to benefit rather than to harm a sun gained power percy began to feel torture of thirst well knew that there be hope of obtaining water a must not quit place of concealment until night again fell for dress must betray even at considerable distance have intended to watch until saw english troop coming along have be walking night a heat increased found impossible to keep eye open besides a told there be certainty that british cavalry must come along day after having allowed to be checked for day half by deserted earthwork there might be still farther delay even after crossing day might elapse before farther advance be made be turning over in mind when thought gradually became confused be soon sound asleep sun be setting when awoke on looking round saw that road be entirely deserted determined therefore to push forward through field at once in hope of discovering water for woke with raging thirst have walked for hour when saw cloud of dust on road at once leapt down into small nullah there concealed from sight ran towards road when heard tramping of horse rumbling of wheel took off white helmet raised head sufficiently high to look through tuft of grass at edge of nullah moment later be standing on top of bank waving hat to

upon baggage a soon a got out of shelter of sugar cane field battery of artillery opened at over went men horse be very uncomfortable almost a bad a be at ferozeshah for although be single battery shot told be firing grape shrapnel many of shell burst just in front of cut big gap in line then regiment of dragoon rode at though be handful sikh must not wait for bolted back into cane be done three four time bhop lal saw that sikh game be up cavalry be beaten on other flank just a thorough a be infantry never stirred foot beyond shelter so next time rode back into cane separated from rest there be difficulty about different troop have got mixed up together party be with have be killed rest have enough to think of without bothering about there be plenty of others drawing off wounded who did not want more of dismounted a soon a separated from others so that head must not show above cane led horse back for mile then mounted rode till got to nullah in hid firing went on for time then stopped knew that sikh have have enough of agreed that be best to wait where be find out what be going to do if marched back to camp must slip into rank again come with if did not must come on alone reconnoitre did not know how many troop have be left there so when got dark made way back again bhop lal took charge of horse got in among infantry found half mad with rage that have not be ordered to advance have suffered heavily for cane be poor protection against shot shell many hundred have be killed there learned that order be that whole force be to march towards jhelum at midnight so went back to bhop lal rode till close to old camp then went in on foot to see what be going on be not long before be back again saying that place be entirely deserted that tent have be left standing so rode straight in waited there at daybreak went to river saw that regiment of cavalry be preparing to cross hurried back to tent talked over did not know way have gone might miss if went in search of guessed that must have be dark before set out a have positive order to wait made up mind to do so took off arm laid down on ground sat quietly at door of tent till white cavalry regiment rode up did not feel comfortable for be not sure that must not cut down at once a horse be standing there must have ridden away have chosen hoped must see that be not enemy none of officer must speak punjaubi so after trying to question be handed over to guard other men saw be brought in later be transferred together to dragoon regiment put in tent made prisoner did not feel uncomfortable then for knew that people kill prisoner that must presently be questioned by someone who knew language must be able to explain how came there be terribly anxious about when saw be ready to shout with joy will sahib tell how escaped just a have planned akram rode with for three hour by time be sleepy then slipped over crupper of horse a soon a have passed on hid in scrub then walked back till morning lay down among bush till late in afternoon saw battery of own artillery come along took on to heylah there got horse rode back at once hoping to find here be ten o'clock when arrived too late to make inquiry about then heard that ten prisoner have be taken came over with mr fullarton first thing morning to see if be among chapter xix chillianwalla there be long pause after battle of country between heylah sikh position fifteen mile distant be covered with dense jungle great number of native wood cutter be employed in cutting road through skirmish often took place between sikh regular cavalry patrol on th of december sher singh moved ten thousand men to dingee a movement threatened wuzeerabad ford force be despatched there to bar passage if effected must have placed sher singh between british force lahore sikh retired again nothing be done until th of january when british force concentrated at lussoore be known that considerable reinforcement have joined sher singh among being two troop of horse artillery from peshawur battery have be disciplined by british officer have be presented to chuttur singh by resident at lahore to enable to repel attack of afghan be in respect exactly similar to used in company service be most valuable addition to sher singh strength during six week have elapsed since battle percy have be kept busily employed at one time buying provision at questioning villager a to route obstacle to be encountered gathering a much information a possible a to sikh position at russool description obtained be vague in extreme united in describing country a excessively difficult being covered with jungle abounding in deep nullah will be different business altogether grove from former attack on sikh position said mr fullarton must think much easier sir there have to go right across open with fifty sixty cannon ten twelve thousand infantry blazing away at to storm place difficult to climb where be exposed to fire while be sheltered fighting in jungle have just a good chance a have except grove that will know foot of ground will know nothing of make difference in world doe make difference doubt mr fullarton see turned out of jungle at moodkee quickly enough be true there cavalry got round behind doubt that shook resistance very much nothing alarm undisciplined troop so much a belief that retreat be cut off with highly disciplined troop be just contrary when know must either conquer be destroyed will fight more obstinately than on other occasion to morrow morning move forward to dingee expect that will fight on following day for be not more than eight mile from there at dingee pathan deserter from sikh camp came in from further particular than have before be learned be obtained camp said be round village of russool mile from river in front of be ravine hundred of foot deep almost impassable upon ground on other side of ravine sikh have erected long line of intrenchment to reach have to cross ravine from camp on narrow wooden footbridge thrown over at council of war held on evening of arrival of army at dingee be determined that attempt must be made to outflank sikh intrenchment to attack russool on sikh left so to intercept retreat to river successful gun magazine store must be captured although doubtless infantry must escape through jungle next morning troop be put in motion for time marched without difficulty a jungle have be cut for after movement be slow several pathan deserter came in a advanced gave information a to route position after march of mile halt be made troop ate of food carried in haversack allowance of grog be served out direction of line of march have hitherto be direct upon height of russool where sikh camp be plainly visible be now changed sweeping round reached long bare hill in front of village of chillianwalla turning out sikh who be stationed in small intrenchment there lord gough intention be to encamp for night at spot where plenty of water be obtainable so that troop must rest prepare for fight in morning when whole day must be available for operation ground be marked out for different regiment to occupy men be in act of falling out when large body of men be seen distance in front several gun opened fire sikh have left intrenchment be drawn up in jungle battery after battery opened fire british artillery at once responded while troop fell into rank again lord gough issued order for battle to begin have be blamed by many for so doing be difficult to see how must have be avoided sikh army be at hand in full force be out of question to retreat equally out of question to remain passive under fire of enemy inaction retreat must equally have be interpreted a evidence of fear must have vastly encouraged enemy troop although tired by march through jungle under sun have not have long day work that disposition for battle be hurried incomplete faulty be undeniable that must have taken place be under circumstance inevitable din of cannonade be prodigious echoed a be by surrounding hill sikh battery be almost invisible british artilleryman directed fire solely at flash smoke rising from jungle position of infantry be equally hidden be only by sparkle of sun on bayonet spearhead that indication of line be obtainable having determined upon attacking be necessary that plan of operation must be decided upon specific object of attack assigned to of commanding officer of division brigade such order be given without instruction beyond order to advance capture enemy gun british force numbering eighteen thousand of whom small proportion be white troop there being four regiment of english infantry three of cavalry moved forward to attack force estimated at forty thousand with sixty two gun entirely hidden in jungle in exceedingly broken difficult ground two infantry division of major general gilbert brigadier general colin campbell advanced boldly to attack plunging into jungle be at once engaged in hand to hand struggle with sikh cavalry on right flank consisting of th royal lancer th dragoon two regiment of native cavalry be ordered to advance be commanded by lieutenant colonel pope officer of native cavalry be unfortunately in such infirm health that must not mount horse without assistance have experience whatever of command of brigade of cavalry result be that owing partly to difficulty of keeping straight line in jungle force not only overlapped troop of horse artillery placed between gilbert division got in front of gilbert infantry gun be therefore unable to afford assistance moving forward at walk cavalry found opposed by infantry cavalry colonel pope be wounded severely in head troop being without order faced about in different direction a fresh opponent appeared presently came to halt sikh cavalry boldly skirmished up to then under belief that order have be given to retreat cavalry turned galloped back hotly pursued by sikh in retreat rode right over battery of horse artillery disorganizing gunner carrying off horse in rush while sikh of whom there be handful following hard in rear of flying trooper cut down artilleryman captured six gun continued pursuit until close to lord gough head quarter staff then couple of gun judiciously placed opened upon fell back checked by appearance of couple of squadron of lancer have be rallied by officer have cavalry when first came in contact with enemy received order to charge result must probably have be altogether different indeed colonel of one of cavalry regiment requested permission from pope to charge be refused men who fled thus precipitately have shown almost reckless valour at ramnuggar must under other circumstance have distinguished equally here cavalry at walk be most defenceless of troop broken up a be by jungle unable to see what be going on on side exposed to fire from hidden foe feeling that be badly handled be not surprising that when came to halt be liable to turn go about with alacrity at first sound of retreating hoof at portion of line while be happening battery of horse artillery with squadron of cavalry from three of regiment engaged have most gallantly repulsed attack of large body of enemy horse on extreme left godby brigade of infantry have be deprived of chance of taking part in battle of sadoolapore be first of infantry to come in contact with enemy advance be assisted by well directed fire of horse artillery battery prepared way plunged into jungle with cheer dashing forward through obstacle driving defender before came upon open space opposite side of be thickly lined by enemy troop dashed across under tremendous fire of musket artillery fired volley hurled upon sikh who broke fled pursuit be impossible jungle be so thick that none must see ten yard ahead order be given to collect wounded imperative duty for sikh murdered man left behind suddenly a be engaged in work tremendous fire opened upon from rear large body of sikh have worked way through jungle cut off while strong body of cavalry issued into open space charged down upon a quick a thought horse artillery swept gun round loaded with grape poured in fire creating terrible havoc among sikh horse sending flying back into jungle infantry faced about retired steadily be pressed by crowd of enemy then general gilbert who be with brigade gave word second battalion of bengal european turned went at with cheer sikh fought desperately for be swept backward bayoneted in great number three of gun be taken spiked captured by one of native regiment of brigade left brigade of gilbert division be even more severely treated fighting be desperate th captured spiked several gun in sikh intrenchment must carry off only five of for want of horse a still pushed forward brigade be swept with grape musketry th native infantry suffered terribly losing colonel seven other officer three hundred twenty two men killed wounded th native infantry suffered a heavily losing eleven officer two hundred eighty five men killed wounded native regiment lost colour brigade be at length unable to withstand attack directed against fell back pennycuick brigade of colin campbell division be a roughly handled have through blunder other advanced unsupported by artillery order be given by commander that be not to fire to charge enemy gun th european regiment of brigade strongest battalion of force advanced in magnificent order under terrific fire of musketry artillery drove opposition before captured gun opposed to have commenced spiking when of bunnoo regiment lying concealed in brushwood on rising ground behind gun opened tremendous fire of musketry troop be thrown into confusion by sudden attack fell back a did so be literally mown down by enemy fire general pennycuick fell dead son young ensign stood across father body defended until fell dead beside colonel brook be also killed eleven other officer fell ten be wounded either among gun in retreat followed sikh cavalry pressed hard on retiring soldier while musketry artillery swept rank upwards of five hundred men be killed wounded regiment be in fact almost annihilated position brigade attacked be afterwards found to have be strongest along sikh line two native regiment of brigade have advanced in line with th suffered far le severely in retreat effort of sikh being concentrated against white regiment other brigade of division at whose head colin campbell have placed be more fortunate st foot repulsed several desperate attack pouring in heavy volley swept sikh before wheeling round fought way along retook gun from th have be driven capture of gun be however of little avail for a soon a be abandoned sikh managed to draw spike in few minute be again in action two native regiment fought worthily by side of st cavalry on extreme left under general thackwell did good work by checking very large body of sikh horseman squadron of d dragoon charging riding right through then gathering again with desperate effort cut way back to friend two officer thirty six men having be killed wounded in brilliant charge night be now approaching portion of jungle have be for moment cleared beyond sikh still swarmed during battle large body have worked round have only be prevented by fire of gun from falling on rear nothing more must be done of officer advised that force must fall back to village of chillianwalla in order to obtain water to afford protection to baggage lord gough at first refused to do so on ground that wounded left behind must be massacred troop especially sepoys be however so distressed by thirst that wounded be a far a possible collected force concentrated round chillianwalla have enemy attacked at night consequence must have be terrible for regiment be broken up separated confusion be absolute at eight o'clock rain came down in torrent fact that own loss have be severe especially among gunner checked ardour of sikh probably saved british force in morning enemy be seen encamped on eminence three mile distant cavalry scoured field of battle to collect wounded have be left bring in captured gun twelve small cannon however be only trophy of fight roll be called loss ascertained consisted of eighty nine officer two thousand three hundred fifty seven men killed wounded enormous loss in proportion to number of men engaged six gun be lost together with ammunition have accompanied several of corp into fight be so far drawn battle that army at night occupied same position have held at commencement of battle advantage be with sikh for fighting strength of four english regiment have formed backbone of force be lessened by half while sikh have proved to delight that british troop be not always invincible occasionally be even subject to panic result be that confidence be greatly increased loss be far more than balanced by great number of recruit who at news of repulse of british attack poured into sher singh camp british army remained stationary at chillianwalla from th of january to february large number of sikh at various time penetrated to dingee cut line of communication through place there be indeed line open through hayleh where force have be engaged at sadoolapore have remained since battle to prevent sikh from advancing towards lahore regiment have be left behind at ramnuggur rejoined army place being taken by d regiment from lahore general whish force have captured mooltan be now on way to join that of lord gough siege of mooltan have be renewed after departure of sher singh army reinforcement having reached general whish be pushed on with great vigour two breach be effected in wall of fort great mosque be used a magazine by rebel be pierced by shell caused terrific explosion entirely destroying building leaving great chasm where have stood levelling sikh work near killing five hundred men soon after misfortune moolraj finding further resistance impossible came out surrendered unconditionally just a british column be formed up in readiness to storm breach be taken to calcutta there tried be found guilty being considered that have acted under pressure from troop that be unable to resist be sentenced only to imprisonment for life at battle of chillianwalla percy grove have be severely wounded be sitting on horse with mr fullarton two three other political officer at distance of hundred yard from head quarter staff when pope cavalry issued in headlong flight from jungle exclamation of dismay burst from member of little party be regular stampede mr fullarton exclaimed there come sikh after why be comparatively handful what on earth posse men why will be over gun did ever see such madness on came fugitive to right there mr fullarton shouted madman will ride down have just got clear of front when cavalry swept past before must go farther dozen sikh horseman rode at civilian carried pistol used with effect two of sikh fell rest rushed on percy have sword thought that end have come when there be shout two follower rode past fiercely fell upon sikh percy turned round in time to see two of civilian cut down by tulwars of other sikh while mr fullarton tried with pistol to ward off blow aimed at force of blow struck down sword fell on shoulder before sikh have time to strike again be shot by bhop lal latter comrade then attacked remaining two sikh furiously akram chunder ran one through with sword bhop lal seriously wounded other who wheeled horse round fled at full speed moment later there be thunder of hoof lancer who have rallied came dashing down percy furious at seeing mr fullarton fall exclaimed give one of tulwars bhop lal man sprang from horse handed one have fallen from hand of sikh have shot a lancer came along percy with two companion fell in behind rode over many of sikh horseman rest fled be hotly pursued back to jungle many of being cut down impetus of charge took lancer well into wood blaze of musketry flashed out in front of fresh troop of horseman charged down moment later be engaged in hand to hand contest tall sikh rode at percy at once engaged in single combat percy steady training at fortress with sword tulwar be useful to now sikh shield gave advantage be counter balanced by percy being accustomed to thrust a well a strike for time contest be doubtful then after feinting at sikh head to make throw up shield percy ran through body heard warning shout from bhop lal a did so next moment sikh rode at knocking horse off leg while at same moment crashing blow fell on helmet after that remembered nothing when opened eye be dark presently must hear talking round listened heard that language be punjaubi wondered to how have got there then recalled fight gradually recollected horse falling must be wounded said to yes head throb fearfully how be that be here sikh always kill wounded illustration percy take part in battle of chillianwalla made effort to raise on one elbow when felt hand laid on voice recognized a of akram chunder whispered in ear stir sahib thanks to great one have recovered be sure that be not dead blow be heavy one a be falling when struck tulwar did not catch quite fairly helmet helped to turn so that instead of cleaving skull have shaved off portion of scalp half ear how be be here with be fighting sahib knew that must hold own against sikh be engaged with suddenly just a from corner of eye saw that have disposed of rode at gave shout cut down man be fighting with before must turn horse be down shot sikh then bhop lal who have just rid of man leapt off horse intending to lift on to one of at moment lancer began to fall back saw that be too late so seizing under one arm sprang with into bush then while bhop lal stayed with ran out again caught up mantle of sikh who have fallen within yard of bush sprang in again wrapped in mantle then crawled on dragging with into very thick patch of bush where be lying now moment later dozen sikh infantry pushing way through bush came close one of caught sight of cried 'what be doing here comrade brother be sorely wounded ' said 'and have stopped to close eye before go on to have fight with feringhees 'you must make haste then said 'or there will be none of left to fight with ' heard large number of pas along short distance off then volley after volley of grape came crashing through jungle fell back again ' will mix with ' bhop lal said stop with sahib one be le likely to be seen than two story be good enough to account for one if catch sight of be not good enough for two of ' for two hour battle went on not near again banging of cannon musket be a bad a at ferozeshah sometimes thought one side be winning sometimes other sometimes must hear sikh yell of triumph sometimes deep roar even above din of musketry knew that be english cheer for have heard before occasionally men came along having strayed from party told different story said that many of cannon have be captured by feringhees others declared that feringhees be almost destroyed bhop lal sat down only ten twelve yard away must hear talking to presently heard ask have anyone water ' have wounded comrade somewhere not far off in jungle want for ' somebody lent water gourd went off behind minute later worked round here with must not come straight for of might have followed into bush to see if must do anything for comrade be not likely for there be score of wounded men round here however tore off rag wetted laid on wound poured little of into water flask to sprinkle face drop between lip from time to time then bhop lal went back again with remainder how have battle ended akram have ended just a began white troop have gone up to chillianwalla other village there sikh hold jungle captured six of gun cavalry rode over have lost twelve small one hear that almost gunner be killed for british took several of battery though must not hold know sahib sikh will never leave gun will stand by till be cut down men about here know what be going to be done say that will attack to morrow others say that though have shown that be more than match for feringhees must be too much to attack in own position especially a have not enough gunner to work piece perhaps will attack in morning akram think so sahib say that one of white regiment have scarcely man left that others have lost strength general sahib be great man for fighting must see that until get more troop can never force way through jungle up to russool there be presently sound of someone forcing way through bush then voice said bring order that be to fall back be not that be beaten a everyone know have won great victory have taught feringhees that be not invincible food water can not be brought down here therefore must go up get food drink rest for night feringhees have have enough will not attack again to morrow morning if do will come down again welcome there be murmur of satisfaction for sikh have taken up position hour before british attacked be eager for food a although spirit have be freely served out supply of food in camp be small many have eaten nothing day bhop lal moved off with others in five minute be back again a in dark be unable to find clump of bush in percy be hidden akram called to in low voice how be sahib bhop lal asked a pushed way in be better percy answered have saved life between have gone can walk sahib there be number of wounded lying about there be nothing to prevent starting off now think that can walk yet percy said perhaps in little time may be able to do so be afraid not sahib that make difference can carry easily akram do stoop down on one side will do so on other now sahib put arm round neck will clasp hand under can sit then a in chair percy be able to give little assistance felt lifted up held firmly then slowly steadily two men carried through jungle once twice be

chunder said have better take on again be from loss of blood have fainted must get to camp first will again try to bandage wound unwound several yard of muslin from turban bound up percy head then lifted went forward time at faster pace than before for there be now fear of giving percy pain have to be careful however ground be crossing be that over cavalry have retreated be thickly dotted with body of fallen once past pressed rapidly up slope to chillianwalla to surprise approached unchallenged for have be afraid that reply in native tongue must have brought shot from sentry such be confusion so exhausted be men while regiment have thrown out sentry others have not done so be fortunate in having come upon unguarded spot little farther entered village number of men be lying asleep

then struck off along foot of hill on way to fortress thirty mile off at rawal pindee heard that uncle have ridden in with two hundred horseman on arrival of general gilbert at town have placed troop at general disposal be however occasion for service afghan having already evacuated district of peshawur there being no longer sikh force under arm sufficient to offer resistance to british column

singh a learnt when be prisoner while on other hand lent money to people when needed for purchasing provision be not until just before gujerat when saw that there be longer least doubt side must prove triumphant that really put troop in motion offered to act in way might be required against sikh however know now that there be possibility of ever getting foothold across jhelum be certain that in week two will hear that whole of punjaub be annexed by england uncle might pay visit at serinagur without least fear that must receive in courteous hospitable manner djama be a good a british territory now daresay uncle have got british flag waving over fortress already indian government have reason either to like trust ghoolab if gave cause have only to stretch out hand to take cashmere must be best thing must happen for country said akram then people must be able to till field weave shawl in peace quiet afraid neither of foreign invader of oppressive ruler a approached fortress must see flag waving over highest point thought uncle must have up percy exclaimed be too far away to see colour be sure what be percy rode fast now walked up long hill then galloped to gate be open drawbridge down waved hand to men who saluted a rode in kept on without drawing rein until sprang from horse at step where uncle who have be warned of approach stood waiting to meet welcome back percy welcome back be eleven month since rode out have doubt gone through much though have heard nothing of there be mean of sending letter uncle have often thought of wondered how have be getting on sent three letter off percy did get none of none uncle know nothing of what have happened since have be away nothing percy repeated struck by uncle grave face nothing serious have happened hope come in colonel said taking arm leading into private apartment percy looked round expecting to see ranee appear be gone lad gone uncle ay lad died ten month ago month after left percy stood aghast dear uncle how sorry be never dreamt of such home coming a poor aunt what terrible loss for terrible lad be getting over now for time be crushed indeed for day be at death door only pulled through by god mercy why what be uncle fever poison lad poison uncle percy repeated horror struck be what be boy ghoolab work again have doubt though can not prove must to heaven must for must ride to serinagur with hundred men force way into presence if need be accuse of deed blow out brain have not shadow of proof happened a told month maybe six week after have left news have come of rising at mooltan murder of agnew anderson be in great anxiety about knowing be with mahtab especially a told have be killed also must have heard of that be not sort of fellow to be caught in trap have doubt have got out of somehow day two after said to 'you must be especially careful now roland ghoolab have hand in trouble take place in punjaub doubt will do a did before play one side against other send promise to hing until see how matter go will think that at rate if there be war strife will be free to do a like up here in north will likely enough try once again to encompass life ' felt that be probable enough kept more vigilant guard than usual one day after dining be taken suddenly ill two hour later be dead pulled through looked death very closely in face did find out who murderer be uncle boy have found out now be sure a to mover in plot not a to instrument found a soon a have recovered that cook other servant have be seized caged up have died doubt must have be tortured put to death officer knew well enough to feel sure must be angry at did recover have ground for suspicion against one more than cross questioned cook closely beyond protesting innocence must get nothing out of have cooked dinner a usual be not a said time standing over pot of other servant might while back be turned while bringing thing up from cool cellar a required have dropped poison into cooking pot there be denying other servant with equal vehemence protested innocence officer wanted to use torture must not hear of might have tortured dozen innocent men before came to guilty one besides having englishman abhorrence of such mean must not rely on anything wrung from man weak man while be in agony will acknowledge anything required of will confess crime will accuse anyone while guilty one of stronger nerve will die protesting innocence be examined closely none must say that saw stranger be anyone outside household enter kitchen a at time room seems to have be entirely empty anyone might have slipped in unperceived since then have suspected one uncle one percy none of servant have left be still with have kept still about yes appeared so utterly distressed broken down at death of mistress at suspicion rested upon must not bring to discharge indeed so great be fury of people throughout whole district that believe have turned out through gate life must have be sacrificed besides how must rely upon fresh set of servant more than upon who have be with long who apparently cared for moreover there be certainty one of must suspect others that must make effort to find out one by whose deed suspicion disgrace have fallen upon must naturally watch other a cat mouse kitchen must never be left empty again there must be at least two in must be next to impossible for attempt to be repeated unseen cook might indeed have slipped poison into curry other dish before compounding be convinced that be assassin be not cook for must have known suspicion must fall upon have died torture death be certain then think that be someone outside house uncle say that percy only say that suspect one after discovery that rascally steward shot be traitor can never feel sure of anyone therefore may have be one of servant may have be one of soldier may have be stranger inside gate at rate fresh attempt have be made be time percy before got to enjoy food again chapter xxi retired percy have felt hungry when rode into fortress although saw uncle eat a heartily a usual appetite seemed to desert ate very sparingly of dish placed before uncle smiled be not such good trencher man a be percy oh be right uncle just at first thought that of dish may be poisoned be unpleasant one will get over in time frankly think that there be ground for uneasiness from day gough crossed sutlej felt safe from day gujerat be won have felt absolutely at ease have no longer slightest fear of ghoolab district be part of punjaub punjaub will assuredly be annexed to british india yes uncle say proclamation will be out in fortnight so that being so lad ghoolab game be finally up did die to morrow surely nominee of must obtain appointment of governor people call of district adjoining cashmere may not like may owe grudge for thwarting so long have no longer slightest interest in death although ghoolab must without scruple remove hundred men who stood in way must not run slightest risk there be always certain risk of tool turning traitor when there be nothing whatever to be gained by hear that rode into rawal pindee to meet general gilbert column a came through yes took cavalry over by time got there opposition have ceased sirdar be pouring in to make submission beg for forgiveness so there be occasion for service of course thanked said that must report offer almost thought might come down join uncle thought over lad there might have be trouble here in absence thought must keep force together so that if there must be tough fighting in north must be able to march away horse foot to join men did not calculate upon so complete sudden collapse of sikh now have talked enough about be time that tell story of adventure of a yet know nothing how came by desperately ugly wound on head be late before percy finished story of adventure have have great luck lad to have got so well out of scrape colonel said well be late now must be off to bed will have plenty of time to talk matter over in morning must think uncle percy said when have lighted cigar after breakfast that government will recognize position grant same power over district that sirdar have over estate else that will appoint a official over district have doubt must do so percy be willing to accept have quite made up mind to give up go home have uncle percy exclaimed in surprise yes have stuck here year for three reason first because be obstinate beggar must not be turned out secondly because wife must not have liked to leave native land must never have be happy in england thirdly because people of district have be rich prosperous under be not going to hand over to be pillaged robbed by one of sikh harpy now however case be altogether changed if go go of own free will choosing mahtab have gone there be longer anything to tie to india lastly can with confidence hand over district to english administrator secure that people will not be taxed unfairly will be safe from oppression extortion during last two year have reduced force here considerably be certain that after lesson gave there be fear of ever again making open assault on place began by not filling up vacancy caused by death from men being superannuated fortunately there be good deal of cultivable land down valley indeed in other part of district have given grant of small holding to who be willing to take discharge noticed that there be great change in valley below since went away uncle that field have be marked out that there be quite village down where sikh be encamped when besieged yes over two hundred holding have be taken up there granted free of tax for first three year gave men who have saving little assistance in way of loan in time there will be large hope thriving village there have urged men to keep up certain organization among to form in fact kind of military colony so a to be in position to resist dacoit attack by marauding hill tribe have similarly settled that other valley three mile to north altogether have given start to nearly thousand of men have served faithfully nothing must induce to go away abandon think that be very likely force may be formed by people for protection of frontier a mr fullarton with whom have have good deal of correspondence lawrence be aware that men have behaved most faithfully can be trusted hope will be able to get who wish to continue soldiering to be mustered into service must think might manage uncle one other of lawrence perhaps be certain to be appointed commissioner of punjaub of course be not in position to speak to on subject be sure mr fullarton must do so did not see after be wounded a before be about have be taken down to lahore heard that be recovering fast be expected to rejoin head quarter camp in short time having be so long on frontier must think probably will get large district here at rate must be sure bring matter before lawrence must think by mean improbable percy that may appoint district magistrate collector call of district be if keep a district must think be not likely to do uncle rawal pindee will be made must say centre of district of will form part still possibly may be appointed assistant in district a know country people so well if so will follow up method have made in hand most flourishing little corner of punjaub in spite of greater part of being merely hill country well percy think can do better than stick to have got splendid start in service have chance of rising in rapidly be good for to work exciting scene have passed through during last four year have be good preparation for making active efficient officer what want to say be if health fails if sooner later marry must like to settle down at home if from other cause want to leave service remember there be occasion for to work for living be rich man thank god owe wealth to grinding last penny out of native must have retired lived more than comfortably in england have chosen to do so when runjeet singh died for old lion with fault be most liberal of master to who served well since then have of course largely increased mean have to pay fixed sum annually to lahore revenue of district have multiplied by ten since took charge of must therefore give income sufficient to keep comfortably at home during lifetime will of course come to at death still much a must like to have with think that at rate must be better for to remain in service of company for year be bad thing for man to have nothing to do there be better training than afforded by civil service of company thank very much uncle like service greatly so far a have seen of must certainly wish to remain in even if did not like india must do so think that man with health strength ought to have career not to owe everything to however close relation may be certainly hope to be appointed to punjaub must think there must always be spice of excitement here there be sure to be constant trouble with afghan hill tribe round have be awfully lucky in getting noticed so young so gaining at least eight ten year start of fresh comer of own age from england feel above thing how indebted to be for be indebted to that came out to india percy almost everything else be due to yourself turning point in career be when sat down on board ship to take first lesson in punjaubi be steadfastness with stuck to study during voyage won for liking patronage of mr fullarton so enabled to take part in sutlej campaign there showed pluck presence of mind so gained attention of sir henry hardinge of commander in chief after that be fact that have got up pathan procured for early appointment nomination to accompany agnew have not be for must have be out of last business have done what little must in way of teaching to ride well use weapon have given best advice must beyond everything have depended on feel proud of lad very proud of only wish mahtab have be here to share satisfaction be a fond of lad a if have be mother life here have be altogether different since lost sorest point of be thought that blow struck be aimed at know that must feel that uncle can quite understand wanting to get away from here now percy did not take whole of leave uncle be restless unsettled when week later news came of annexation of punjaub percy said why must stop uncle sooner be away better care to stay here longer place be not same a be besides can not help feeling just at present time must be better for to be at head quarter there be nothing like being on spot when change be being made think be right there lad have be telling officer what said about trying to get into company employment have expressed willingness to remain in district hold in readiness to join must receive message from have eight hundred men left now have given to be understood that will give fifty rupee when be disbanded grant of land large enough to keep have doubt grant will be confirmed a authority will be glad enough to see body of men who might be troublesome if turned adrift settle down a cultivator so adding to revenue well there be nothing to stay for will put in order evening a whole country have now be taken over by british government force will be disbanded to morrow next day troop paraded for last time colonel made little speech thanking for fidelity have shown expressing deep regret at leaving told that if force must be raised by british for service on frontier nephew must endeavour to procure enrolment in rank for such of a desired that have set aside tract of land for that nand chund have authority to divide fairly among that a token of appreciation of faithful service have directed fifty rupee to be given to man in addition to pay due to that vakeel be writing for paper testifying to service must sign must find useful in dealing with british official when have finished men broke rank crowded round tear flowing down most of face calling down blessing upon pouring out regret at leaving service of so good kind master be with difficulty that colonel who be deeply affected extricated from returned to residence next morning percy started colonel have made very handsome present to bhop lal akram chunder of course accompanied in addition whole of cavalry mounted formed voluntary escort to a far a rawal pindee travelling quietly reached head quarter on day when proclamation be read to troop amid booming of cannon announcing to punjaub that be now integral portion of british india percy introduced uncle to mr fullarton latter took to sir henry lawrence with whom during stay of week in british camp have several long conversation chief commissioner being desirous of ascertaining view of one of such long experience in country colonel grove be strongly of opinion that henceforth there must be no more trouble in punjaub sikh power be altogether broken said former danger to india existed in fact that hitherto have be so successful in war that have come to consider almost invincible that great army runjeet have got together be demoralized by inactivity man thirsted for opportunity to distinguish dreamt of share in plunder of india population in general be in opinion peace loving industrious have suffered terribly under exaction of grasping sirdar who amassed fortune out of toil of tax gatherer who have to collect vast sum for maintenance of army that army have ceased to exist gujerat chillianwalla have accounted for greater part of who have escaped ferozeshah sobraon believe said that in course of generation there will be no more orderly loyal province than punjaub there will be always certain number of restless adventurous spirit for there will in time presume be opening in regiment when feel that can trust will be raised here a in other part of india there be finer fighting material to be found than among sikh fidelity with have fought to last for country be earnest of will show to colour when once take pride in then instanced conduct of own men who have proved faithful to throughout have fought a bravely against sikh force a have formerly done under sikh flag be for most part said men of hill tribe pathan rather than sikh by blood must be raising force for defence of frontier against afghan hill men must find admirably suited to service be already well drilled accustomed to discipline promised when disbanded other day must speak to in favour must guarantee fidelity must be admitted into company service will think matter over sir henry lawrence said force of kind if must be relied upon must be of immense service well sir henry there be one ready at hand if might venture to suggest must say if nephew happens to have appointment in punjaub must be useful must go for week two to district with officer charged to raise force in few day must produce squadron two hundred strong of well drilled cavalry four five hundred infantry with complement of native officer thoroughly up to work nephew will certainly have appointment in punjaub colonel grove have proved most efficient zealous officer knowledge of punjaubi pathan of country must be thrown away in other province have early record in hand when be resident at lahore major edwardes have written very strongly of valuable assistance mr grove rendered have be very useful during late campaign can promise that appointment will show that service have be thoroughly appreciated consider exceedingly promising young officer will be glad to have assistant on whom can so thoroughly rely in emergency there be one thing want to say to sir be that when disbanded regiment gave to man grant of acre two of land in valley so far untilled good land capable of irrigation have previously planted thousand of in two similar colony of be doing well hope that grant may be confirmed that certainly must in case colonel grove be great thing to have so many men who might otherwise be troublesome settled on land indeed a grant be made previous to formal annexation must in case remain good at end of week colonel grove left camp took boat to go down indus short stay among countryman from whom have be for many year separated have done good dispelled melancholy thought with have ridden down from fortress have be for twelve year home have met with great hospitality during stay in camp for be interested in talk adventure of one who have be among best known of runjeet singh officer hearty genial manner have won for liking of who met ten day later percy who be getting somewhat tired of idleness received message saying that be to appear before commissioner on following day sir henry a president addressed when
