minute day benefit of skill must like to have bout with master holliday monsieur dalboy said will take foil be curious to see what united teaching of countryman that noted swordsman colonel holliday may have done to a master be interesting to discover what be possible with good teacher when science be begun young what may age be master holliday be four month short of sixteen rupert said will be very proud of honour of crossing sword with so famed master a if think worthy of so great privilege there be quite sensation in fencing school round be gathered forty fifty of young men of day when maitre dalboy called for plastron foil for be seldom indeed then only with swordsman of altogether exceptional strength monsieur dalboy condescended to fence contenting ordinarily with walking about school giving hint now then to fencing with assistant not perhaps more than once week taking foil in hand to illustrate thrust guard be inculcating at call therefore there be general silence everyone turned to see who be fencer whom great master thus signally deigned to honour great be astonishment when a monsieur dalboy divested of coat vest lad who have entered with lord fairholm sir john loveday be seen similarly to prepare for contest who be what singular freak be of maitre to take up foil with boy be question ran round room several of present have met rupert holliday must give name none must account for freak on part of master fortunately rupert be unacquainted with fact that what seemed to natural occurrence be extraordinary event in eye of assembled therefore experienced feeling of nervousness knew that colonel holliday be master of sword grandfather have told that monsieur dessin be altogether exceptional swordsman a knew to be fully match for latter felt sure that however perfect master monsieur dalboy might be need not fear discrediting master even if present opponent must prove more than match there be dead silence of curiosity at singularity of affair a rupert holliday took post face to face with master murmur of surprise admiration ran round room at grace perfection of accuracy with rupert went through various parade be then customary before combatant crossed sword rupert felt a calm a steady a when fencing at home determined to use caution a well a skill for not only did feel that own strength be upon trial that honour of teacher who have taken such pain with be concerned in result sword have scarcely crossed when expression of surprise passed across maitre dalboy face first few pass showed that in lad have found opponent of ordinary character that skill must be needed to obtain victory over for first few minute fought cautiously feeling other strength rather than attempting to attack seriously then master dropped point ma foi young sir have done monsieur le colonel compatriot justice offer congratulation be premature sir rupert said smiling have not a yet begun silence in school be even more profound when sword again crossed than have be when bout began for wonder have now taken place of amused curiosity struggle now commenced in earnest several time at first rupert narrowly escaped being touched for master play be new to thrust feint various attack be familiar whereas colonel holliday have fought simply with arm head standing immovably in one place monsieur dessin have although quick to advance fall back fought comparatively on defensive while have be assailant from superior activity monsieur dalboy be a quick a active a rapidity of attack quick bound swift rush at first almost bewildered gradually a grew accustomed to play steadied eluded master attack with activity a great a own in vain monsieur dalboy employed feint combination in repertoire rupert be always prepared for from one other of teacher have defence to be employed against at last a master exhausted with exertion flagged little rupert in turn took offensive now monsieur dalboy skill stood in equal stead to defend against rupert rapid attack lightning like pass thrust although combat have lasted without second interruption for nearly quarter of hour combatant have touched other at last rupert saw by opponent eye that new special combination be about to be put into action against instantly steadied to resist came with rapidity of thought rupert recognized by first pas a very last combination monsieur dessin have taught assuring at time that must find irresistible for there be not three men in europe acquainted with met attack then with defence monsieur dessin have showed to be sure escape ending with wrench nearly tore sword from hand of opponent monsieur dalboy sprang back on guard with look of profound astonishment then throwing down foil threw in impetuous manner of countryman on rupert neck embraced mon dieu mon dieu exclaimed be incroyable be miracle gentleman said turning to present when burst of enthusiastic applause greeted conclusion of extraordinary contest subsided see in young gentleman one of finest swordsman in europe say finest for have not touched having idea of force extended rashly at first may say be equal never once have crossed sword with fencer doubt if even be a strong parry to last attack be miraculous be coup invented by brought to perfection with one speak of believed one else knew have ever reserved for last extremity defence even to last wrench must have disarmed other man even have not known that must have come then be perfect be astounding maitre of yours monsieur dessin went on turning to rupert must be wonder ah said suddenly a if to c'est bien possible what be like monsieur dessin be tall slight except a to shoulder where be very broad have little scar here have not fencing master said pointing to temple yes rupert said surprised have often noticed then be monsieur dalboy said swordsman of whom spoke wonder parried coup have wondered what have become of know a monsieur dessin teach fencing yes rupert said grandfather always said

broadsword here must not on account that one thought be quarrelsome swordster know really be not have be purely misfortune have be thrust into thing have never told of comrade that have killed man that dalboy proclaimed in salle to be one of finest blade in europe indeed rupert said why must sir john well can say be rupert admire modesty a much a skill there be few fellow of age of mine must hector little on strength of such reputation think that must cock hat point moustache little more fiercely if knew be cock of whole walk rupert smiled think must sir john especially if be a young a be

directed against fort saint michael at opposite side of river connected by bridge of boat to town on th breach be increasing rapidly in size be whispered that assault must be made on evening of th soon after dusk will be difficult bloody business captain lauriston said a sat in tent that evening garrison of fort saint michael be only reinforcement will of course pour in from town directly attack begin may be more than men can do to win place remember how heavily german suffered in attack on covered way of kaiserwerth must think best thing to do must be to break down bridge of boat before beginning attack lieutenant dillon remarked yes must be excellent plan if must be carried out none of gun command might launch boat with straw combustible from above rupert said burn may be very sure that have got chain across river above bridge to prevent attempt of kind captain lauriston said presently captain who be on duty went out for round rupert who have be sitting thoughtfully said look here dillon be good swimmer seems to that must be easy enough to put two three petard on plank noticed wood on bank above town yesterday to float down to bridge to fasten to two three of boat so to break bridge cousin in engineer must manage to get petard what do say young irishman looked at lad in astonishment be talking seriously asked certainly why not 'd laugh in face if be to volunteer dillon said must volunteer must just go do yes after be done instead of getting praise be if be killed 'd be simply told have right to undertake such affair must never say anything about rupert said must just do because must be good thing to do must save life of of grenadier who will likely enough lead assault besides must be adventure like other dillon looked at for time be curious fellow holliday must agree to join in matter can not swim stroke pat dillon care a little for life a man after there be more danger in than in going out in duel must do without thinking twice well will try rupert said quietly hugh can swim a well a can will take can get petard dare say must manage dillon said entering into scheme with irishman love of excitement think must go too though ca swim must stick tight to plank know rupert said seriously must not do may be detected may have to dive sort of thing dillon must not do if can get petard will have satisfaction of knowing that have done share of work then might if must ride round in evening with uniform hugh in valise if go on to bank mile so below town one will be watching assault can get ashore put on clothes get back home without soul being wiser suppose be killed pooh will not be killed rupert said will leave letter can find in morning if come back saying have undertaken adventure in hope of benefiting majesty arm do without asking permission that hope that going beyond duty will be forgiven in consideration have died in majesty service next day at two o'clock lieutenant dillon who have be away for hour beckoned to rupert that wanted to speak to apart have seen cousin gerald will not let have petard unless know for what purpose be to be used said a much a must without betraying intention think guessed for said 'look here pat if there be fun adventure on hand will make free with gracious majesty petard on condition that be in ' be up to fun of kind gerald be can know swim like fish what do say will tell do by mean rupert said have warned hugh of what be going to do must never forgive if did not take if cousin will go better for will know far better than how to fix petard can tell will be glad to act under order if succeeds like to let be known part have played in matter indeed must seem to be within scope of proper duty being engineer will be glad for to do so always being understood that doe not mention name in way hour later dillon entered to say that cousin agreed heartily to take part in adventure that must shortly come up to arrange detail with rupert rupert have met gerald dillon before knew to be a wild adventurous harum scarum young officer a cousin pat in hour talk whole matter be settled gerald must take two petard weighed twenty pound to tent one by one hugh must fetch in basket one by

necessary a course under circumstance have be already agreed to petard other object be placed on boom upon rupert a lightest of party crept holding in hand cord fastened round log hugh gerald dillon now climbed upon one end of log at once sank into water below level of bottom of boom current taking swept beneath obstacle rupert rope directed downward course be soon alongside boom on lower side petard be replaced party again proceeded now hugh swam on back holding short rope attached to one end so a to keep log straight prevent getting across mooring chain of boat forming bridge while rupert gerald with rope also attached to log floated down ten twelve yard on side of log little behind plan answered admirably stream carried log end foremost between two of boat be moored twelve foot apart while gerald rupert floated on other side of mooring chain of boat round chain twisted rope by log lay anchored a be under bridge between two of boat forming if there be sentry on bridge saw heard attention being absorbed by expectation of attack upon breach of fort saint michael party now set to work with gimlet hole be made couple of foot above water in hook be inserted from petard be suspended by rope so a to lie against side of boat inch only above water level fuse be inserted being now in readiness for blowing hole in side of two boat regained log awaited signal time passed slowly a church clock of town struck eleven sudden outburst of musketry broke out round saint michael in instant cannon of fort roared out bell clanged alarm blue fire be lighted dead silence be succeeded by perfect chaos of sound party under bridge waited quietly until noise a of large body of men coming upon bridge from town end be heard at first outbreak gerald dillon have with difficulty lit first tinder then slow match from flint steel of article having be most carefully kept dry during trip with two pistol be intended to fire fuse must flint steel fail to produce light a sound of

of liege most important town fortress whose possession must give to ally command of meuse maas into very heart of flanders marshal boufflers ever watching movement of marlborough suspected that liege must be next object of attack accordingly reconnoitred ground round that city fixed on position must thought serve admirably for establishment of permanent camp news be however brought to marlborough who broke up camp same night when french army approached liege found ally established on very ground marshal have selected for camp unsuspecting presence of english french came on in order of march until within cannon shot of ally splendid opportunity be thus given to marlborough to attack main body of enemy under most advantageous circumstance dutch deputy again interposed veto english have mortification of seeing enemy again escape from hand however there be now nothing to prevent undertaking siege of liege on th of october regular investment of place be formed strength of liege consisted in citadel fort of chatreuse strongly fortified town wealthy city so abounding in church that be called little rome be defended only by single wall must clearly offer defence against

of hugh who lost hold footing at axle must have hurt greatly have not rupert caught boy falling with crash in bottom of wheel be little time before regaining foot for be much hurt movement be however accelerated by water fell in heavy shower from above through leak in bucket of wheel be hurt much master rupert think be broken at hugh be hurt over how be be right think be lucky inside of wheel be pretty smooth like big drum position be not pleasant one heavy shower of water from above filled air with spray with head bent down be difficult to breathe inside plank of wheel be so slimy that standing be almost impossible at slightest attempt at movement fell above flame be already darting out through window side of mill do not think might crawl out between wheel wall make way down tail race master rupert water be chilling to bone think safer to stop where be hugh fellow be sure to be on watch will expect to see jump out of upper window last thing will wait to throw body for of course must be killed into flame to hide trace of have only to wait quietly here be not pleasant after trouble have have to save life must be pity to risk again have very particular desire to be even with fellow who be doubt not at bottom of soon flame be rushing out in great sheet from mill even in wheel heat of atmosphere be considerable presently great crash be heard inside there be floor fallen rupert said think may move now fellow will have made off secure that hullo what be that exclamation be caused by sudden creaking noise great wheel began slowly to revolve fall of floor have broken connection with machinery in mill left free at once yielded to weight of water in bucket supply of water coming down be small wheel stiff from long disuse therefore moved slowly motion however threw lad from foot once down rotatory motion rendered impossible for to regain foot after first cry of surprise spoke across mind rushed certainty of death how long terrible time followed lasted of ever knew sensation be that of being pounded to death at one moment be together then separated now rolling over over in sort of ball then lifted up cast down into bottom of wheel with crash now with head highest now with foot be like terrible nightmare gradually sharp pain of blow fall be le vivid dull sensation came over lost consciousness rupert be first to open eye for time lay in dreamy wonder a to where be what have happened seemed to be lying under great penthouse with red glow pervading everything gradually thought took shape remembered what have passed struggling painfully into sitting position looked round wheel no longer revolved there be longer constant splash of water indeed wheel existed a wheel no longer a looked round truth lighted upon burning mill have fallen across wheel crushing at top side together massive timber have given further wheel formed sort of roof sloping from outer wall built solidly up against to opposite foot above timber of wall glared flickered soddened timber of wheel must have resisted far greater amount of heat leet have of course be carried away with fall water must be flowing down valley heat be very great rush of air up deep cut of mill race rendered bearable having once grasped fact a doubted not fall must have occurred soon after lost consciousness so saved from being bruised to death rupert turned to hugh be quite insensible heart still beat rupert crawled out of wheel found pool of water in mill race from brought double handful sprinkled hugh face then a grew stronger from fresh air copious dousing of face head with water dragged out laying beside pool dashed water on face chest deep sigh be first symptom of returning consciousness soon to rupert delight opened eye after time sat up be too much hurt to rise after consultation rupert left went alone down to hamlet of dettinheim where after much knocking roused of inhabitant who have only short time before returned from burning mill sodden discoloured a be rupert uniform be still recognizable by authority conveyed promise of ample reward four men be induced to return with to mill carry hugh down to village reached just a distant clock of liege cathedral struck two bed be given up to in hour lad be sound asleep chapter duel great be excitement in th dragoon when upon arrival of rupert former of whom be able to ride latter be carried by on stretcher learned attack have be made upon one of officer little cornet be general favourite short a be time since have joined while hugh be greatly liked by men of own troop rupert colonel at once sent for to learn particular of outrage rupert be unable to give farther particular a to assailant than that be german soldier much dim light have permitted to see more than that must not say stated reason for believing sir richard fulke be originator of attack since have have quarrel with in england owned that beyond suspicion have proof colonel at once rode down to headquarters laid complaint before earl of athlone who promised that must cause inquiry to be made then general commanding hesse contingent be communicated with colonel of cavalry regiment to sir richard fulke belonged be sent for stated that captain fulke have be away on leave of absence for three day that have gone to england regiment be however paraded be found that five trooper be missing inquiry however must elicit from of others confession that have be engaged in fray a be reported a having be in by ten o'clock except five missing men there be clue a to party engaged five men might have deserted ground for suspicion be very strong still a proof must be obtained matter be suffered to drop affair caused however much bad feeling between two regiment men engaged in affray when met until order be issued that must only be allowed leave into town on alternate day ill feeling spread however beyond regiment concerned there have already be good deal of jealousy upon part of continental troop of honour gained by british in being first in at breach of venloo liege feeling be now much embittered duel between officer became matter of frequent occurrence in spite of strict order issued against practice a rupert have anticipated letter by have be entrapped turned out forgery lord fairholm be extremely indignant when heard use have be made of name at once made inquiry a to trooper who have carried note to rupert man found without difficulty upon being questioned stated that have just returned from carrying message when be accosted by german officer who offered couple of mark to carry letter up to officer of th dragoon thinking that there be harm in doing so have at once accepted offer upon being asked if must recognize officer if saw replied that have scarcely noticed face did not think that must pick out from others first three four duel took place have not be attended with fatal result about three week after occurrence of attack on rupert captain muller who have be away on leave returned publicly announced intention of avenging insult to regiment by insulting killing one of officer of th dragoon report of threat caused uneasiness among officer for fellow reputation a swordsman notorious duellist be so well known that be felt that one whom might select a antagonist must be a good a dead man proposition be started to report matter to general be decisively negatived a must have looked like request for protection must so affect honour of regiment there be satisfaction one victim must be slain for aggressor in fatal duel be sure to be punished by removal into corp stationed at distance rupert be silent during discussion silently determined that must if opportunity offered take up gauntlet for argued that be primary cause of feud remembering word of monsieur dessin maitre dalboy thought that skillful swordsman a muller might be must yet have at least fair chance of victory while knew that so much must not be said for of other officer of regiment opportunity occurred two day later rupert with friend dillon went down to large saloon be usual rendezvous with friend fairholm loveday place be crowded with officer rupert soon perceived friend sitting at small table dillon placed two chair there also be engaged in conversation when sudden lull in buzz of talk caused to look up captain muller have just entered saloon with friend lull be caused by curiosity a boast have be matter of public talk a noticed that two officer of th be present be anticipated that scene must ensue glance at dillon face showed that blood have left cheek for brave a irishman be prospect of being killed like dog by native swordsman must not be terrible to did not doubt for moment that must be selected captain muller walked leisurely up to bar drank off bumper of raw geneva then turned looked round room a eye fell on uniform of th look of satisfaction came over face fixing eye on dillon walked leisurely across room rupert happened to be sitting on outside of table at once rose a calmly advanced towards german there be now dead silence in room listened intently to hear what lad have to say to duellist rupert spoke first although did not raise voice in slightest not sound be lost from one end of room to other captain muller said hear that have made boast that will kill first officer of regiment whom met be think first have now opportunity of proving whether be mere cutthroat liar perfect gasp of astonishment be heard in room dillon leapt to foot exclaiming rupert will not allow be senior officer gallant fellow must have pushed forward have not lord fairholm put hand on shoulder forced back saying leave alone know what be doing german took step back with hoarse exclamation of rage surprise at rupert address put hand to sword then making great effort to master fury said be safe in crowing loud little cockerel captain muller doe not fight with boy murmur of approval ran round room for prospect of lad standing up to be killed by so noted swordsman be painful alike to german english officer present same spirit appears to animate friend sir richard fulke rupert said quietly did not care about fighting boy so employed dozen of soldier to murder be lie captain thundered beware young sir how tempt too far know be not lie rupert said calmly know told be afraid to fight for be more than match seems to sir that seeming pity for youth be mere cover of fact that must rather choose a victim someone le skilled in fence than happen to be be coward too sir a well a ruffian enough german gasped swartzberg said turning to friend make arrangement for vow will kill insolent puppy in morning lord fairholm at once stepped forward to hessian captain will have honour to act a mr holliday second here be card will be at home evening rupert now resumed seat while captain muller friend moved to other end of saloon here be surrounded by number of german officer who endeavoured to dissuade from fighting duel in killing of adversary must be condemned by whole army a child murder child not said ferociously dy tomorrow think be mad to insult be conceit not madness head be turned fencing master once praised skill at fence think match for best swordsman though say in german army must not have forced quarrel on for be beneath notice be right glad that have taken up glove meant to throw down to fellow in killing will not only have punished only person who have for many year ventured to insult otto muller will have done service to friend sooner have rupert regained seat than dillon exclaimed rupert will never forgive others think be mad know that sacrifice to save did ill service lord said turning to lord fairholm by holding back when must have taken proper place will never hold up head again will not be for long for when have killed rupert will seek wherever may go force to kill too dear dillon knew what be doing lord fairholm said be clear that have to meet german cutthroat dillon asked in astonishment why must rather that friend rupert must be killed than be not putting case fairly lord fairholm said did stand so must certainly prefer that must run risk than rupert must do so case stand thus in first place be really quarrel in second while be certain that german must kill without fail be by mean certain that will kill rupert dillon eye opened with astonishment not kill do think that will spare after way have be insulted before of there be little chance of that be power not will that doubt feel certain far from regard issue a doubtful yet feel strong confidence in result for must know master dillon that rupert holliday boy a be be probably best swordsman in british army rupert holliday ejaculated dillon incredulously lord fairholm nodded be a say dillon although say german be also best in people be in way famous that way have be with best swordsman in french army that rupert have to fight mind must be le at ease come now have finished liquor may a well be off be centre of eye here be not pleasant to be general object of pity even when pity be ill bestowed besides have promised to be at home to wait for muller second will come round to quarter rupert when have arranged time place calm assured manner of rupert two friend did more to convince dillon that be speaking in earnest that really have confidence in rupert skill than asseveration on part must have done be still astounded at news that boy friend of who have never even mentioned that must fence must by possibility be not only first rate swordsman actually fair match for noted duellist upon way up to barrack rupert persuaded friend to say nothing a to skill be found impossible to remain silent for when officer heard of approaching duel there be universal cry of indignation colonel at once avowed intention of riding off to lord athlone to request to put stop to duel must be nothing short of murder honour of regiment will not suffer said sternly for will meet german cutthroat seeing that colonel be resolute rupert made sign to dillon that might speak accordingly related to astonished comrade substance of what lord fairholm have told rupert brother officer must not believe news rupert suggested that matter must be easily settled if foil be brought adding that hour fencing must be useful to get hand into work again proposal be agreed to first one then of recognized a best swordsman of regiment took place against without exerting in slightest proved so infinitely superior that doubt speedily changed into admiration meeting of morrow be soon regarded with feeling of not only hope confidence be late before lord fairholm rode up to cornet did think be never coming asked a entered rupert quarter affair have created quite excitement just a be starting two hour back message came to to go to headquarters found lordship in great passion rated soundly can tell for undertaking to be second in such disgracefully uneven contest a when have have say of course explained matter pointed out that german bully be nuisance to whole army that being a myself must vouch sort of phenomenon with sword have taken matter up to save brother officer from being killed assured have highest authority for being one of best swordsman in europe that therefore doubted not that be match for german also pointed out respectfully to that if be to interfere to stop a have intended matter must be certain to lead to many more meeting between officer of two nationality upon general after talk decided to allow matter to go on said that whichever way went must write to general commanding division of allied army must publish general order to effect henceforth duel will be permitted except after dispute being referred to court of honour of five senior officer by whom necessity otherwise of duel will be determined that in case of duel fought without such preliminary combatant will be dismissed service whether wound given be serious not think proposal be excellent one likely to do much good for in mixed army like ours cause for dispute jealousy be sure to arise without stringent regulation must be always fighting among ourselves at early hour on following morning stranger must have supposed that great military spectacle be about to take place so large be number of officer riding from liege military station around towards place fixed upon for duel event have created very unusual amount of excitement because in first place attempt to murder rupert at mill of dettinheim have created much talk intention of captain muller to force quarrel on officer of th have also be matter of public comment while manner in young cornet of regiment have taken up gage added to extraordinary inequality between combatant gave special character to duel be eight in morning when rupert holliday rode up to place fixed upon quiet valley three mile from town on slope of hill on side be gathered two three hundred officer english dutch german bottom of valley be forty yard across being left clear there be however none of life animation generally characterize military gathering british officer looked sombre stern at what deemed nothing short of approaching murder of gallant young countryman german be grave downcast for felt ashamed of inequality of contest among party there be earnest though quiet talk of arresting duel step must have be absolutely unprecedented arrival of officer of th who rode up in body few minute before rupert arrived with lord fairholm friend dillon somewhat changed aspect of affair for cheerful face showed that from cause at rest be unable to guess by mean regarded death of comrade a foregone event a alighted gave horse to orderly who have followed acquaintance gathered round full of expression of indignation regret at approaching duel be there chance of horrible business being stopped old colonel asked colonel forbes a alighted there be report that general have got wind of will at last moment put end to by arresting of fancy that matter will go on colonel forbes said be murder colonel chamber said indignantly not so much murder a think chamber for tell lad be simply marvel with sword ah colonel said have not heard that in case must lad like have chance with muller man who have not only reputation of being best swordsman in germany who now have be in something like thirty duel have more than twenty time killed man know ruffian skill address colonel forbes said yet tell that regard young friend chance a by mean desperate similar assurance have effect in raising spirit of english officer still refused to believe that lad like recently joined cornet must have real chance with noted duellist hope faded away altogether when rupert rode up be of course stranger to most of present smooth boyish face slight figure struck with pity dismay rupert however although little pale seemed more cheerful than anyone on ground smiled talked to lord fairholm dillon a if awaiting commencement of ordinary military parade be gallant young fellow be universal exclamation of most of present nationality face death a calmly a if be ignorant of danger five minute later captain muller rode up with second preparation for conflict at once began except combatant second retired to slope fairholm captain swartzberg stood in middle of bottom rupert stood back at short distance talking quietly with dillon colonel while captain muller walked about near foot of slope loudly saluting present with whom be acquainted there be little loss of time in choosing ground for bottom of valley be flat smooth sun be concealed beneath grey bank of cloud covered greater part of sky so that there be advantage of light when be arranged length of sword be measured have come provided with pair of duelling rapier a four weapon be of excellent temper of exactly even length difficulty be met with here then deep hush fell upon gathering a second returned to principal have be arranged by second that must not fight in uniform a heavy boot impeded action be accordingly attired in evening dress rupert wore dark puce satin breech white stocking very light buckled shoe opponent be in bright orange coloured breech with stocking to match coat waistcoat be soon removed shirt sleeve rolled up above elbow a took stand face to face something like groan went through spectator rupert stood about five foot nine slight active with smooth face head covered with short curl german stood six foot high with massive shoulder arm covered with muscle huge moustache be twisted upwards towards ear hair be cropped short stood erect over head be only among few of shrewder onlooker that full value of tough whipcordy look of rupert frame extreme activity promised by easy pose be appreciated general opinion went back to former verdict that disparity be so great that even putting aside german well known skill duel be little short of murder just before stood on guard captain muller said in loud voice now sir if have prayer to say say for warn will kill like dog cry of shame arose from entire body of spectator when abated rupert said quietly clearly prayer be said captain muller if yours be not say now for assuredly will kill not a dog for dog be true faithful animal a must kill tiger other beast whose existence be scourge to mankind cheer of approbation arose from circle with groan of rage captain muller took stand rupert faced in instant sword crossed for short time play be exceedingly cautious on side trying to find out opponent strength hitherto german have thought little of what fulke have told that have heard of rupert skill calm confident manner of young englishman now impressed with idea that really boy a be must be something out of common way thought in way abated own assurance merely taught that must be wiser to play cautiously at first instead of a have intended making fierce rapid attack at once finishing struggle almost a soon a began lightning speed with first thrust be parried returned soon showed wisdom of course have adopted expression of arrogant disdain with have commenced fight speedily changed to one of care determination insolent boy be to be killed operation must not be carelessly carried out for time attempted by skillful play to get through rupert guard lad sword always met point flashed so quickly vengefully forward that several time be only by quick backward spring that escaped from intense silent excitement among spectator increased with thrust parry nerve seemed to tingle in unison with sharp clink of sword german now endeavoured to take advantage of superior height length of arm strength to force down rupert guard latter slipped away from bounding a lightly a cat out of range returning with such rapid elastic spring that german be in turn obliged to use utmost activity to get back out of reach so far several slight scratch have be given on side nothing in way to affect combatant a struggle continued gaining moment in earnestness effort look of anxiety gradually stole over german face perspiration stood thick on forehead knew now that have met match internal feeling told that although have exerted to utmost opponent have not yet put out full strength skill rupert face be unchanged since sword have crossed mouth be set in half smile eye be bright demeanour rather that of lad fencing with buttoned foil than of one contending for life against formidable foe now thoroughly aware of opponent strength tactic rupert began to press attack foot by foot drove opponent back to spot at combat have commenced then after fierce rally gave opening german lunged rupert threw back body with rapidity of lightning lunging also a did so opponent sword grazed cheek a passed while own ran through german body until hilt struck muller fell without word inert mass surgeon running up pronounced that life be already extinct crowd of spectator now flocked down english with difficulty repressing exclamation of delight congratulated rupert on result to appeared almost miraculous while senior german officer present came up to said although captain muller be countryman of mine sir rejoice in unexpected result of duel have rid army of man who be scourge to plaster bandage be now applied to rupert wound in few minute whole party have left valley one german orderly alone remaining to watch body of dead duellist until party must be sent out to convey to town for burial chapter battle of dyke for time after duel with captain muller be probable that little cornet be after marlborough most popular man in british army in flanders however bore honour quietly shrinking from notice seldom going down into town mention of duel be painful to for although considered that be perfectly justified in taking up quarrel forced upon regiment yet sincerely regretted that must have be obliged to kill man however dangerous obnoxious in cold blood two day after duel received letter from grandfather be only second have received in previous letter colonel holliday alluded to something have said in prior communication rupert have written back to say that such letter have come to hand answer ran a follows dear grandson letter have duly come to hand regret to find that first to miscarried by comparing date think that must have be lost in wreck of brig flora be lost in tempest on way to holland few day after wrote being so be ignorant of change have taken place here affect in slight degree match between lady mother sir william brownlow be broken off took place just after sailed for war be brought about by friend monsieur dessin gentleman who be although know not name french nobleman of title distinction received about time left news that might shortly expect to hear that decree have sent into exile be reversed little time later compatriot of came down to stay with monsieur dessin who know cherished ill feeling against sir william for insult son have passed upon daughter for various belittling word respecting that young lady sir william have in anger permitted to use in public took occasion when be riding through street of derby accompanied by friend lord pomeroy sir john hawkes gentleman of fashion repute to accost sir william swore at a french dancing master whereupon monsieur dessin at once challenged to duel sir william refused with many scornful word to meet man of such kind whereupon monsieur dessin drawing lord pomeroy to in confidence disclosed name quality to compatriot also french nobleman testified of offered to produce document proof did then adjourn to tavern where called for private room to talk matter over out of earshot of crowd after examining proof lord pomeroy sir john hawkes declared that sir william brownlow must not refuse satisfaction monsieur dessin demanded have always be suspected that sir william be man of small courage though of overbearing manner be mightily put to when heard that must fight with man whom justly regarded a being far more than match so craven did become indeed that gentleman with did not scruple to express disgust loudly monsieur dessin said that unless sir william did afford satisfaction must trounce publicly a coward that have one other alternative to offer be mightily surprised when stated that alternative be that must write letter to mistress holliday renouncing claim to hand sir william for time refused to do blustering much finally having stomach for fight fearing indignity of public whipping did consent so to do monsieur dessin having called for paper pen letter be then written four gentleman signed a witness party then separated lord pomeroy sir john hawkes riding off without exchanging word with sir william brownlow lady mother be in great taking when received letter learned manner in have come to be written monsieur dessin left town with daughter two day later came over to take farewell of expressed with great feeling heartiness a to kindness be good enough to say that have shown assured a may believe that action have forced mistress holliday suitor to take left infinitely debtor promised to write to from france whither be about to return said that regretted much that vow have sworn to keep name unknown in england save except honour must compel to disclose prevented from telling that must in future let know after be known that have left sir william brownlow again attempted to make advance to lady mother who lack not spirit repulsed so scornfully that fear of future entanglement in quarter be at end at have rejoiced mightily although chace now that have gone be greatly changed to farmer parson sends duty to love to hugh think that must not be ill taken if in short time be to write to mistress holliday make mention of broken espousal be subject upon care not to touch earl of marlborough have be good enough to write letter speaking in high term of handed to to read although said word when handed back must see that be much moved pen run not so fast a did will therefore now conclude loving grandfather letter gave great pleasure to rupert not because restored to succession of estate of chace for of that thought little because mother be saved from match must felt sure have be unhappy one for winter passed off quietly with spring two army again took field campaign of be like predecessor marred by pusillanimity indecision of dutch deputy who thwarted marlborough scheme for bringing french to general engagement so ruined english general

army must have be passed at will to either one side other of alp must have thrown with overwhelming force upon austria upon prince eugene who commanded imperial troop in italy mountaineer of tyrol however flew to arm held pass with such extreme bravery that bavarian on north french on south must make progress design have for time be abandoned austria be paralyzed by formidable insurrection of hungary appeared certain that vienna must in ensuing campaign fall into hand of french during winter marlborough laboured earnestly to prepare for important campaign must take place in spring after usual amount of difficulty arising from private political enemy at home in holland succeeded in carrying out plan in arranging that dutch must hold frontier line alone that must carry rest of army into position there seemed well nigh desperate marshal tallard with men be posted on upper rhine in readiness to advance through black forest join advanced force bavarian who also numbered men united army be to advance upon vienna so weakened be empire be defended only by army of men placed on frontier on th of may marlborough set out with army crossed meuse at maestricht arrived at bonn on th of month marching up rhine crossed at coblentz on th pushed on to mundlesheim where met prince eugene who now commanded allied force there next only to marlborough be greatest general of age skillful dashing yet prudent brave to fault for general can be too brave frank sincere incapable of petty jealousy between marlborough from date of first meeting most cordial friendship most loyal cooperation prevailed be always anxious to give other credit thought more of other glory than own so rapidly have marlborough marched that only cavalry have come up prince eugene reviewing remarked that be finest body of men have ever seen few day later prince of baden came down from austrian army of danube to meet eugene marlborough wished prince to take command of army of rhine leaving army of danube to joint command prince however stood upon rank be finally arranged that eugene must command army of rhine that marlborough prince of baden must command army of danube on alternate day arrangement so objectionable that be surprising did not terminate in disaster marlborough at once marched with force making way with great difficulty through long narrow defile of gieslingen effected junction with prince of baden army found on nd of july at head of army of battalion squadron of horse gun confronting french bavarian army consisting of battalion squadron gun mortar in strong position on danube bulk of army be on right bank on left bank be height of schellenberg covering passage of river at donauwoerth held by men including horse along front of hill be old rampart french be engaged in strengthening when allied army arrived latter be not when came up according to ordinary military idea in condition to attack camp have be broken up at three in morning be two in afternoon before arrived after long fatiguing march in front of enemy position thinking that be probable that must be forced to fight immediately upon arriving marlborough have selected picked men from battalion amounting to men together with thirty squadron of horse a advance guard close behind followed three regiment of imperial grenadier under prince louis total strength of force be men french bavarian general did not expect attack knowing distance that troop have marched therefore quietly continued work of strengthening entrenchment duke of marlborough seeing work upon be engaged determined to attack at once for a said to prince of baden who wished to allow men night rest hour delay will cost thousand men order be therefore given for instant assault upon hill of schellenberg not only be position very strong in in front of be wood so thick that attack must be made through be necessary therefore to attack by flank of position one of flank be covered by fire of fortress of donauwoerth be a bad a siege rupert said discontentedly to friend dillon for squadron formed part of advance be always out of be in great hurry to get bright cuirass of yours dented rupert agree with cavalry be always out of there go infantry in splendid order picked men moved forward against face of enemy position extending from wood to covered way of fortress when arrived within range of grape be swept by so fearful storm of shot that line wavered general goor bravest officer be struck down line fell into confusion bavarian seeing leapt from entrenchment pursued broken assailant with bayonet when disordered by rush battalion of english guard have kept ground poured so tremendous fire into flank that fell back to entrenchment look serious dillon said a ally fell back enemy be two to one have got advantage of position there be duke rupert exclaimed reforming there go again be leading what terrible fire look how officer of staff be dropping oh if duke must be hit see infantry be slackening advance in spite of shout of officer be wavering oh how dreadful here come back again duke be going to try again rupert see how be waving hand exhorting men to fresh attack be right lad be right have formed again there go again troop wavered broke under terrible rain of bullet time bavarian in great force leapt from entrenchment pounced down upon broken line prepare to charge shouted general lumley who commanded cavalry forward trot gallop charge with cheer cavalry chafed at long inaction while comrade be suffering so terribly dashed forward threw furiously upon bavarian driving headlong back to line then falling back under tremendous fire rolled over men horse in number at moment cheer broke from dispirited infantry a head of three regiment of imperial grenadier led by prince of baden arrived on ground without halting moved forward towards extreme left of enemy position have be left to extent unguarded many of troop having be called off to repulse marlborough attack pushed back two battalion of french infantry entered work general d'arco french commanding officer withdrew of men from centre to hold prince of baden in check marlborough profited by confusion so caused to endeavour for fourth time to carry hill force be however now fearfully weakened general lumley after conferring with for moment rode back to cavalry th dragoon will dismount join infantry said in moment soldier be on foot five minute later regiment marching side by side with infantry advanced up hill time assault be successful enemy confused by fact that ally have already forced line on left wavered fire be wild ineffectual with tremendous cheer ally scaled height burst into work close behind general lumley led cavalry who made way through gap in entrenchment fell upon fugitive with dreadful slaughter french bavarian fled to bridge across danube below donauwoerth choked by weight gave way great number be drowned rest retreated through donauwoerth rear being gallantly covered by general d'arco with small body of troop who held together sixteen gun thirteen standard fell into victor hand loss of ally considering force that brought into field for main army have not arrived when victory be decided be extraordinary for out of total of men including cavalry lost killed wounded more than force greater part of be english for upon fell whole brunt of fighting enemy suffered comparatively little in battle great number be killed in pursuit drowned in danube still greater number of bavarian scattered to home out of men only joined army on other side of danube elector of bavaria fell back with army to augsburg under cannon of fortress encamped in position too strong to be attacked strong place fell into hand of ally effort be made to induce to break off from alliance with france elector however relying upon aid of marshal tallard who be advancing with men to assistance refused to listen to term allied power ordered marlborough to harry country so force into submission by misery of subject such order be most repugnant to duke who be one of most humane of men who by uniform kind treatment of prisoner not only did much to mitigate horror of war in be engaged set example have since time be followed by civilized army have however no resource to obey order cavalry of ally be sent to carry fire through bavaria no le than town village be destroyed in barbarous warfare duty be abhorrent to rupert who waited on duke begged a greatest of favour to attach for short time to staff in order that might not be obliged to accompany regiment duke who have already offered rupert appointment on staff offer have gratefully declined a preferred to do duty with regiment at once acceded to request be thus spared horror of seeing agony of unhappy peasantry

collecting a many of troop a must marched with speed in same direction a prince eugene who with army have marched in parallel line with french now ran risk of being crushed by united force by dint of great exertion marlborough joined prince with cavalry on tenth of august infantry came up next day two great army now faced other numerical force being not unequal french being about strong ally in other respect however advantage lay wholly with enemy have ninety gun while ally have fifty one while out of troop under marshal tallard be best troop france must produce allied army be motley assembly composed of nearly equal number of english prussian dane wurtemburghers dutch hanoverian hessian although not more numerous than troop of other nationality be felt by that brunt of battle must fall upon british have throughout three campaign shown fighting quality of so high character that whole army have come to look upon a mainstay in battle heavy loss have taken place among flower of troop at assault of schlessingen greatly decreased fighting power of marlborough army weakness caused by miscellaneous character of army be so much felt that marlborough be urged to draw off not to tempt fortune under such unfavourable circumstance marshal villeroi be however within few day march with large force marlborough felt that if effected junction with tallard austria be lost be therefore necessary at hazard to fight at once french position be exceedingly strong one right rested on danube village of blenheim close to bank be held by twenty six battalion twelve squadron native french troop left be equally protected from attack by range of hill impregnable for gun cavalry in centre of line between flank be village of oberglau in around lay thirty battalion of infantry among whom be fine irish regiment from blenheim to oberglau thence on to lutzingen at foot of hill french line occupied somewhat rising ground in front of be rivulet of nebel running through low swampy

defeat infantry being posted very strongly in three village be very carefully entrenched barricaded insufficient attention be paid to long line of communication between be principally held by numerous cavalry be weak point for be clear that if ally must get across rivulet swamp break through cavalry line infantry must be separated unable to reunite strong force in blenheim must run risk of being surrounded without possibility of retreat a danube be unfordable upon side of ally troop be divided into two distinct army under prince eugene consisting of eighteen battalion of infantry seventy four

artillery became more violent french horse strong stood ground at first firmly choicest bravest of chivalry be there banderolls of almost noble of france floated over squadron so hot be fire of musketry cannon when assailant drew near advance be checked retired sixty pace battle be kept up for few minute only by fire of artillery gradually however fire of artillery slackened marlborough taking advantage of pause led cavalry again to charge with irresistible vehemence line dashed forward at full speed soon crest of ridge be passed french horseman discharged carbine at considerable distance with little effect immediately wheeled about fled battle be gained allied horse rapidly inundated open space between two village six battalion in middle be surrounded cut to piece taken made noble resistance men be found lying on back in rank a have stood in field thus at one blow whole french line of defence be broken up blenheim be entirely cut off rear of left beyond oberglau

boat to be manned by strong party of rower with well armed men one have better go up river one down for know not in direction will take flight what think master holliday think that boat have better go way without moment loss of time rupert said doubt whether will find send boat without moment delay with order to overhaul search craft overtake magistrate at once called in officer of guard gave necessary instruction why do not think that up down river will overtake van duyk asked rupert a officer left room because will know that fleet horseman will pas that by morning people at town on bank will be on lookout for so having sent off boat must now send off horseman up down river with letter from sir to authority at town begging to stop search boat again necessary order be given be right to take step rupert said for may be greater fool than take to be think that have done one of two thing have gone up down river to place probably not far away where horse be in readiness may be still in town still in town yes rupert said will know that must pursue up down river that must scour country round may think that must not suspect that be still here there must be lot of secure hiding place in old town like may well think safer to keep hidden here until force into marriage wring fabulous ransom from will search house burgomaster said from cellar to roof must be useless rupert said there must be secret hiding place where must be stowed away bound gagged perhaps must never detect must lose moment of time in sending out horseman to village on side of river above below for circle of twenty mile if horseman have passed through villager other be sure to have be awoke by clatter of horse if get news must follow up trace wherever go if not will be strong proof that be still here in case pursuit over country will lead to think that have suspicion that be here will have far more chance of lighting upon clue than if thought suspected get trusty men to work at once question prisoner men have taken with sharp pain will wring truth from let be done quietly while on other hand let chase through country be a active public a possible threat application of string twisted round thumb tightened until blood spurted from beneath nail rough mode of questioning have not yet died out soon elicited from captive place where arch conspirator have be staying while laid train for explosion a

merchant for awhile to thought rupert retired to room telling hugh joe to follow explained to exactly step have be taken opinion a to true state of thing bade think matter over in light to come to at daybreak let know if plan for conduct of search have occurred to result of night thought of morning deliberation be conveyed to mynheer van duyk by rupert first thing to be done be to offer large reward sir for news may lead to discovery of daughter may may not bring in information next thing be to have eye kept on boat by quay may have cabin half deck capable of concealing person wrapped up

until hotness of search be over can pas up down river without being stopped overhauled will have boat at quay searched at once boat party will be sent off to examine craft at anchor moored in river think sir that behoves to act with care rupert said for knowing desperate nature of villain think probable that must wreak hate upon daughter do terrible crime when found that be discovered for know that life be already forfeit when find out where be confined to mind serious difficulty only commences for be absolutely necessary that arrest be so prompt sudden that will not have time even to level pistol at van duyk acknowledged justice of rupert reasoning hugh have suggested that be likely that have in pay same boatman whom employed last year to murder a first step let one of clerk go down

well content that have seen world have something to look back upon beyond six mile circuit of derby next campaign may be passed over briefly parsimony of england holland indifference of germany spoiled plan of marlborough lost ally benefit of victory of blenheim french in spite of heavy loss took field in far greater force than ally instead of brilliant offensive campaign have planned marlborough have to stand on defensive gallantry of english troop effect blenheim have produced upon morale of french enabled to hold ground won to obtain several minor success one notably at dyle where villeroi troop be driven out of line considered impregnable where pusillanimity ill will of dutch general prevented substantial result being obtained important action took place end of found thing in nearly same state have left non success of campaign undid of harm success of of have effected in flanders genius of duke have enabled ally to maintain ground on rhine have done badly in italy french have carried before therefore while after blenheim apathy have fallen on victor so now extent of danger moved to fresh exertion marlborough after seeing army into winter quarter visited capital of vienna berlin hague again by charm of manner succeeded in pacifying jealousy in healing quarrel in obtaining promise of vigorous action larger armament in spring bad conduct of dutch general have created general cry of indignation through europe that state general be compelled by pressure of public opinion to dismiss several of men who have most distinguished by thwarting plan of marlborough interposing on occasion between victory consequently campaign of seemed likely to open with far brighter prospect of success than predecessor have done suddenly however arrangement broke down imperialist have just suffered reverse in italy matter looked so desperate there that marlborough proposed to pas alp with army of men to assistance there a must have warm cooperation of prince eugene instead of cowardice of dutch general incapacity obstinacy of prince of baden anticipated complete discomfiture of french in hope however be thwarted prince of baden must hing beyond defending own dominion cabinet of berlin copenhagen fell to quarrelling refused to supply promised contingent hanoverian hessian have also grievance refused to join in general plan to send troop to form part of allied army thus idea of campaign in south be destroyed marlborough persuaded dutch to send of troop in pay across alp to assist prince eugene under promise that with english dutch troop must defend flanders so campaign commenced on th of may marlborough joined army lay encamped on dyle on french frontier on nd danish contingent have at last moment be dispatched in answer to urgent appeal of duke arrived army now consisted of battalion squadron in men with gun marshal villeroi force lay on other side of dyle consisted of battalion squadron men with gun have also a at blenheim advantage that troop be of one nationality accustomed to act together while marlborough army consisted of troop of three nation at least half of new to war unused to act with other marlborough opened campaign by moving towards tirlemont with view of laying siege to namur where many of citizen be anxious to throw off french yoke villeroi anxious to cover namur moved troop out from quarter on dyle to stop advance of ally bring on battle in open field ground taken up by french marshal be exceedingly strong marlborough be aware of great importance of position have made effort to be first to seize french

tomb barrow of ancient german hero ottomond highest part of ridge commanding whole field of battle marlborough having with dutch general overkirk loyal gallant old man reconnoitred ground immediately formed plan of attack french position be somewhat in form of bow end being advanced must therefore have more difficulty in sending troop from one end to other of line than must ally who must move in direct line along a be string of bow ground be sufficiently undulating to enable movement of troop to be concealed from enemy on plateau commanding position of ottomond tomb appeared key of whole battleground marlborough determined to make main attack on point first deceiving enemy by feigned attack on left accordingly formed in conspicuous position heavy column of attack opposite french left menacing village of autre eglise villeroi believing that main attack must be made there moved considerable body of infantry from centre behind offuz to reinforce autre eglise a column of attack advanced large portion be withdrawn by dip behind rising ground on others advanced moved rapidly towards left centre danish horse twenty squadron strong being directed to same spot smoke of advance towards autre eglise nature of ground concealed movement from french who directed very heavy artillery fire on column advancing against autre eglise suddenly real attack began five dutch battalion advanced against tavieres twelve battalion under general schultz supported by strong reserve moved to attack ramilies vehemence of attack showed villeroi that have be deceived have now no infantry available to move to reinforce troop in threatened village therefore ordered fourteen squadron of dragoon to dismount with two swiss battalion to advance to support of tavieres arrived however too late for before must reach spot dutch battalion have with great gallantry carried village duke of marlborough launching danish horse on support a came up cut up terribly threw back remnant in confusion upon french cavalry advancing to charge overkirk now charged french cavalry with first of allied horse broke drove back at moment when allied cavalry be in disorder after success second line of french cavalry among whom be royal life guard burst upon drove back in great confusion restored battle in quarter danger be great for victorious cavalry might have swept round fallen upon rear of infantry engaged in attack upon ramilies marlborough saw danger putting at head of seventeen squadron of dragoon sending aide de camp to order up twenty squadron still in reserve charged french life guard french battery on height behind ramilies poured in so dreadful fire that cavalry hesitated french trooper recognizing duke made dash at a rode ahead of troop in instant be surrounded before of troop must ride to rescue cut way through french trooper sword in hand a horse tried to leap wall fell enemy be again upon at moment rupert holliday whose troop be in front line arrived on spot followed by hugh dozen other trooper of duke personal staff desperate fight raged round general until cavalry charged heavily down to rescue of beloved leader be still over matched pressed backwards by french guard at critical time however twenty squadron of reserve arrived on ground charged french cavalry in front while danish cavalry who have be detained by morass fell at same moment on flank french cavalry fell back in confusion forming allied cavalry in two line marlborough led forward in person sweeping aside resistance halted not until reached summit of ottomond tomb where be visible to whole army while tremendous shout told friend foe alike that key of whole position have be gained victory in part of field secured time twenty french battalion in ramilies under marquis maffie have fought obstinately although far removed from succour gradually however be driven out of village british have fresh battalion of infantry available be sent against victorious horse charging in flank be almost made prisoner destroyed fight have lasted three hour victory be complete on right left confusion be however great marlborough halted troop reformed before advancing to final attack while marshal villeroi strove on part also to reform troop to take up new front road be however choked with baggage waggon artillery before troop must take up fresh post ally be ready charge be sounded horse foot advanced to attack on centre while troop who have commenced battle by demonstration against autre eglise joined in general attack confused disheartened french did not await onslaught broke

of de pignerolles have never ceased to interest in favour king too be in need of experienced soldier for war be about to break out lastly by tone in friend spoke rupert saw that subject be rather sore one majesty wished to have adele near court mademoiselle dessin rupert said in astonishment well not exactly mademoiselle dessin marquis said smiling la marquise adele de pignerolles who be by mother side be montmorency one of richest heiress in france a inheriting land royal ward although father be alive even so rupert said what can majesty wish to have at court for because a very rich heiress a very pretty one hand be valuable prize majesty may well intend a reward to courtier of high merit oh monsieur dessin rupert said earnestly surely mean that be sorry to say that do master rupert grand monarque be not in habit of considering such trifle a heart inclination in bestowal of royal ward although be sort of treason to say so must rather be back in england have adele to myself be able to give to worthy man whom might love than to see hand held out a prize of courtier of versailles have lived long enough in england to have got of english notion that woman ought at least to have right of refusal rupert said nothing felt sorry full of pity at thought of young girl remembered so well being bestowed a sort of royal gift upon courtier quite irrespective of dictate of own heart after sitting time in silence marquis changed subject suddenly be afraid will not be exchanged before next winter rupert there be doubt plenty of prisoner in marlborough hand campaign be sure to be stirring rapid one after defeat will strike heavy blow will be doing best to avoid will not be until fighting be over that negotiation for exchange of prisoner will begin next morning marquis de pignerolles

incident direct from villeroi leave at noon rupert will accompany unless indeed must prefer remaining here on chance of getting earlier exchange rupert naturally declared at once for journey to paris officer on parole be in day treated with great courtesy especially if happened to have powerful friend therefore looked forward to pleasant stay in paris to renewal of acquaintance with adele to sight of glory of versailles under louis xiv be gayest most intellectual most distinguished court of europe louis xiv must not be termed good man be unquestionably great king did much for france whose greatness power strove to increase yet be in slight degree owing to policy that seventy year later tempest be to burst out in france be to sweep away nobility crown be to deluge soil of france with best blood to carry war through europe to end at last by prostration of france beneath foot of nation to whom have be scourge tremendous effort made by louis xiv to maintain spanish succession have secured for france draining of land of men impoverishing of noble who hesitated at sacrifice effort to enable country to make head against foe exhausted land while immense extravagance of splendid court in midst of impoverished land ruined not only by war by destruction of trade by exile of best most industrious of people on account of religion caused deep widespread discontent throughout town country of france three hour later rupert set out with marquis of pignerolles two trooper after two day ride through belgium reached valenciennes where uniform of rupert in scarlet bright cuirass of british dragoon excited much attention for british prisoner be rare in france on evening of fifth day reached paris where rode to mansion of marquis rupert be aware that must not see adele who be

however a will have coat for model tailor will soon fashion suit must pas muster a uniform before marlborough saw adele told have brought english officer who have galloped in darkness into rank a prisoner did not mention name will be amusing to see if recognizes be quite indignant at taking prisoner said that thought soldier ought not to take advantage of accident of kind in fact although adele a tell be very french at heart five year passed in derby have left deep impression upon be very happy at school one a say be kind to result be that although rejoices over victory in italy germany talk very little about flanders campaign about by way be even a french a possible there must not be anything very pleasant to say rupert be at once furnished from wardrobe of marquis with clothes of kind a be about same height although rupert be somewhat broader heavier thing fitted well rupert be able to go about paris without being object of observation curiosity by people rupert be somewhat disappointed in paris street be narrower than of london although public building be fine louvre especially being infinitely grander than palace of saint james there be not anything like bustle rush of business have struck rupert so much on arrival in london upon arriving at versailles however rupert be struck with wonder nothing that have seen must compare with stately glory of versailles be then real capital of france wing of magnificent palace be set apart for reception of noble military men whose business brought for short period to court here apartment have be assigned to marquis clothes have already be sent down by mounted lackey rupert be soon in full uniform again cuirass alone being laid aside laced scarlet coat other item of attire be strictly in accordance with somewhat lax regulation a to dress of officer of dragoon lace cravat falling in front dress lace ruffle of wrist be certainly more ample than duke of marlborough might have considered fit for

standing a did six foot high with broad shoulder merry good tempered face with brown curl falling on lace collar young lieutenant be a fine looking specimen of well grown englishman a must be desired

six year of age be still handsome eye be bright movement quick vivacious courtier bent low a king moved slowly down line addressing word here there king eye quickly caught that of young englishman who with companion be taller than majority of present louis moved forward until stopped before so sir englishman said be one of who have be maltreating soldier methinks have more reason than have to complain of fortune of war trust that in case misfortune will be light one that stay in court capital will not be unpleasant one have reason sire to complain of fortune of war rupert said since to owe honour of seeing gracious majesty most brilliant court in world spoken like courtier king said with slight smile pray consider invited to fete at court to entree reception hope that will do best to

de pignerolles sauntered across room to young lady who be sitting with three others surrounded by group of gentleman rupert be watching saw stoop over girl for be little more say few word in ear

de carolan who clearly resented warm tone in spoke said quite hero of romance mademoiselle unfortunate who incurred paladin indignation be clearly more insolent than skillful sir amadis of sixteen must hardly have prevailed against dragon time adele de pignerolles be seriously angry monsieur le duc de carolan said quietly have honoured by professing admiration of poor person methinks good taste must have demanded that must have feigned at least interest in boy who championed cause be wrong even in merry jest to touch on subject thought that a french gentleman must understand be serious half jesting at for girlish love of mine be not here to defend against uncourteous remark monsieur le duc allow to inform that fact that person who insulted paid for almost with life be proof of great want of skill for monsieur father will inform if care to ask have stood opposite to boy hero result must probably have be exactly same for a have often heard say that boy be fully match for imagine that chance of nobleman who with merit have not so far a have heard great pretension to special skill with sword must be slight indeed duke with air of bitter mortification on face bowed before indignant

be perfectly true that a child have be hero young girl hero seldom withstand ordeal of four year absence adele be exception rupert have gone out of existence have not thought of beyond occasional feeling of wonder whether be alive for year have not be for unlucky speech indeed must not have made have of girlish feeling remained must have met a frankly cordially a in day when danced together in spite therefore of effort be with heightened colour that a demanded by etiquette adele rose making deep reverence in return to even deeper bow of rupert extended hand taking tip of finger rupert bent over kissed then looking up in face said marquis father have encouraged to hope that will take pity upon poor prisoner forget forgive having fought against compatriot adele adroitly took up line thus offered to be soon deep in laughing contest with a to merit of respective country above a to opinion of french beauty rupert answered in exaggerated compliment characteristic of time after talking

flushed hotly father madame de soissons be talking together in deep bay window at end of room so heard last night monsieur rupert well there be nothing to be ashamed of be hero when be child mind saying so now if have made heroine must have be different never did one bit now try to tell story must find out in moment be accustomed to hear falsehood day there be nothing to be ashamed of mademoiselle one must have hero be only boy knew one must have misunderstood even to artificial fop who be standing round there seemed nothing strange unmaidenly in avowal that when be little girl made hero of boy be quite right did not make heroine of boy think always make heroine of woman much older than looked upon a dear bright little girl whom must have cared for protected a must favourite dog boy be given to heroine worship think that be line be only just getting out of boyhood now have never have heroine at so sat chatted easily pleasantly a if four year have be rolled back be boy

up in bastille at loch other of fortress dungeon adele might be ordered to give hand at once to man selected for there be hope in time adele may in time really come to love one of suitor if be one of

among lady rupert be general favourite puzzled altogether be ready to chat to pay compliment to act a chevalier to lady compliment never passed beyond boundary of mere courtly expression in court where appeared to be almost duty of everyone to be in love rupert holliday did not seem to know what love meant oddness of dashing looking young officer who be marquis de pignerolles assured everyone very gallant soldier who have killed in duel finest swordsman in german army being perfectly proof to blandishment ready to treat woman with equal courtesy attention be mystery to lady of court of versailles rupert be regarded a most novel amusing specimen of english coldness impenetrability rupert be absolutely ignorant of opinion with men woman alike regarded dreamt not that be only character so high authority a marquis de pignerolles have given a swordsman of extraordinary skill prevented duc de carolan of adele other admirer from forcing quarrel upon still le did imagine that lady of court considered in highest degree singular that did not fall in love with of went way laughed talked be pleasant with everyone enjoyed life especially morning visit to madame de soissons first

although marquis must a heretofore be received at court yet rupert be not to leave circuit of wall of paris marquis who have foreseen gathering storm in hundred petty symptom be not surprised at order knew jealousy with king regarded person who appeared even remotely likely to interfere with plan that have formed be sure that mere hint from favourite a to possibility of rupert intimacy at madame de soissons proving obstacle to carrying out of wish with regard to disposal of adele hand must be sufficient to ensure issue of order for instant dismissal from versailles rupert be astonished indignant at order at rate may call say 'goodbye to mademoiselle may not think that have better not rupert have simply order to leave versailles at one o'clock today can therefore only ask to be here at hour be now eleven very well sir rupert said will be here in time a be not prisoner can go about where like think that even king must object to paying visit of adieu on presenting at madame de soissons rupert

sitting a judge before have nothing to say rupert said quietly escaped from lille because have be a deemed unworthily treated in paris have withdrawn parole be therefore free to escape if must did escape finding frontier swarmed with french troop thought safer to make for central france where wayfarer must not be looked upon a suspiciously a in north here be decline to answer further question a to lady of whom question rejoice to find by drift of question that have withdrawn from persecution suffered have escaped being forced into marriage with man once described in hearing a ape in costume of day be will say prisoner governor asked while duc de carolan gave exclamation of fury be sir must urge that a english officer be entitled to fair honourable treatment for although might have be shot in act of trying to escape from prison be rule that escaping prisoner caught afterwards a be must have fair treatment although imprisonment must be stricter more secure than before a to other matter there can not be be assured even tittle of evidence to connect with event mention a far a hear from escaped on th from lille date be indeed accurate three day later mademoiselle de pignerolles left versailles connection between two event doe not appear in way clear to may may not be governor said however duty be clear to keep here in safe ward until receive majesty order four day later royal order came rupert be to be taken to dreaded fortress prison of loch place from not one in hundred of who entered in ever came from alive chapter loch british officer broke out from lille ah governor of loch said to a glanced over royal order something else beyond fancy prisoner of war who try to break prison be not sent to loch suppose have be in somebody way very seriously fine young fellow too really splendid fellow pity really however be not business number four in south tower said rupert be led away number four be cell on third story of south tower more than rupert did not know there be looking out from loophole admitted light for be boarded up on outside there be fireplace table chair bedstead twice day gaoler entered with provision made reply to rupert question shook head when spoken to for first week rupert bore imprisonment with cheerfulness absolute silence absence of anything to break dreary monotony probability that might remain prisoner life be crushing even to most active energetic temperament at end of month gaoler made motion for to follow ascending stair to great height reached platform on top of tower rupert be delighted with sight of sky of wide spreading field even though latter be covered with snow for half hour paced rapidly round round limited walk presently gaoler touched pointing below said look rupert looked over battlement saw little party issue from small postern gate far below cross broad fosse pause in open space formed by outlying work beyond bore with box funeral rupert asked man nodded go out at last said unless tell what be wanted to tell go other way five minute later rupert be again locked up in cell when be in afternoon of same day visited by governor who asked if must say where have taken mademoiselle pignerolles may a well answer said will never go out alive unless do rupert shook head admit that know aught concerning lady name did so must prefer death to betraying ay governor said might do death be very preferable to life at loch in day two rupert found again desponding will not do said earnestly must arouse let think what have heard that prisoner do in first place try to escape have escaped from place a difficult a loch well be one thing to be thought very seriously about in next place have heard of making pet of spider sort of thing well may come to at present like spider well enough to make pet of besides see spider to make pet of then prisoner have carved wall have taste for carving might keep muscle in order health good by exercise with chair table get to hold out at arm length lift table with one hand so on yes sort of exercise might be continued in way more take exercise better will sleep at night enjoy meal yes with nothing else to do might become almost samson here there now whole time be marked out escape from prison exercise will try last first then think over other for long time rupert worked away with furniture until have quite exhausted then feeling happier better than have done since be shut up began to think of plan of escape easiest way must of course be to knock down gag gaoler to escape in clothes plan put aside at once a be morally certain that must be nearer to escape after reaching courtyard of prison than be in cell there remained then chimney loophole solid wall chimney be first to disappear from calculation looking up rupert saw that be crossed by dozen iron bar height too be very great even when at top height be immense to descend to fosse loophole be next examined be far too narrow to squeeze through be crossed by three set of bar chance of widening narrow loophole removing bar without detection be extreme besides rupert have strong idea that loophole looked into courtyard finally came to conclusion that if escape be to be made must be by raising flag of floor tunnelling between room that underneath working out through solid wall must be tremendous work for loophole showed that wall must be ten foot thick still a said to will be at least something to do to think about even if take five year come to nothing will have be useful thus resolved rupert went to work laboured steadily exercise with chair table succeeded admirably after six month be able to perform feat of strength with surprised with scheme for escape be le fortunate tool be faulty stone have to work upon be too compact well built beyond getting up flag making hole below in hard cement filled in space between floor large enough to bury good sized cat rupert achieved nothing have gone into prison in november be now august be fast coming to idea that loch be not to be broken out of by way in be attempting to do one circumstance gave intense delight adele hiding place have not be discovered be sure of by urgency with governor strove to extract from secret of whereabouts demand be at last meeting mingled with threat rupert felt that governor have received stringent order to wring truth from so serious did menace become that rupert ceased to labour at floor of cell being assured that ere long change other must take place be not mistaken one day governor entered attended a usual by gaoler official sir said to rupert can no longer be trifled with have order to obtain from name of place to escorted young lady went off with if refuse to answer different system to have hitherto be pursued will be adopted will be removed from comfortable room placed in dungeon once there must either speak die for few men be robust enough to exist there for many week be sorry sir have duty to do will speak will change room will change room rupert said quietly may die if by chance must ever see light again be assured that europe will know how officer taken in war be treated by king of france governor shrugged shoulder made sign to gaoler who opened door a governor left four other warder entered room rupert smiled knew that display of force be occasioned by fact that gaoler entering room suddenly have several time caught balancing weighty table on arm performing other feat have astounded frenchman work at cell wall have always be done at night be ready to accompany rupert said without word followed conductor downstairs arrived at level with yard door be unlocked party descended down stair where cold dampness of air struck chill to rupert heart down forty foot then door be unlocked rupert saw new abode be of about same size a last be altogether without furniture in one corner a saw by light of lantern gaoler carried be stone bench on be bundle of wall streamed with moisture in place water stood in willow pool on floor dungeon be twelve foot high eight foot from ground be narrow loophole eighteen inch in height about three inch wide gaoler placed pitcher of water piece of bread on bench then without word party left rupert sat quiet on bench for hour two before eye became sufficiently accustomed to darkness to see anything for feeblest ray of light made way through so small loophole in wall of such immense thickness governor be right muttered to month two of place must kill dog be not until next day that gaoler made appearance be not same who have hitherto attended powerful looking ruffian who be evidently under order a to silence such a have governed conduct of other well began how doe worship like new palace be hardly cheerful rupert said know that palace be ever particularly cheerful be fine fellow gaoler said looking at rupert by light of lantern noted yesterday a came down thought pity then that must not say what wanted to know what be want to when prisoner come down here be always because want to get something out of want to finish with for good see be below level of moat here water come at ordinary time to within six inch of slit up there in wet weather happens sometimes that stream feed moat swell if have be forgotten to open sluice gate of moat will rise ten foot before morning once knew prisoner drowned in cell above well rupert said calmly after one may a well be drowned a die by inch owe ill will must be almost glad if did for then must dash brain out against wall fight till have to bring soldier down to kill man gave surly growl have knife said just so rupert answered may be although think likely that might kill before knocked brain out must be just what must like repeat be only because have ill will towards that at once begin struggle must end in death one way gaoler said more be clear that rupert word have in slight degree impressed for be on future visit a civil a be within nature to be whenever wish to see governor will come to said to rupert one day if governor doe not come till send for rupert answered will never come even in dungeon where escape seemed hopeless rupert determined to do best to keep life strength together nothing death of king seemed likely to bring relief event might be many year distant when took place old friend must be sure endeavour in way to find out where be confined to obtain release at rate determined to live a long a must kept up spirit by singing scrap of old song strength by such gymnastic exercise a must carry out without aid of movable article at first struck out arm a if fighting so many hundred of time then took to walking on hand at last loosened one of stone formed top of bed invented sort of exercise with be day month said one day to gaoler be th of october be very dark rupert said darker than usual be raining jailer said raining tremendously late that night rupert be awoke by splashing of water leaped to foot cell be already foot deep in water have exclaimed be one thing other now rupert have be hoping for flood might bring death thought that be possible that might bring deliverance top of loophole be two half foot from vaulted roof top of door be about on same level six inch lower roof arched three foot above point whence sprang rupert have thought over concluded that be possible nay almost certain that even must water outside rise ten foot above level of roof sufficient air must be pent up there to prevent water from rising inside to supply with sufficient to breathe for many hour be more afraid of effect of cold than of being drowned felt that in flood in water be likely to be fairly warm congratulated that be now instead of in december that must have to pas through ordeal before commencing struggle kneeled for time in prayer on bed then with firm heart rose to foot awaited rising of water be rapid indeed be already two foot over bed minute by minute rose higher when reached chin did in le than quarter of hour from time when have first awoke swam across to loophole be now few inch above water through stream of water still poured impossible a be for human being to get through narrow slit iron bar have be placed across of rupert took hold remained quiescent a water mounted higher higher presently rose above top of loophole rupert now watched anxiously how fast ran floating on back keeping finger at water level against wall must feel that water still rose seemed to that rise be slower slower at last finger remained against point in stone for minute without moving rise of water inside dungeon have ceased that continued outside guessed by slight distinct feeling of pressure in air showing that column of water outside be compressing have fear of bad consequence from source a even height of twelve foot of water outside must not give unbearable pressure be more afraid that must exhaust air believed that there must be sufficient a knew that le exerted le air required floated quietly on back with foot resting on bar across loophole now two foot under water scarcely felt water cold rain have come from warm quarter temperature of water be actually higher than of cold humid dungeon hour after hour passed night appeared interminable from time to time rupert dived so a to look through loophole at last be rewarded by seeing faint dull light day be beginning rupert have doubt that with early morning sluice must be opened moat entirely cleared of water have when talking with gaoler one day asked how got rid of water in dungeon after flood man said that there be pipe from floor of dungeon into moat at ordinary time pipe be closed by wooden plug a water outside be far above floor that after flood water be entirely let out of moat plug removed from pipe thus emptied dungeon from way in fellow described various arrangement rupert have little doubt that sluice gate be at time purposely left closed in order to clear off troublesome prisoner who might otherwise have remained care expense to state for year to come long a night have seemed seemed even longer before rupert felt that water be sinking knew that after upper sluice have opened fosse might take time to fall to level of water inside dungeon that until did water inside must remain stationary passed hour by changing position a much a possible sometimes swam round round at other time trod water then must float quietly then cling to bar of loophole descent of water came upon at last a surprise be swimming round round have not for time touched wall when suddenly ray of light flashed in face gave cry of joy water have fallen below top of loophole swimming up to must see across fosse watch sunlight sparkling on water be two month since have seen light feeling of joy overpowered more than danger have faced rapidly water fell until be level with bottom of loophole then hour passed away for fosse must have to be emptied before drain leading from dungeon must be opened however rupert hardly felt time long with hand on bar in loophole remained gazing out at sunlight water in fosse sank sank until must no longer see must see sun glistening on wet grass of bank be satisfied at last be conscious of strain on arm withdrawing gaze from without saw that water have fallen six inch now sank rapidly in hour must stand with head above then be able to sit down on bed when water sank to depth of two foot again lay on back floated knew that thick deposit of mud must be left that be essential for plan that must drift to exit hole of water there be found with mud slime undisturbed by footstep movement ten minute lay on back on ground in corner of dungeon to water have floated having taken care towards end to sink head so that hair floated partly over a water drained off remained so guessed to be about midday expected to be left undisturbed until night after time slept when awoke be dark soon after heard step coming down stair now be moment of trial presently door opened four of gaoler came in bore between stretcher be fifth one said recognized voice of own attendant be pity be fine fellow well there be one more then job done bent over rupert who ceased breathing be only one with eye closed said expect there be someone must break heart if knew be lying here well lift up mate two month imprisonment in dungeon have done one good service for rupert absence of light have blanched face even have be dead must hardly have looked more white than did long hour in water have made hand deadly cold hair matted on face added to deathlike aspect put stretcher on ground roll over on to one of men said mind dead man be so clammy slimy that be horrible to touch there stand between wall put foot under roll over there nothing must be better now then off go with weight more than twice a much a others rupert lay with face down on stretcher felt carried upstairs then along several long passage then through door felt fresh evening air now by sound knew that be being carried over bridge across moat to burying ground then stretcher be laid down now then roll over into hole one said let go back for last peste be sick of job will need bottle of eau de vie to put straight again one side of stretcher be lifted rupert be rolled over fall be not deep three four foot only fell on soft mass whose nature must well guess at minute later heard retreating footstep of gaoler leaping from grave stood free man by side knew that be not only free safe from active pursuit for felt sure that gaoler when returned with last load must throw in fill up grave that suspicion that contained one short of number must arise in be immense advantage to for on escape of prisoner from loch event have happened once twice in record gun be fired whole country turned out in pursuit of prisoner rupert paused for two minute before commencing flight kneeling down thanked god for escape then climbed low rampart dropped beyond struck across country exercise soon sent blood dancing through hand again by morning be thirty five mile from loch have stopped once mile two after starting when came to stream into have waded have washed muck stain from clothes hair face with morning dawn clothes be dry presented to eye aspect similar to wore when captured at blois

off long hair set to work a miller man in week miller wife a well a miller be delighted with great strength willingness cheeriness kept a said place alive pallor of face have so far worn off by end of week that miller wife be satisfied that must a said soon look like human being not like walking corpse winter passed off quietly rupert stood higher higher in liking of worthy couple with whom lived climax being reached when in midwinter party of marauder for at time war of france distress of people have filled country with band of men who set law at defiance five in number came to mill demanded money miller who be not of warlike disposition must have given up earnings have stored away rupert took down old sword hung over fireplace sallying out ran through chief of party desperately wounded two others by sheer strength tossed others into mill stream standing over when scrambled out forcing to dig grave bury dead captain to carry off wounded comrade thus when spring came rupert said that must be going regret of miller wife be deep by offer of higher pay tried to get to stay rupert however be of course unable to accede to request be glad when received letter from son in army saying

took line must avoid paris other town at have ever shown sometimes tramped alone more often with other soldier who have be during winter on leave to recover from effect of wound of fever from talk rupert learned with satisfaction that campaign have missed have be very uneventful that great battle have taken place be expected that struggle must begin in few week must be desperate one side having made great effort to place predominating force in field a have idea of putting on french uniform even for day rupert resolved a approached army frontier to abandon story that be soldier going to take place in rank when reached amiens found street encumbered with baggage waggon taking up provision store to army driver have be pressed into service going into cabaret heard young fellow lamenting bitterly that have be dragged away from home when be in three week to have be married waiting until left rupert followed told that have heard what have said be ready to go a substitute if liked for minute two poor fellow must hardly believe good fortune when found that be in earnest be delighted hurried off to contractor in charge of train rupert stopping with by way to buy blouse in looked more fitted for post contractor seeing that rupert be far more powerful useful looking man than driver whose place offered to take made difficulty whatever in five minute rupert with metal plate with number hung round neck be walking by side of heavily loaded team while late driver with paper of discharge in pocket have started for home almost wild with delight for month rupert worked backwards forward between post depot a yet ally have not taken field knew that must have chance of crossing wide belt of country patrolled in direction by french cavalry at end of time infantry moved out from quarter took field allied army advanced towards french army under vendome numbered men while marlborough owing to intrigue of enemy at home dissension of ally be able to bring only into field french have correspondent in most of town in flanders where rapacity of dutch have exasperated people against new master made long for return of french plot be on foot to deliver antwerp to french vendome moved forward to take advantage of marlborough took post at halle vendome halted army at soignies three league distant considerable portion of force moved much closer to other lay watching other across valley mile wide rupert happened to be with waggon taking ammunition up to artillery in advanced position determined if possible to seize opportunity of rejoining countryman lane running between two high hedge led from foot of hill where be standing directly across valley rupert slipping away unnoticed made best of way down lane when nearly half across valley hedge ceased rupert issued out into open field hitherto knowing that have not be noticed have husbanded breath have only walked quickly a came into open started at run be already nearly half way between army reckoned that before of french cavalry must overtake must be within reach of succour by friend loud shout from behind showed that be seen looking round saw that french general officer accompanied by officer dragoon be out in front of line reconnoitring british position seeing fugitive set spur to horse to cut off rupert ran at top of speed must hear roar of encouragement from troop in front be assured that there be cavalry at part of line that must be overtaken long before must get within very short distance that then constituted musket range finding that escape be out of question slackened speed so a to leave breath for conflict be armed only with heavy stick younger officer better mounted anxious to distinguish on so conspicuous occasion be first to arrive rupert faced round cap have fallen off grasping small end of stick poised for attack french officer drew rein with sudden cry exclaimed what still alive yet thanks to monsieur le duc rupert said bitterly even loch must not hold companion be now close at hand with cry of fury duke rode at rupert latter gave horse sharp blow a duke sweeping blow descended animal reared suddenly disconcerting aim before foot touched ground heavy knob of rupert stick driven with whole strength of arm struck duke on forehead at same instant a duke fell lifeless mass over crupper rupert leaped to other side of horse placing animal between other assailant a swept down upon before must check horse vaulted into saddle with adroit wheel avoided rush of dragoon shout of army spectator of singular combat be now loud two frenchman attacked rupert furiously one on side with weapon stick rupert felt conflict to be hopeless with spring a sudden a with have mounted leapt to ground a general on one side dragoon on other cut at at same moment spring took close to horse of latter before amazed soldier must again strike rupert have vaulted on to horse behind then using immense strength strength brought to perfection by exercise at loch work in lifting sack a miller man seized with hand french soldier by belt lifted from seat threw backwards over head man flying through air yard before fell on ground with heavy crash driving heel into

asked did call majesty out did kiss madame de maintenon run away with maid of honour dozen laughing suggestion be made then rupert said gravely there be unfounded imputation be interfering with plan majesty have formed for marriage of lady gentleman of court rupert spoke so gravely that brother officer saw that joking here must be ill timed sly wink be exchanged a rupert changing subject went on to recount captivity at story of escape be listened to eagerly then rupert made long pause coloured lightly several thing of importance then happened said a be going through street of blois street of where colonel forbes asked in astonishment escape from lille just on frontier what on earth be doing down at blois hundred mile south of paris rupert paused again really can not explain colonel will make point of telling duke if considers that acted wrongly must bear displeasure matter be of real importance doe not greatly concern adventure forgive if feel justified in telling rest be plain sailing again narrative went on surprise at hearing that rupert have be confined at loch well known a prison for dangerous political offender be only exceeded by occasioned by incident of escape therefrom rupert carried on story to point of escape from french have just witnessed there be chorus of congratulation at having gone safely through such great danger dillon remarked appears to that have be wasting time gift most amazingly here have be absent just two year with exception of paltry marauder seem to have slain single frenchman till broke that officer skull today think friend that least can do be to pas formal vote of censure upon comrade for grievous waste of natural advantage only thing in favour be that seems to have be giving up whole attention to growing have got so prodigiously broad big now have again joined will be able to make up for otherwise sinful loss of time chorus of laughter greeted dillon proposal merry group then broke up went off to duty rupert first effort be to obtain such clothes a must enable to appear in place in rank without exciting laughter hugh told that clothes effect be in store at liege indeed be questionable whether must be of use to be not taller indeed than be two year before be broader by inch than before from quartermaster obtained pair of jack boot have belonged to trooper who have be killed in skirmish two day before from armourer got sword cuirass pistol a to riding breech there be trouble for several of officer have garment must fit for regimental coat must obtain nothing be in way large enough hugh be therefore

rupert gave three friend full account of adventure omitting of particular have not deemed expedient to speak of in public understand now lord fairholm said change in face struck be face changed rupert said doe not seem to have changed in face bit since joined six year ago be not in feature in expression look good tempered now rupert even merry when smile man must make mistake with now there be when be not speaking sort of intent look upon face intent determined expression seems to tell of great danger expected faced man must have gone through two month in dungeon of loch come out unchanged other danger have gone through always seem to be getting into danger of kind be comparatively sharp sudden sudden peril however great may not leave permanent mark two month in horrible den from other man must deem escape possible must not change when left although be twenty be in most thing still boy there be nothing boyish about now be same material have gone through fire be good iron very tough strong must be bent now rupert have be tried in furnace have come out steel be very good to say so rupert said smiling feel that change speak of hope that be just a much up to bit of fun a ever be at present strike perhaps a being more quiet see have hardly spoken to soul for eighteen month have got out of way rather do feel be have gained greatly in strength a unfortunate french trooper found to cost today there trumpet be sounding be too late for battle today so suppose have got march before chapter oudenarde trumpet call summoned rupert friend to horse be a suspected indication that there be general movement of troop in front vendome have declined to attack ally in position have taken up have moved by right to braine le leude village close to ground on more than hundred year later waterloo be fought whence threatened alike louvain brussels marlborough moved army on parallel line to anderleet sooner have arrived there than found that vendome be still moving towards right proof louvain be really object of attack again allied troop be set in motion night through torrent of rain tramped wearily along until at daybreak be in position at parc covering fortress of louvain vendome finding anticipated fell back to braine le leude without firing shot though marlborough have so far foiled enemy be clear that be not in condition to take offensive before arrival of prince eugene who must trusted be able to come to assistance for week army watched other without movement on th of july vendome suddenly marched from braine le leude intending to capture fortress of oudenarde small body of troop be sent off at same time to ghent bruges whose inhabitant rose admitted french marlborough seeing danger threatened very important fortress of oudenarde sent order to lord chandos who commanded at ath to collect small garrison in neighbourhood to throw into oudenarde be done before vendome must reach place be thus secured against coup de main vendome invested fortress brought up siege train from tournay moved towards lessines with main army to cover siege loss of ghent bruges annoyance suffered from party attack at home failure of ally to furnish promised contingent so agitated marlborough that be seized with attack of fever fortunately on th of july prince eugene arrived finding that army must not be up in time have left accompanied only by personal staff have ridden on to join marlborough arrival of able general congenial spirit did much to restore marlborough after council with prince determined to throw army upon vendome line of communication thus force to fight with face to paris at two in morning of th of july ally broke up camp advanced in four great column towards lessines french frontier by noon head of column have reached herfelingen fourteen mile from starting point bridge be thrown across dender next morning army crossed then stood between french own frontier vendome greatly disconcerted at finding that plan have be destroyed ordered army to fall back to gavre on scheldt intending to cross below oudenarde marlborough at once determined to press forward so a to force on battle having advantage of coming upon enemy when engaged in movement of retreat accordingly at daybreak on th colonel cadogan with advanced guard consisting of whole of cavalry twelve battalion of infantry pushed forward marched with speed to scheldt reached by seven o'clock having thrown bridge across marched to meet enemy troop in battle array infantry opposite eynes cavalry extending to left towards schaerken advancing strongly down river in order cadogan soon met french advanced guard under biron be moving up from gavre in fighting french have advantage retaining possession of eynes there awaiting advance of english meanwhile marlborough eugene with main body of army have reached river be engaged in getting troop across narrow bridge a yet small portion of force have crossed seeing vendome determined to crush british advanced guard with whole weight of army so halted troop formed order of battle country in battle of oudenarde be about to be fought be undulating cut up by several stream with hedgerow field enclosure altogether admirably adapted for army fighting defensive battle village of eynes lie about mile below oudenarde quarter of mile from scheldt through flow stream formed by junction of two rivulet at distance of about mile from scheldt almost parallel with river run norken considerable stream fall into scheldt below gavre behind river ground rise into high plateau in at commencement of fight greater portion of french army be posted appearance of colonel cadogan with advanced guard completely astonished french general ally be known to have be fifteen mile away on preceding evening that great army must march distance cross great river be in readiness to fight great battle be contrary to calculation of probability duke of burgundy wished to continue march to ghent marshal vendome pointed out that be too late that although country so intersected with hedge be unfavourable ground for army possessed larger mass of men yet that battle must be fought irresolution dissension on part of french general wasted time allowed ally to push large body of troop across river unmolested a fast a got over marlborough formed up near bevere village few hundred yard north of oudenarde marlborough then prepared to take offensive ordered colonel cadogan to retake eynes four english battalion under colonel sabine crossed stream attacked french force in village consisting of seven battalion under pfiffer while cavalry crossed rivulet higher up came down on flank of village result be three french battalion be surrounded made prisoner other four routed dispersed french general now saw that there be longer possibility of avoiding general action vendome must have stood on defensive a have norken with steep difficult ground in front be evidently proper tactic to have pursued be however overruled by duke of burgundy other general french accordingly descended from plateau crossed norken advanced to attack army be of nearly equal strength french having slightly advantage ally have battalion squadron in men french battalion squadron in men french again lost time fell into confusion a advanced owing to marshal vendome order being countermanded by duke of burgundy who have nominally chief command who be jealous of vendome reputation marlborough divined cause of hesitation perceiving that main attack must be made on left be posted in front of castle of bevere mile from village of same name ordered twelve battalion of infantry under cadogan to move from right at eynes to reinforce left then lined hedge with infantry stationing twenty british battalion under argyle with four gun in reserve awaited attack few gun be employed on side during battle for artillery in day moved slowly rapid movement of army have left gun far behind french in advance at once drew in four battalion posted at groenvelde in advance of eynes then bearing to right pressed forward with such vigour that drove back allied left at point be dutch hanoverian troop marlborough now dispatched eugene to take command of british on right directed count lottum to move from centre with twenty battalion to reinforce side of fight went to restore battle on left eugene with british troop be gradually steadily in spite of obstinate resistance being driven back when lottum reinforcement arrived with eugene advanced at once drove back enemy a be in disorder general natzmer at head of prussian cuirassier charged drove back until be fallen upon by french horse guard in reserve while infantry fire from hedgerow mowed down cuirassier so dreadful be fire prussian cavalry be slain rest escaped with difficulty hotly pursued by french household troop even more desperate conflict be time raging on left here marlborough placed at head of dutch hanoverian battalion led back against french who be advancing with shout of victory desperate struggle ensued alison in history say ground on hostile line met be so broken that battle in quarter turned almost into series of partial conflict even personal encounter bridge ditch wood hamlet enclosure be obstinately contested so incessant be roll of musketry so intermingled did hostile line become that field seen from distance appeared unbroken line of flame warmer fire more desperate series of combat be never witnessed in modern warfare be in great part conducted hand to hand like battle of antiquity of livy homer have left such graphic description cavalry must not act from multitude of hedge copse intersected theatre of conflict breast to breast knee to knee bayonet to bayonet maintained fight on side with most desperate resolution if resistance however be obstinate attack be le vigorous at length enthusiastic ardour of french yielded to steady valour of german gradually be driven back literally at bayonet point at length resisting at point yielded ground have won at commencement of action so gradually be pushed back a far a village of diepenbech where so stubborn stand be made that ally must no longer advance overkirk have now got rear of army across river duke seeing that hill of oycke flanked enemy position be unoccupied by directed veteran general with twenty dutch danish battalion to advance occupy arrived there swung round left of line so pressed french right be advanced beyond outer bound into little plain of diepenbech duke commanded overkirk to press round still further to left by pass of mullem mill of royeghem by french sustained communication with force still on plateau beyond norken prince eugene to further extend right so a to encompass mass of french crowded in plain of diepenbech night be falling now progress of ally on flank must be seen by flash of fire vendome seeing immense danger in right centre be placed endeavoured to bring up left hitherto intact increasing darkness thick enclosure determined resistance of eugene troop prevented from carrying out intention so far be british wing extended round plain of diepenbech that completely enclosed eugene be men meeting fought fiercely believing other to be french mistake be discovered to prevent further mishap of kind in darkness whole army be ordered to halt where be wait till morning have daylight lasted two hour longer whole of french army must have be slain taken prisoner a be greater portion made way through interval of allied army around fled to ghent nevertheless lost killed wounded prisoner while many thousand of fugitive made for french frontier thus total loss to vendome exceeded men while ally lost in when morning broke marlborough dispatched forty squadron of horse in pursuit of fugitive towards ghent sent off count lottum with thirty battalion fifty squadron to carry strong line enemy have constructed between ypres warneton employed rest of force in collecting tending wounded of army few day later two army that of eugene that of duke of berwick have be marching with speed parallel to other came up joined of marlborough vendome respectively duke of berwick corp be more powerful numbering thirty four battalion fifty five squadron raised duke de vendome army to over placed again fairly on equality with ally marlborough having by masterly movement forced vendome to fight with face to paris in retreat to retire still farther from frontier now have france open to counsel be that whole army must at once march for paris disregarding fortress just a wellington blucher did after waterloo be however overruled even eugene considering such attempt to be altogether too dangerous with vendome army strong in rear must be admitted must certainly have be march altogether without parallel finding that colleague must not consent to so daring adventurous march marlborough determined to enter france lay siege to immensely strong fortress of lille be in tremendous undertaking for fortification of town be considered most formidable ever designed by vauban citadel within town be still stronger garrison of picked troop be commanded by marshal boufflers one of most skillful general in french army to lay siege to fortress a while vendome with army of men lay ready to advance to assistance be undertaking of greatest magnitude in most case proper course to have taken must have be to advance against defeat vendome before undertaking siege of lille french general have entrenched position with such skill that must not be attacked while have advantage if ally stood between france stood between base commanded scheldt canal from holland be therefore in position to interfere greatly with onerous operation of bringing up store for british army with passage to front of immense siege train requisite for operation of such magnitude a be now about to be undertaken for whose transport alone horse be required chapter siege of lille british cavalry suffered le severely at oudenarde than did of other allied nationality a be during greater portion of day held in reserve rupert of special friend in regiment be wounded be however greatly grieved at death of sir john loveday who be killed by cannonball at commencement of action two of captain in th be also killed gave rupert step must have have captain rank long before have accepted duke offer several time repeated of post on staff

taking house adele joined voice with of others in saying that must be cruel indeed for to take away from chace until be time for rupert to start for war again in middle of march received order to join regiment a large number of recruit have be sent out officer be required at post during winter of marlborough have laboured strenuously to obtain peace must satisfy party louis offered great concession duke urged strongly must be accepted english dutch wanted term so severe humiliating that louis must not accept side prepared for great final struggle king of france addressed appeal to people telling that have offered to make greatest possible sacrifice to obtain peace for that enemy demanded term must place france at mercy therefore appealed to patriotism to come forward to save country people responded readily to summons marshal villars took field in spring with men force just equal to of ally french have taken up position of such extraordinary strength that be hopeless for ally to attempt to attack left wing be covered by stream of roubaix centre by marsh of cambriu right by canal between douai lille naturally strong position have be so strengthened by artificial inundation ditch abattis earthwork a to be practically impregnable marlborough eugene made however a if must attack villars called to a many men a must be spared from garrison round ally then by sudden night march arrived before tournai at once commenced investment tournai be immensely strong town garrison be weak heavy artillery be brought up from ghent on th of july approach be commenced on th of month governor finding that ally be gradually winning fort after fort that villars made movement to relieve surrendered town retired into citadel be then besieged be one of most terrible siege ever undertaken for not only be fortification enormously strong beneath bastion outwork far extending beyond immense number of gallery have be driven for mine at time soldier even bravest have found difficult to withstand panic brought about by explosion of mine by underground warfare in bravery strength be alike unavailing where bravest a well a most cowardly be liable at moment to be blown into air smothered underground danger of service at time great be immensely aggravated by extraordinary pain taken by who have constructed fortification to prepare for subterranean warfare by construction of gallery miner frequently met underground breaking into other gallery sometimes troop mistaking friend for foe fought with other sometimes whole company entered mine by mistake at very moment that be primed for explosion be often drowned suffocated with smoke buried alive sometimes score be blown into air be not surprising that even heart of allied troop be appalled at new extraordinary danger have to face at siege of tournai bravest be indeed exposed to greatest danger first to mount breach to effect lodgment in outwork to enter newly discovered mine be sure to perish first there be low rumbling noise then earth heaved whole company be scattered with frightful explosion on th of august sally made by besieged be bravely repulsed besieger pressing closely upon effected lodgment immediately mine be sprung men blown into air on th besieged blew down wall overhung sap two officer thirty four soldier be killed on rd mine sixty foot long twenty foot broad be discovered just a whole battalion of hanoverian troop have taken up place above be congratulating on narrow escape when mine placed below have discovered exploded burying in upper mine in ruin on th men posted in large mine have be discovered be similarly destroyed by explosion of mine below same night men posted in ditch be killed by wall being blown out upon in resisting attack upon one side of fortress only thirty eight mine be sprung in twenty six day almost one with fatal effect be detriment to courage of troop to say that shrank appalled before such sudden terrible mode of warfare marlborough eugene in person visited trench braved danger in order to encourage men at last on rd of september garrison reduced to men surrendered be permitted to march out with honour of war to return to france on promise not to serve again siege cost ally men chapter malplaquet end of war during time that ally have be employed upon siege of tournai marshal villars have laboured to form impregnable line of entrenchment barring farther advance marlborough however day two previously to fall of tournai sent off prince of hesse cassel who by rapid most masterly march fell upon french line at part where french have expectation of there being enemy within thirty mile of opposition be made prince marching rapidly to plateau of jemappes invested mon on french side rest of army followed effect caused throughout france indeed through europe by success of masterly movement be immense be evident that great battle be at hand villars moved army rapidly up detachment of eugene troop be left to watch mon allied army strong advanced to meet on night of th bivouacked in line three mile long five from occupied by french marshal villars have with men force therefore be a nearly a possible equal ally have gun against eighty of french position taken up by villars be of great natural strength being plateau interspersed with wood intersected with stream elevated from hundred fifty to two hundred foot above meadowland of trouville across assailant must pas malplaquet stood on plateau on slope from plateau to plain wood be extremely thick only access to plateau for troop be two clearing cut through wood known a trouees de la louviere d'aulnoit on morning of th when french definitely took up position marlborough eugene be in favour of making instant attack before french must add to great natural strength of position by entrenchment dutch deputy however be altogether opposed to assault on so formidable front finally compromise be adopted compromise a be often case be very worst course must have be adopted army must neither fall back a dutch wished attack at once a marlborough desired be resolved not to abandon siege of mon to attack enemy if must not take offensive to wait until saint ghislain commanded passage on haine be taken until twenty six battalion on march from tournai arrived be two day before condition be fulfilled villars have used two precious day in throwing up series of immensely strong work height occupied formed concave semicircle enfilading on side little plain of malplaquet semicircle now bristled with redoubt palisade abattis stockade while two trouees opening by be presumed that ally must endeavour to force entrance be so enfiladed by cross battery a to be well nigh unassailable french army by turn have laboured ceaselessly at work during two day cowardly folly of dutch deputy have given result be work resembled rather fortification of fortress than ordinary field work marlborough eugene have seen from hour to hour progress of formidable work resolved to mask front attack by strong demonstration on enemy rear troop coming up from tournai under general withers be ordered not to join main army to cross haine at saint ghislain to attack extreme left of enemy at farm of la folie baron schulemberg be to attack left flank of entrenchment in wood of taisniere with forty of eugene battalion supported by a many cannon while count lottum be to attack right flank of wood with twenty two battalion rest of army be to attack in front be from eugene attack in wood of taisniere that success be chiefly hoped at three o'clock on morning of th men be got under arm divine service be performed at head of regiment then troop marched to post assigned to in attack army be confident french enthusiastic ally relied on unbroken series of victory never once since war begun have suffered defeat with eugene a well a marlborough with felt confident of power to carry position even to eye of least instructed soldier be yet formidable in extreme french be confident in being commanded by best most popular general villars boufflers be strong in enthusiasm king appeal have communicated to whole nation considered absolutely impossible for enemy to carry wonderful series of work that have erected at half past seven be ready fog have hitherto hung over low ground cleared up two army came into view of other artillery on side opened heavy fire whole line advanced left be halted for awhile while count lottum with twenty two battalion formed in three line attacked right of wood of taisniere schulemberg with whom be eugene attacked left without firing single shot schulemberg men marched through storm of grape swept until within twenty pace of entrenchment when musketry fire of french troop be so terrible that attacking column recoiled two hundred yard where be steadied brought back to charge by heroic effort of eugene who exposed in front of line while conflict be raging austrian battalion have formed extreme right of schulemberg corp have be unable to advance owing to deep marsh stole round unperceived into northeastern angle of wood of taisniere be soon in conflict with french lottum division have with immense bravery crossed deep morass under tremendous fire stormed portion of entrenchment villars who be directly in rear led on fresh brigade who drove back assailant marlborough then charged at head of d'auvergne cavalry of lottum battalion again forced way in meanwhile withers be quietly making way through wood from la folie have made considerable progress before french must muster in force at point a threatened rear of front position villars fell back from entrenchment in front of wood took up second far stronger position have prepared on high ground on left even more desperate fight have be raging prince of orange commanded here prince be full of courage impetuosity troop under be dutch auxiliary in dutch pay among scotch brigade under marquis of tullibardin corp advanced in most gallant manner scotch dutch rivalling other in bravery two line of enemy entrenchment be carried at bayonet have there be reserve at hand battle must have be won at point prince have thrown whole force into attack forty battalion be opposed by seventy french battalion while assailant be swept by fire from high ground tullibardin general spau be killed assailant fighting with extraordinary obstinacy be yet driven back with loss of killed twice a many wounded french sallied out to attack prince of hesse cassel charged with cavalry drove back into work news of terrible slaughter repulse on right brought eugene marlborough from centre left where be going well reserve be brought up battle restored news now came that villars alarmed at progress made on left by withers have withdrawn irish brigade other of best troop from centre to drive back ally right eugene galloped off with haste to lead right hurry forward while marlborough directed lord orkney to attack weakened french centre with strength ordered cavalry to follow on heel of infantry fight on right be fierce indeed for here villars eugene alike led men be wounded villars in knee refused to leave field insisted on being placed in chair where must see battle cheer on men agony suffered however great loss of blood weakened so that at last fainted be carried off field command devolving on marshal boufflers eugene be wounded in head in vain staff pressed to retire in order that wound might be dressed if be to die here said of what use to dress wound if survive will be time enough in evening so with blood streaming over shoulder kept place at head of troop who animated by example heroism rushed forward with such impetuosity that work be carried in centre even more decisive advantage have be gained lord orkney made attack with such vigour that entrenchment weakened by force have be withdrawn be carried horse following close behind broke through opening of work spread over plateau cutting down fugitive gun in work be wheeled round opened tremendous fire on dense mass of french drawn up behind other part of entrenchment thrown into confusion by fire french began to waver marlborough gave order for great battery of forty gun in allied centre to advance advanced up hill passed through entrenchment opened fire right left upon french although french still strove gallantly battle be now virtually over centre be pierced right turned boufflers prepared to cover necessary retreat with cavalry with picked horseman of royal horse guard charged allied cavalry when scattered blown by pursuit drove back be repulsed by fire of orkney infantry fell back leaving force dead on plain again again boufflers brought up fresh cavalry executed most desperate charge to cover retreat of infantry who be now falling back along whole line a prince of orange benefiting by confusion have now carried entrenchment on french left boufflers formed infantry into three great mass fell back in good order in direction of bavai such be victory of malplaquet victory indeed won at cost that few more such success must have be ruin ally have gained french position have driven enemy from field have prevented raising of siege of mon great object of french beyond advantage be slight for enemy retired in good order be ready to have fought again if attacked on following day ally captured fourteen gun twenty five standard french carried off thirty two standard principally dutch french lost men in killed wounded ally fully french historian have done full justice to extraordinary bravery of allied troop one of officer wrote after battle eugene marlborough ought to be well satisfied with on day since up to time have not met with resistance worthy of may now say with justice that nothing can stand before indeed what must be able to stay rapid progress of hero if army of men of best troop strongly posted between two wood trebly entrenched performing duty a well a brave men must do be not able to stop one day will not then own with that surpass hero of former age siege of mon be now undertaken after month gallant defence fell two army then went into winter quarter there remaining now only fortress of valenciennes between ally paris rupert holliday be not present with army at siege of mon have distinguished greatly in desperate cavalry fight took place upon plateau after british infantry have forced way in more than once fighting in front of regiment have be cut off surrounded when allied cavalry gave way before valiant charge of french cavalry time strength weight skill with wielded long heavy sword carried enabled to cut way through enemy rank to rejoin regiment have not however come off scatheless having received several severe sabre cut hugh have also be wounded rupert readily obtained leave to retire to england to be cured of wound duke of marlborough raising to rank of colonel on field of battle have during campaign received many letter from adele who told that marquis have taken house to inquiry that rupert made a to locality either did not answer question at returned evasive answer knew be that be staying at chace that marquis be away seeing to renovation of house be not until rupert returned that obtained clue to little mystery marquis de pignerolles have bought haugh formerly property of sir william brownlow intended estate a dowry for pignerolles estate be indeed very large two three year of saving be sufficient not only to purchase estate to add to redecorate refurnish house madame holliday handed over to rupert title deed of whole of windthorpe estate owned by a income from saving be more than enough to maintain at windthorpe chace one only condition marquis exacted with dowry be that combined estate must after rupert finally came into possession of chace be known not a haugh a windthorpe chace be at windthorpe chace dear rupert that first knew drew sword for adele name be dear to a to be only right must unite two estate since prevented union ten year ago be in treaty now for small estate two mile on other side of derby so until king forgives dy will be near wedding did not take place quite so soon a

dillon father rupert have written over to say how glad must be to see at marriage that must not think of asking to come so far mynheer van duyk have however written to say that daughter must certainly come for regarding rupert a son must be extraordinary indeed for to be absent so arrived at chace two day before wedding on morning before going to church presented rupert with cheque simply astounded young soldier at first indeed absolutely refused to accept merchant however insisted so strongly upon urging that own wealth be so large that a have only maria to inherit be really beyond want even power to spend that have ever since rupert saved maria from attempt of sir richard fulke for must have succeeded regarded a adopted son rupert saw that refusal must really give pain therefore with warm gratitude accepted cheque whose value exceeded that of united estate of haugh chace maria brought magnificent set of jewel for adele not indeed that young lady in way required for marquis have
