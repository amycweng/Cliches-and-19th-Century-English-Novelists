of result be that be regarded with great respect have doubt that have saved from much trouble for native have almost got to believe that only have to point gun man wish to kill fall dead however far distant two day after departure of mr brooke brother stanley started down hoogly in native trader be curious looking craft uncle yes must not be called handsome in home water be uncommonly fast find much more convenient in many way than british merchantman be yours uncle be not mine exactly charter work principally for see wage be so low that can work craft like for next to nothing why captain eight men together get higher pay than boatswain of english trader captain owns vessel be quite content if get few rupee month in addition to what considers own rate of pay wife two child live on board if craft can earn twenty rupee week considers that be doing splendidly at outside must not pay men more than four rupee month suppose that must put down service at eight so must leave forty rupee month a profit earned by ship in point of fact keep going pretty steadily make trip backwards forward between different depot carry up river for considerable distance doe little trade on own account not in good such a sell know purely native store take little freight when can get generally few native passenger pay fifteen rupee week suppose earns from five to ten in addition so that arrangement suit admirably keep stern cabin for a see have four little brass gun picked up for song at calcutta there be twenty four musket aft be arrangement that crew be to practise shooting once week so have come to be pretty fair shot captain can send two pound shot from little gun uncommonly straight will be amused when see practising for action captain wife two boy load gun do very quickly too run round from gun to gun take aim fire crew shout yell bang away with musket take command give few pice among if firing have be accurate have be attacked once twice in upper water have always managed to beat robber off without much difficulty captain fire away till get pretty close pepper with rifle have three of when get within fifty yard crew open fire a have three musket can make very hot for pirate have store of hand grenade if push on throw two three on board when get within ten yard have always finished matter understand thing bursting in middle of mean to say that armament must be of much use if be trading along coast of malay peninsula among island be quite enough to deal with petty robber of river thought that have boat that went up river in uncle yes tow rowboat store boat up behind craft a far a can go be a long a have wind enough to make against sluggish stream when can go further take to rowboat have eight rower carry gun be twelve pounder howitzer have have cut short so that be only about foot long of course wo carry far be not necessary charge be pound of powder ten pound bag of bullet at couple of hundred yard ball scatter enough to sweep two three canoe coming abreast a can charge fire little thing three time in minute be that require for practical purpose be only on few of river go up that there be fear of trouble on river from sylhet to east branch in kathee a be sometimes called kasi country be comparatively settled goomtee beyond oudypore be well enough until get into kaayn be what call independent be to say owns authority village be peaceable well disposed while others be savage same may be said of munnoo fenny river for last two year have done good deal of trade in up brahmaputra river a far a rungpoor there be great many village on bank people be quiet peaceable then go further south than chittagong uncle burmese hold aracan on south indeed for distance north of there be very clearly defined border see great river run from rangoon very nearly due north though with little east in extends along at back of district trade with so that burmese be not very far from manipur indeed stand on branch of irrawaddy of branch run nearly up to rungpoor will have big trouble with one of day indeed have have trouble already see burmese be great increasing power have so easily conquered neighbour that regard a invincible until beginning of eighteenth century burmese be master of pegu then people of country with help of dutch portuguese threw off yoke burmese be not long kept down for in alompra hunter gathered force round after keeping up irregular warfare for time be joined by so many of countryman that attacked captured ava conquered whole of pegu in english trading colony at negrais be massacred however be not act of alompra of treachery of frenchman named levine of armenian who incited burmese of district to exterminate english hoping doubt thus to retrieve in new quarter fortune of france in india be being extinguished by genius of clive english be at time far too occupied with desperate struggle be having in india to attempt to revenge massacre of countryman at negrais very rapidly burman power spread captured valuable tenasserim coast from siam repulsed formidable invasion from china annexed aracan dominated manipur thus became master of whole tract of country lying between china hindustan a now bordered upon territory mission be sent in to from india with proposal for settlement of boundary for arrangement of trade between two country nothing came of for burmese have already proposed to conquest of india considered mission a proof of terror that advance have inspired among after conquest by of aracan in there have be constant irritation felt against by burmese owing to fact that great number of fugitive from country have taken refuge in swamp island of chittagong from from time to time issued made raid against burmese in fugitive in alliance with predatory chief invaded aracan in force being joined by subject population there expelled burmese however soon reconquered province affair be nevertheless unfortunate since burmese naturally considered that a insurrection have begun with invasion by fugitive in chittagong have be fomented by be in way fact have force there capable of keeping mass of fugitive in order did best arrested many of leader when returned after defeat however be far from satisfying burmese mission be sent to ava to assure of friendly intention that have have nothing to do with invasion must do must to prevent recurrence burmese government declined to receive mission have much trouble with insurgent for fearful of re entering burma after defeat now carried on series of raid in territory be not until that be finally suppressed nevertheless court of ava remained dissatisfied fresh demand be raised for surrender of chief who have be captured of whole of fugitive living in government of chittagong marquis of hastings replied that british government must not without violation of principle of justice deliver up who have sought protection that tranquillity now existed there be probability of renewal of disturbance that greatest vigilance must be used to prevent punish author of raid might be attempted against aracan year later second letter be received demanding on part of king cession of ramoo chittagong moorshedabad dacca be to say of whole british possession east of ganges lord hastings simply replied that if be possible to suppose that demand have be dictated by king of british government must be justified in regarding a declaration of war to burmese made reply doubtless have heard of success have gained in central india have learned that whole force be disposable against three year ago old king died more warlike monarch succeeded since have be mixed up in trouble have be going on in assam where civil war have be raging one party other have sought assistance fighting have be going on there nearly incessantly two month ago burmese settled question by taking possession of whole country have of course be serious blow to although disorder have reigned have not interfered with trading along bank of river now that burmese have set up authority will for time anyhow be obliged to give up operation there for have evinced considerable hostility to have made raid near rungpoor on side of river have pulled down british flag on island in brahmaputra have taken in consequence principality of cachar under protection indeed two prince seeing that burmese be beginning to invade country invited to take step thus occupy pass from manipur into low country of sylhet wonder that have be able to trade in manipur uncle a burmese have be master there be not trading with capital burmese have be too occupied with affair in assam to exercise much authority in country besides see there have not be war between two country merchant at rangoon still carry on trade up irrawaddy in assam spring only trouble have be that have to pay somewhat higher toll than have done before however now that cachar be under protection hope that will make up for loss of trade in assam by doing better than before in province thought called kathee uncle so be generally named a be spoken of a cachar in proclamation assuming protectorate suppose will be called so in future name out here be spelt pretty much according to fancy while conversation have be going on boat have be running fast down river passing several european vessel almost a if have be standing still must not have thought that boat like must pas large ship stanley said have good deal to learn in art of sailing yet uncle replied great many of indian dhow can run away from square rigged ship in light weather know whether be line of hull cut of sail there be doubt about speed seem to skim over water while bluff bowed craft shove way through suppose day will adopt long sharp bow when do will make wonderful difference in rate of sailing then too craft have very light draft of water on other hand have deep keel help to lie close to wind that long overhanging bow render capital craft in heavy weather for a meet sea rise over gradually instead of hitting full on bow a doe ship have much to learn yet in way of ship building trader have own servant with man now came up said that meal be ready at once entered cabin be roomy comfortable be like rest of boat of varnished teak there be large window in stern have table with two fixed bench there be broad low sofa on side above musket be disposed in rack while at end by door be tom pearson own rifle four brace of pistol couple of sword ten long spear be suspended from roof of cabin in sling floor like rest of cabin be varnished look very comfortable uncle yes see live quite half time on board rest being spent in boat man be capital cook come from chittagong be mug be mug uncle be original inhabitant of aracan be one of who remained there after burmese have conquered speaks language a well a own recommend to begin with at once if thing settle down in assam will be very useful for in arranging with burmese official wo find very easy though of course knowledge of three four indian tongue will help be said to be mixture of old talus sanscrit tartar chinese tartar chinese word will of course be quite new to other two element will resemble that be familiar with talk to man in hindustani picked up little of at chittagong have learned good deal more during two year that have be with through will be able to learn week later dhow entered harbour stanley have passed most of time in conversation with khyen tom servant facility tongue have acquired in indian language be of great benefit to speedily picked up good many burmese sentence for next six month continued with uncle work latter have carried on enjoyed much sailed up sluggish river with low flat shore in dhow towing rowboat store boat behind crew of boat lived on board dhow until service be required helping in navigation aiding crew when wind dropped sweep be got out village along bank be for most part small be very numerous at of dhow brought up there be in almost case sufficient water to allow of being moored alongside bank a soon a did so native came on board to make purchase dispose of produce in addition to european indian good carried dhow be laden with rice for there be considerable demand at most of village a soon a have learned price of various good equivalent in product of country stanley did much of bartering while uncle went ashore talked with head men of village with of whom made point of keeping on good term so securing great portion of trade might otherwise have be carried by native craft three time during six month dhow have gone back to calcutta to fetch fresh supply of good to take in cargo of rice while trader proceeded higher up river in own boat while on voyage stanley always have rifle fowling piece that uncle have handed over for special use leaning against bulwark close at hand frequently shot waterfowl be so abundant that be able to keep not only own table supplied to furnish crew boatman with considerable quantity of food have have trouble with river pirate for have suffered so heavily in previous attack upon dhow that shunned repetition of loss at same time precaution be taken for owing to intestine trouble in cachar assam fugitive belonging to party happened for time to be worsted be driven to take refuge in jungle near river to subsist largely on plunder local authority being too feeble to root out boat therefore be always anchored in middle of stream at night two men be kept on watch to south a well a in north trading operation be more restricted for burmese became more more aggressive elephant hunter in hill formed boundary of british territory to east be seized carried off twenty three in one place being captured six in being ill treated imprisoned remonstrance of indian government treated with contempt by rajah of aracan be evident that object of burmese be to posse of hill country in order that might if chose pour down at time into cultivated country round town of ramoo there be doubt stanley said uncle one day will very shortly have big war with burmese fact that constant act of aggression be met only by remonstrance on part increase arrogance be convinced that be in mortal terror of say that in leader be openly boasting that ere long will drive completely from india one of general have confidently declared that after taking india intend to conquer england with such ignorant people there be one argument understood namely force sooner later will have to give hearty thrashing that will be quiet for time still grant that difficulty be great country be tremendous size beggar be brave climate at rate near sea coast be horribly unhealthy altogether will be big job will have to be done in very short time will see marching against calcutta chapter outbreak of war on last day of september just year after stanley have joined uncle dhow sailed into chittagong have now taken place of sylhet a trader chief depot latter place being too near burmese in assam for to care about keeping large stock of good there went ashore a soon a dhow cast anchor stanley remaining on board fat be in fire stanley tom pearson said when returned burmese have attacked killed of troop be certain that government can not put up with where be uncle down at mouth of naaf a know be southern boundary of province there be row there in january one of native boat laden with rice be coming up river on side of channel when armed burmese boat came across demanded duty of course fellow said be in own water whereupon burmese fired upon killed steersman there be report then that body of burmese troop be moving about on side of river that be feared must cross over burn of village accordingly guard at mouth of river be increased to fifty men few of be posted on island of shapuree island lie close to shore indeed channel between can be forded at low water have always formed part of province of chittagong there have never be question raised by burmese a to however viceroy of aracan called upon resident here to withdraw guard asserting right of king of ava to island since then letter have passed to fro hear that burmese have settled question by landing on shapuree one night last week attacked post there killed wounded four of sepoys drove rest off island indian government have put up with great deal rather than engage in so costly difficult operation a war with burma be impossible that can stand indian government however used endeavour to avert necessity for war although rajah of aracan lost time in writing letter to government of calcutta stating that have occupied island of shapuree that unless submitted quietly to act of justice city of dacca moorshedabad must be forcibly seized in order however to postpone at rate outbreak of war government of bengal resolved to give court of ava opportunity to withdraw from position taken up therefore acted a if attack on guard at shapuree have be action of viceroy of aracan alone addressed declaration to burmese government recapitulating fact of case pointing out that shapuree have always be acknowledged by burma a forming part of province of chittagong calling upon government to disavow action of local authority burmese considered a be in fact proof that government of india be reluctant to enter upon contest with confirmed burma in confident expectation of annexing eastern portion of bengal if not of expelling english altogether in meantime shapuree have be reoccupied by burmese after driving out little garrison have retired two month after attack two company of th native infantry arrived by sea from calcutta landed there stockade be built two six pounder placed in position company be stationed on mainland planet three gunboat carrying twelve pounder be stationed in river burmese at once collected large body of troop in aracan assam government of bengal made preparation to defend frontier especially position in north a advance of burmese in direction must not only threaten important town of dacca moorshedabad must place invader in dangerous proximity to calcutta accordingly portion of th rd native infantry four company of rungpoor local force be marched to sylhet outpost thrown forward to frontier seeing that burmese operation must probably commence in north tom pearson have after completing arrangement at chittagong sailed north to remove depot from sylhet other place must be exposed to attack from direction reached sylhet first week in january by time stanley from constant conversation with uncle servant have come to speak burmese a fluently a indian language be now nearly sixteen tall for age active owing to hot climate absence of vigorous exercise be le broad muscular than most english lad of age found on landing that news have arrived two day before powerful army of burmese have entered cachar from manipur have defeated troop of jambhir sing that burmese assamese have advanced from assam into cachar have begun to stockade at bickrampore at foot of bhortoka pas that third division be crossing into district of jyntea immediately to north of sylhet there be complete panic in town ryots be flocking in from surrounding country with family belonging be making way down country in boat to dacca be afraid stanley there be end of trade for present what see here be doubtless taking place over cachar must be just a bad down at chittagong be heavy blow for have done remarkably well year be building up foundation for good business doubt when trouble be over will be able to take up again may be if thrash burmese heartily be sure to do in long run may even prove benefit still there be doubt that be very bad business for however a just at present there be nothing whatever to be done propose a soon a good be on board to take holiday go out have look at fighting will take with uncle stanley asked eagerly certainly lad mean to do fighting ourselves only to look on may be that after be over may be able to make useful if want to ask question of burmese prisoner think that there be chance of beating must think not though of course there be saying still think fellow will be able to stand against troop of course have idea whatever of style of fighting have never met really formidable foe so that imagine will make pretty short work of however a will be mounted for will hire couple of horse there have be plenty of driven into town will be able to make bolt of if necessary of course will take rifle pistol with good be not placed on board dhow in what be called store boat a trader have determined to take up abode in rowboat must move about much faster than dhow to allow captain of craft to make good thing of by taking down to dacca a many of fugitive a must hold finding that burmese division have entered jyntea be intrenching at few mile distance major newton officer commanding on sylhet frontier concentrated force at jatrapur village five mile beyond sylhet boundary tom pearson have introduced to major newton asked permission to accompany force saying that nephew must be able if necessary to communicate with burmese before after action that must willingly act a aide de camp offer be accepted with thanks rode out with on evening of th of january to jatrapur at one o'clock in morning troop be roused marched hour later at daybreak came in sight of stockade few shot be at once fired upon advanced guard by burmese portion of force be lying in village hard by major newton at once divided command into two body one of be led by captain johnston against front of stockade other under captain rowe attacked village adjoining burmese stationed there gave way after very faint resistance be accustomed to rely always on stockade attack upon when not so protected shook at once in stockade however made resolute resistance captain rowe after gaining possession of village seeing occupant in full flight moved force to aid other division burmese dispirited by defeat of countryman finding attacked on two side gave way fled leaving hundred dead behind while on british side six sepoys be killed burmese fled to hill at speed rendered pursuit hopeless by more heavily armed troop fugitive soon rallied effected junction with division advancing from manipur after action major newton returned to sylhet few day later mr scott who have be appointed commissioner arrived there advancing to bhadrapur opened communication with burmese a however became evident that latter be only negotiating in order to gain time to intrench near jatrapur to have returned again placed matter in hand of military commander burmese force amounted to about six thousand men have erected strong stockade on bank of river surma have thrown bridge across to connect captain johnston advanced with wing of th native infantry company of rd native infantry small party of men of local corp small a be force divided into two party one of under captain rowe crossed river then moved against enemy burmese opened fire a advanced sepoys marched gallantly forward drove enemy out of unfinished intrenchment at point of bayonet assam division retreated hastily to bhortoka pas while manipur force stockaded at assam division be first attacked stockade carried at point of bayonet lieutenant colonel bowen who now commanded then moved against position at doodpatnee be very strong steep hill covered rear while other face of intrenchment be defended by deep ditch fourteen foot wide with chevaux de frise of pointed bamboo on outer edge although position be attacked with great gallantry be too strong to be captured by so small force be obliged to withdraw to jatrapur with loss of one officer killed four wounded about one hundred fifty sepoys killed wounded however bravery have not be without effect for burmese evacuated stockade retreated to manipur leaving cachar free from invader thus in le than three week burmese invasion of northern province have be hurled back by british force of le than tenth of of invader stanley uncle have be present at engagement in absence of cavalry have done good service in conveying message despatch lad have several time acted a interpreter between officer burmese prisoner received letter from commissioner thanking for assistance that have rendered that last affair be unfortunate stanley be evident that stockade of theirs be nasty place to attack that ought to be breached by gun before men be sent forward to storm however a burmese have gone repulse doe not matter much well felt sure that must thrash certainly gave credit for having great deal more pluck than have shown a be if there be nothing fresh take place here native little trader will soon be coming back from dacca business will be better than before for burmese have be talking so big for last three year that one have bought more than must just carry on while now will be more inclined to lay in good stock of good tomorrow will start for chittagong see have considerable store there there be chance of much more serious fighting in quarter than little affair have seen governor of aracan have along be source of trouble may expect that will cross into province at head of large force may do immense deal of damage before can get enough troop there to oppose descending river coasted along until arrived early in march at chittagong found that great alarm reigned there in january bandoola greatest military leader of burmese who be known to have be one of most strenuous supporter of war policy at court of ava have arrived at aracan taken command of troop collected there have brought with considerable reinforcement wanton outrage have be committed by burmese showed how intent be upon hostility owing to unhealthiness of islet of shapuree sepoys stationed there have be withdrawn company pilot vessel sophia be ordered to join gunboat off island four deputy from burmese court arrived at mungdoo on opposite shore invited commander of sophia to come on shore in order that might talk over with in friendly way situation of affair unsuspectingly accepted invitation landed accompanied by officer native seaman party be at once seized sent prisoner to aracan where be detained for month then sent back to mungdoo wanton insult be followed by formal declaration of war by government of india similar document be issued by court of force at sylhet be reinforced that in chittagong increased consisted of wing of th of th native regiment battalion of rd with local levy amounting in to men of wing of rd with two gun portion of native levy be posted at ramoo be point most threatened by invasion from aracan be in north hostility first commenced force moving into assam driving burmese before several sharp blow be dealt enemy have not be for setting in of wet season must have be driven entirely out of assam think stanley uncle said after have be short time at chittagong have better go up to ramoo see about matter there of course until burmese move can not say what game be likely to be will be a well to get store ready for embarkation in case must advance in direction if do so get everything on board at once can then be guided by circumstance a dhow came in yesterday can spare boat will of course ship good here on board big craft even if burmese come way have fear of taking town will of course lend hand in defence if attempt can do same at ramoo if like be chatting with colonel shatland yesterday tell that large fleet have be collected that expedition will be sent to capture rangoon so in case be likely that bandoola force will march off in direction think government be wrong will be impossible for troop to move when wet season once set in will lose tremendous lot of men from sickness if be cooped up in rangoon have very much better have sent few thousand men down here to act on defensive repel attempted invasion until rain be over when must have be shipped again join expedition against rangoon seems to mad headed thing to begin at present time of year have put up with insult of burmese for so long that might just a well have waited for favourable season before began operation in earnest accordingly on following day stanley started south for ramoo on arriving there took charge of trading operation shortly after meeting captain noton who commanded there in street recognized a officer who have be stationed at same cantonment a father whom have four year previously known well recognize captain noton said be son of captain brooke of rd certainly did not recognize officer said be glad to meet again let think yes name be stanley regular young pickle used to be what on earth be doing here of course heard of poor father death be grieved indeed at loss where be mother be well hope went back to england with sister two month after father death joined uncle brother be trader carry on business in district between here sylhet trading principally on river of course war have put stop to for present saw fighting up in north then came down to district have remained at chittagong be in charge of good here speak burmese fairly now if can be of use to will be very glad to be so there be not much business here parsee clerk who be generally in charge can look after very well acted a interpreter with troop in north have letter from mr scott commissioner thanking for service remember used to be able to talk four five of native language how did come to pick up burmese from servant of uncle thought that there must be sure to be war sooner later that after be over there must be good chance of profitable trade on burmese river have great difficulty in learning from uncle man who be native of aracan have doubt will find very useful what big fellow have grown stanley at least a far a height be concerned let see how old be now be past sixteen stanley replied have have several touch of fever caught suppose from damp on river think that be pretty well acclimatized now know look very strong have not have much active exercise of course climate be against very much so wonder that have kept health a well a have in steamy climate be going to mess room now have better come lunch with will introduce to other officer be very strong in comparison to force for counting assistant surgeon there be ten of will be very glad sir stanley said have certainly be feeling rather lonely here for know one there be very little to do during last year have often gone up one of river by there have always be occupation while at present thing be at standstill tell what brooke if must like can appoint interpreter there be not one of who speaks mug language be know almost same a burmese officer in charge of native levy must be delighted to have one with who must make fellow understand can appoint first class interpreter pay be not very high know might just a well be earning a doing nothing must give sort of official position a son of british officer friend must be one of thank very much captain noton must like immensely must have to get uniform there will be absolute necessity for if get white patrol jacket like white cap cover will establish in eye of native a officer give more authority oh by way need not get for one of lieutenant died other day of fever effect have not be sold yet may a well have patrol jacket belt can settle what be to pay for afterwards will only be matter of few rupee anyhow now arrived at house have be taken for use of officer on entering captain noton introduced to others a several of have at various time met father in cantonment on service be heartily welcomed by at luncheon listened with great interest to account of fighting in cachar with burmese fancy will find more formidable here if come captain noton said bandoola have great reputation be immensely popular with from what say considerable proportion of fellow met up there be assamese levy raised by burmese grant that burmese seem to have done much better must never have conquered people have come across built up great empire if there have not be good fighting stuff in have doubt that will thrash think will do a easily a troop did in north time now passed pleasantly with stanley have after thinking over declined to accept payment for service for must have hindered freedom of action prevented obeying instruction that uncle might send therefore joined a volunteer interpreter be made member of officer mess be specially attached to native levy soon acquiring word of command assisted officer in drilling into something like order early in may burmese division strong crossed naaf established at rutnapullung fourteen mile south of ramoo a soon a captain noton learned that burmese have crossed river sent news of fact to chittagong with request that reinforcement must be at once sent to then moved out with force from ramoo to ascertain strength of enemy burmese be seen upon hill where be constructing stockade small british force advanced against drove off hill following prepared to attack in plain beyond gun however have not come up partly owing to cowardice of elephant driver partly to fact that be found that several of essential part of gun have be left behind without assistance to clear way captain noton felt that must be imprudent to attack so great force therefore fell back to ramoo here be joined by three company of th native infantry bringing up force to close upon thousand of whom about half be sepoys rest native levy have energy be shown by officer in command of chittagong in sending up reinforcement must well have spared now that point of attack by burmese have be made clear captain noton might have taken offensive in case serious disaster must have be avoided burmese must have be driven back across naaf none however came on morning of th of may enemy appeared on hill east of ramoo being separated from british force by river of same name there be difference of opinion among officer a to whether must be better to maintain position outside town to retreat at once belief that reinforcement might arrive at hour caused captain noton to determine to keep in open so to cover town a long a possible on evening of th burmese came down to river a if to cross retired when two six pounder gun opened fire upon two small gun must produce such effect confirmed british officer in opinion that burmese although might defend stockade well be of little use in open next morning however enemy effected passage of river farther away then advancing took possession of large tank surrounded by high embankment captain noton placed force in enclosure with bank three foot high right flank be protected by river small tank sixty pace in front be occupied by strong picket on left somewhat to rear be tank at native levy be placed main position be held by sepoys with two six pounder a burmese advanced sharp fire be opened upon availed of irregularity of ground of cover of kind threw up shelter bank with such rapidity that fire be by mean so effective a have be expected during day news came that left wing of rd native infantry have left chittagong on th a must arrive next day captain noton determined to hold ground though burmese continued to press forward good many men a well a two three officer have be wounded by fire at consultation be held reinforcement be expected in morning although native levy have shown sign of insubordination evidently must not be relied upon to make stand if burmese attacked in earnest be resolved to retain position during night burmese pushed forward trench heavy fire be maintained on side during day be with considerable difficulty that officer in command of levy kept men from bolting thing look very black captain pringle said to stanley when firing died away at nightfall reinforcement must have be here today be scandalous that must not have be pushed forward at once when asked for still more so that when once started must not have come on with greatest possible speed doubt whether will be able to hold cowardly cur together till tomorrow if bolt sepoys will be sure to do so too in fact position must be altogether untenable for burmese must march round flank take in rear wish to heaven have two three company of white troop to cover retreat there must be fear of sepoys yielding to panic if have british troop with when be outnumbered a be now one can hardly blame if lose heart when enemy be ten time strength will be twenty to one against if fellow here bolt next morning burmese have pushed up trench to within twelve pace of british line tremendous fire be opened at nine o ' clock in spite of effort of officer to keep steady native levy bolted officer with dashed across intervening ground towards main body one of fell dead two others be wounded stanley be running when fell headlong without moment thought consciousness burmese occupied tank a soon a levy have abandoned fire at once took defender of main position in flank retreat be now necessary sepoys drew off in good order a exulting burmans pressed hotly upon cavalry cut off killed man who fell wounded from rank became seized with panic in vain officer exhorted to keep steady reaching rivulet men threw down rifle accoutrement a crossed took to headlong flight little group of officer gathered together fought to end captain noton truman pringle lieutenant grigg ensign bennet maismore doctor be killed three officer only made escape of two be wounded fugitive native sepoys continued flight when two three day later straggled into chittagong be found that total loss in killed missing amounted to about two hundred fifty taken prisoner numbered only about twenty be more le severely wounded for quarter have be given have in pursuit be passed over a dead when after be over be found to be alive be spared from feeling of humanity that might be sent to ava a proof of victory obtained over british number actually found alive be greater only be spared that be capable of travelling among be stanley brooke have remained insensible until pursuit have be discontinued violent kick roused to consciousness sitting up found that dozen burmese be standing round first action on recovering sens be to discover where be wounded seeing sign of blood on white clothes took off cap passed hand over head found that blood be flowing from wound just on top where bullet have cut away hair scalp made wound nearly three inch long at bottom of must feel bone looking up at burmese said in own language be pretty close shave be two three of laughed looked amused two of then helped to foot group among whom there be officer then took distance to rear where be ordered to sit down with three wounded sepoys who have be brought in chapter prisoner little group of prisoner received several addition until number mounted up to twenty spot where be placed be close to bank of river a be suffering severely from thirst stanley asked obtained permission from guard to fetch water first knelt down took long drink then bathed head soaking handkerchief with water made into pad placed on wound put cap on over then filled flask that carried joined companion be permitted to go down one by one to river to drink bathe wound stanley have already learned from knew of what have happened after have be stunned by bullet two of have crossed rivulet before being wounded said that believed white officer have be killed that thought most of troop have got away be more than deserved stanley said indignantly say much about mug have very little drill discipline naturally be afraid of burmese who have long be master if sepoys have kept together under officer might have escaped for burmese must never have be able to break rank of officer have be killed most of wounded before retreat began sahib one of sepoys said apologetically be ten to one against yes know that who have fought before must have known well enough that a long a kept together must have beaten off must have be glad enough to have given up pursuit at last doubt wanted to have share in plunder of ramoo what do think that be going to do with sahib from what said a brought here think that will be sent to ava amarapura lie close together court be sometimes at one place sometimes at other what will do with when get there know may cut off head may put in prison anyhow may be sure that will not have pleasant time of have to hope for be that capture of rangoon by fleet may lower pride bring to treat for term sailed nearly six week ago from calcutta be to have be joined by one from madras allowing for delay ought to have be at rangoon fortnight since must certainly capture place without difficulty so possibly by time reach ava will find peace have be made still burmese may not consider loss of rangoon to be important may even try to recapture may be sure wo do for heard at chittagong that there be twenty thousand troop coming must be quite enough if there be good road plenty of transport for to march through burma from end to end in evening food be brought to prisoner talking with of burmese who came up to look at stanley learned that bandoola have not accompanied force across naaf that be commanded by rajah who ruled four province of aracan upon following morning prisoner be marched away under strong guard six day later reached camp of bandoola be drawn up at distance from great man tent came down accompanied by party of officer to look at beckoned to stanley stanley be brought before bandoola burmese general ask if be officer said to interpreter standing by side man put question in hindustani stanley replied in burmese be officer lordship temporary one only served in mug levy be appointed for knowledge of tongue how be that come to speak language bandoola asked in surprise be trader lordship when trade be put end to by outbreak of war entered army to serve until peace be made learned language from servant in service of uncle whose assistant be burmese general be capable of act of great cruelty when considered necessary at other time be kindly good natured be lad said to one of officer seems bold young fellow must be useful a interpreter to for will want to question countryman when make prisoner however must send with others to ava a be only officer that have taken will send message to of friend at court asking to represent that consider will be useful to praying that may be kept for time treated well may be forwarded to again when make next move against english following day prisoner started under escort of twenty soldier commanded by officer of rank who be specially charged to take safely to ava be fortnight march to irrawaddy until neared river country be very thinly populated when approached bank village be comparatively thick standing for most part in clearing in great forest on march burmese officer frequently talked with stanley asked many question about england india be evidently surprised somewhat sceptical a to account lad gave of fighting strength of country treated with considerable indulgence sent dish from own table when not talking with stanley marched at head of little party of prisoner of whom be sepoys quarter having be given to native levy of evening stanley endeavoured to keep up sepoys spirit by telling probably by time british expedition have arrived at rangoon captured that peace must most likely follow might be exchanged for burmese who fell into hand of english when reached village on bank of river population on seeing came round must have maltreated have not officer interfered said have bandoola order to carry safely to court that anyone interfering with must be severely punished head man of village bent low on hearing general name ask pardon lord prisoner will not be touched have heard news have heard news officer said arrived here yesterday lord barbarian have have audacity to sail up with great fleet of ship to rangoon have vessel of war with though fort fired upon have so many cannon that must not resist have captured town happened fortnight since officer stood thunderstruck at what appeared to to be act of audacious insolence however after moment pause said wrathfully be of little matter town be weak in position for defence force will soon go down to sweep barbarian away now get ready war galley a soon a possible village on river be compelled by law to furnish war galley for king service whenever might be required carried from fifty to hundred men three hundred of boat be always available for service constituted one of strongest division of fighting force of burman empire village be large one in hour crew of galley be on board rowing forty oar started up river what think of news officer said beckoning to stanley to take place in front of men must be mad to tempt anger of lord of golden stool mighty emperor have heard aught of heard vague rumour that fleet have be collected heard nothing for certain a to destination be madness officer repeated will sweep into sea how many of be there do think a to that can say little lord only heard report that ship troop be to sail from madras from calcutta of number of men ship know nothing for certain have taken evil council officer said gravely have heard that gained slight advantage in cachar there have irregular troop to meet largely assamese who be poor coward little success must have turned head will now have regular force to deal with will number hundred thousand twice a many if necessary think that handful must be transported in ship can stand against host there may be more than think lord many of ship will be very big much bigger than trade with rangoon of will carry a many a five hundred men even so officer said scornfully if there be twenty five such ship even fifty force must be a nothing to will have to take to vessel a soon a army approach may be so sir think that will scarce go without fighting must represent to that although much fewer in number than army attacked at ramoo troop made stout fight of that fought steadily until mug ran away after from what hear admit that fled shamefully troop come to rangoon will be better than be for there will be white regiment among though may a say be overpowered with number destroyed think that will see running away think that will really venture to withstand think that will endeavour to do so why there will scarce be occasion for fighting officer said disdainfully be mad to come be madder still to come now rainy season be just at hand in week will be upon river will spread flat country will be marsh even who be accustomed to suffer in place like rangoon fever disease will sweep away when dry season come troop assemble to fight there will be none left will die off like fly will scarce capture enough to send a prisoner to emperor stanley felt that in respect burman prophecy be too likely to be fulfilled knew how deadly be swamp fever to white men in spite of comfortable home on board dhow boat have suffered although during wet season uncle made point of sailing along coast of ascending only river flowed between high bank through country free from swamp remembered that uncle have spoken very strongly of folly of expedition being timed to arrive on coast of burma at beginning of wet season have said that must suffer terribly from fever before must advance up country unless be intended to confine operation to coast town until dry season set in must indeed have be impossible to have chosen worse time for expedition doubtless government of india thought chiefly of necessity for forcing burmese to stand on defensive of so preventing invasion of india by vast army unquestionably too believed that occupation of rangoon stoppage of trade must show court of ava that have embarked in struggle with contemptible foe must be glad to abate pretension to agree to fair term of peace bengal force have be embarked consisted of two british regiment th th battalion of native infantry two battery of european artillery amounting in to men madras force of one division be sent on at once other be to follow shortly consisted of st th regiment madras european regiment seven battalion of native infantry four battery of artillery amounting to men making total of fighting men of whom nearly five thousand be european in addition to transport bengal

arrived on th at mouth of irrawaddy force be detached for capture of island of chuduba negrais on th fleet entered river anchored within bar on following morning proceeded with flood tide up to rangoon liffey larne leading way few shot be fired a went up river burmese be taken wholly by surprise idea that english must venture to invade never having entered mind there be considerable disappointment on board fleet when rangoon came into sight be situated on north bank of main branch of river thirty mile from sea extended about nine hundred yard along bank be six seven hundred yard wide at broadest part beyond town be suburb outside palisade inclosed palisade be ten twelve foot high strengthened by embankment of earth thrown up against on inner side one face of defence ran along river bank while others be protected by willow creek communicating with river town consisted for most part of miserable dirty hovel of few official building of larger size at twelve o'clock liffey anchored abreast of principal battery close to water gate transport being ranged in line in rear of proclamation have be sent on shore on previous day giving assurance of protection to people at large to who must offer resistance when gun of fleet be loaded pause ensued town be evidently incapable of offering resistance be hoped that must capitulate burmese be seen standing at gun also remained inactive apparently paralysed at appearance of great fleet of vessel of size hitherto undreamt of by threatening gun pointed towards however be at last goaded by order threat of officer to open fire upon ship frigate at once replied with broadside in very few minute gun on shore be silenced burmese fled in confusion from work a soon a did so signal for disembarkation be made troop crowded into boat rowed for shore soldier entered town without resistance found completely deserted whole of population have be driven out by governor on previous day according to burmese custom men have be formed into levy while woman child be held under guard a hostage for husband father life being forfeited in case of desertion cowardice by male relation foreigner in town have be seized be few in number consisting of eight ten british trader american missionary after being fettered be taken to custom house prison be brought up tried early on morning of attack be accused of having arranged assault on town naturally urged that if have have least knowledge that be going to be made must have left place in time burmese at once condemned to death be taken back to prison to be executed sentence be not carried out burmese have intended to execute on wall in sight of countryman authority have assembled at prison for purpose when fortunately shot from first broadside fired passed through building causing instant stampede chief at once left city prisoner heavily chained be marched distance into country party of british troop be however pushed forward in advance of town a soon a be occupied guard in alarm for own safety placed prisoner in house made off patrol found there on following morning brought into town great pagoda standing two mile half from town be at once occupied a advanced position by british stood upon conical hill rising seventy five foot above plain area on top be somewhat over two acre in centre rose pagoda three hundred thirty eight foot high boat on river be found to have be removed in spite of proclamation promising good treatment none of inhabitant returned to town being prevented from doing so by burmese authority troop store have be found till end of wet season army have to depend entirely upon fleet for provision remained cooped up in wretched unhealthy town suffering severely from fever malaria boat in stanley other prisoner be conveyed be changed at village going up river a officer be carrying despatch from bandoola to court flag be hoisted a boat came in sight of village be signal that be required within two three minute of arrival prisoner guard officer be on way again thus proceeded night day in four day arrived at ava leaving prisoner in charge of guard officer at once proceeded to palace in hour gun be fired drum beat bell of pagoda rung to give notice to population that great victory have be won over english army annihilated by bandoola valiant troop obliterated impression produced by news have arrived few day previously of landing at rangoon there be great rejoicing among population officer from palace presently came down to boat prisoner be marched through street to jail amid jeer of mob stanley be surprised at meanness of town great majority of house being built of bamboo thatched with grass having very poor appearance public building house of great officer be constructed of plank tiled be heavy tasteless be only upon innumerable pagoda in around town that care seemed to have be bestowed have wondered much at numerous pagoda that have seen near town village a passed up officer have informed that be private property that be considered most meritorious of action to erect one consequently man who have mean to do so built pagoda large small in proportion to sum that must bestow upon on stanley remarking upon great number be in ruin officer replied that be considered so much more meritorious action to build pagoda than to repair one after death of founder be generally suffered to fall into decay for day prisoner be taken out day marched about town for time so a to afford population ocular proof of victory gained by bandoola place in be confined be small filthy at end of week stanley be taken out placed in room by here officer who have have charge of paid visit hour two later have expressed to court said wish of general have have permission accorded for to receive different treatment from others partly because be officer principally because general think that may be made useful to have informed officer of prison that be to be at liberty to walk about in city when please to protect from violence officer two soldier be to accompany so long a may think precaution necessary have ordered dress of fashion to be brought to a otherwise must not go into street without being mobbed stanley expressed gratitude to officer for obtaining indulgence latter replied acted upon order of general have be pleasure to for see that be young man of merit have learned much from about people during journey have seen foolish a have be to undertake to match against there be yet thing might be learned from that if have remained in island many month journey away from here might have be worthy of friendship short time after officer have left soldier brought up food of very much better nature than with stanley have be hitherto supplied hour later dress arrived be that of burmese officer of inferior grade consisted of tunic of thick cloth coming down to knee leathern sword belt sort of tippet resembling that of english coachman with three layer of cloth thickly quilted leathern helmet going up to point in centre with flap to protect neck ear with be worn tight fitting stocking of cloth low shoe presently officer came in be ordered to go out with once day at hour may desire be relative of officer who brought here have requested to look after safety be much obliged to sir stanley said will be glad indeed to go out to see city kinsman have kindly sent dress if be not to be noticed will be necessary for to stain face hand somewhat have thought of officer said have brought with dye will darken skin must be worse than useless for to dress a burman unless did so for must seem even more singular to people in street that white man must be seen walking about dressed a officer than white prisoner must be taken through street under guard be ready to go out with now if wish will be ready in few minute stanley replied on being left alone at once changed attire stained face hand have just finished when officer returned smiled said there be fear of being suspected now might really go about safely without guard unless be to enter into conversation with anyone speak language very well accent be not quite same a ours here though in aracan must pas unremarked a went out from prison officer told two soldier who be waiting there to follow at distance approach said unless call up house be not constructed in continuous row be very scattered house having inclosure garden population be very small in comparison to area occupied by town be divided into two part inner outer town whole be surrounded by brick wall five mile half in circumference sixteen foot high ten foot in thickness strengthened on inside by great bank of earth inner town be inclosed by separate wall with deep ditch on two side river irrawaddy on third tributary river on fourth considerable portion of inclosed area be occupied by royal quarter containing palace court of justice council chamber arsenal house of minister chief official be cut off from rest by strong well built wall twenty foot high outside be stockade of same height total population of ava be officer did not take stanley to royal quarter observing that be better not to go there a although have leave to walk in town might give offence be to show near palace after going through wall visited two three of market of there be eleven in town market consisted of thatched hut shed be well supplied with product of country here be rice maize wheat various other grain stick of sugar cane tobacco cotton indigo mango orange pineapple custard apple plantain be in abundance also peacock jungle fowl pigeon partridge goose duck snipe little meat be on sale a burman religion forbids killing of animal for food venison be only meat allowed to be sold in market there be lizard iguana snake be exposed freely for sale there be large quantity of turtle tortoise egg have be brought up from delta stanley saw that there have really be great occasion for to stain skin a people be for most part lighter in colour than hindoo many of men have however stained face to darker colour be tattooed more le men woman child be smoking frequently when hand be required for purpose thrust cigar into large hole bored in lobe of ear men woman be somewhat short in stature squarely built muscular in majority of case inclined to be fat men wore sort of kilt consisting of double piece of cloth wrapped round body falling to knee over be loose tunic with sleeve open in front headdress be scanty white turban dress of woman be somewhat similar to of hindoo consisting of single garment like sheet wrapped round body fastening under arm falling to ankle of upper class be more elaborate rank among woman be distinguished so stanley guide pointed out to by manner in hair be plaited twisted by ornament in men like woman wore hair long while men wore theirs in knot at top of head woman gathered in at back face be broad at cheekbone narrowed in sharply at forehead chin narrow oblique eye showed relationship between burmese chinese neighbour seemed to stanley light hearted merry people going about business with much chatter laughter sound of musical instrument must often be heard inside house several men in bright yellow garment mingled with crowd in market be priest officer told must be mortal act of sacrilege be anyone else to wear that colour stanley remarked upon seeing so few soldier officer told that there be regular army in burma man capable of carrying arm be obliged to serve in case of war with exception of king bodyguard very small body of men who be police rather than soldier there be force permanently kept up man be expected to know something of military duty be able to build stockade from fact that flesh of wild fowl formed one of principal article of food peasantry throughout country be accustomed to use of gun be fair marksman be officer stanley said at present yes tomorrow may return to land be same with highest minister one day may be trader if recommended to king a one possessing ability straightway be chosen to be high official if doe not please king fails in duty then next day may be selling in bazaar again everything be at will of king nobody be born with fortune rank for everything belongs to king at man death go back to thus everyone in land have equal chance in war bravest becomes general in peace cleverest be chosen a councillor walking about stanley soon found that there be great variety of dialect talked in street that language of burmese of coast of native of pegu central province of from district bordering on shan state frontier of china differed a widely a of most remote part of great britain did from other being so be convinced that there must be difficulty whatever in passing a native without attracting observation inquiry so far a language went feature still more shape of face might however be noticed by first comer in daytime thought indeed that little tinge of colour in corner of eye so a to lengthen appearance give oblique cast to must make difference general shape of head be unalterable burmese nose mouth did not differ very greatly from european except that nostril be smaller in shape be round rather than oval for three week continued same life then burmese officer with whom have now become very friendly said when entered one morning must not go out today there be news that people have made two forward march first be against stockade took killed many of men other time marched out four five mile have fight with troop again killed many thing have angered king people of course be nothing for troop be only beginning to assemble be considered insolent in extreme king face be darkened against countryman four of prisoner have be taken out morning publicly executed if news of defeat come fear that will be very dangerous even for have best do friend must fain save for have come to know other see that there be much good in way though differ greatly from ours be to take out a usual might be killed in street be to slip away escape must assuredly be put to death if in way can help must fain do so relation who brought up here left fortnight since to rejoin bandoola so influence can not serve say that might not escape from prison since be not like others confined in dungeon see not what must do where must go be to disappear order must be sent down river to village passing craft must be examined must be sure to be detected while must be well nigh impossible to travel country on foot for be thinly inhabited there be often very long distance between village much of country be swamp forest without path for village trade go by river have little communication with other know that from what say think that troop will beat ours even when assemble in large number be so fear that there must be little chance of life being spared be not for must say that bandoola having recommended must be in danger here have better remain until peace be made what think be very difficult to reply at once stanley said thank greatly for offer to befriend in way can say have not thought of escape for have of course done so seemed to thing in distance at rate until rain be over river have sunk must be useless to attempt see now that will be safest for to try without delay if will come in again afternoon will tell have thought of will do so will try to think how best matter can be managed must remember that great thing be for to find concealment for present after search for have be made for time will die away will then be easiest plan for to make way down river chapter ruined temple after officer left stanley sat thinking for long time inclined strongly towards river saw that at present difficulty must be very great war boat be passing up down body of troop be being carried down in large craft in village men knew be assembling drilling even in ava must see difference in population proportion of men to woman having markedly decreased since arrival a to journey by land appeared to impossible be too altogether without money whether by water land must be necessary to go into village to buy provision indeed money must have be almost useless for there be coined money in burma payment being made in lead for small amount in silver for large one quantity necessary being cut off from small stick bar paid in filing seemed to that best thing must be to take to forest for time endeavour to subsist upon wild fruit if be not to be found there to go out into field orchard at night so manage to hold on for few week friend told that in forest along principal line of route to capital be many bad character person who have committed crime fled from justice be cultivator who having be unable to pay tax have deserted land taken to wood committed depredation trader coming into town from shan state from country where ruby emerald be found always travelled in caravan for mutual protection at time levy be called out many of marauder be killed stanley then have hit upon nothing definite when officer returned in afternoon in reply to latter question acknowledged at once that only thing must see be to take to forest until active search for have ceased must find difficult to maintain have thought of better way than be acquainted with phongee who life in temple in lonely spot four mile away be good man though somewhat strange in habit feel sure that on recommendation must take in there must be little chance of being discovered there must not go dressed a be must disguise a peasant though might be well to retain present attire may be useful to afterwards fear that will fare badly with in way of food there will be enough to eat will be of simplest so that there be enough to keep life together matter little what be then be settled now about making escape from here door be closely barred at night there be window save four little hole high up in wall scarce bird must get through must cut through thatch above stanley said if have something must stand upon to do so there be bamboo lying just at bottom of step with cord might make sort of ladder must then be able to get at thatch will bring cord tomorrow for to let down to ground then will arrange where to meet will guide out of town take to priest will bring disguise for stain for body arm for a peasant must be naked to waist can think of nothing better thank most heartily stanley said trust that may get into trouble for kindness that have shown there be fear of friend one will know have be away from town be greatly afraid that will be will be able to do for for be told that be to go down river with next batch of troop will start in three day have only be informed of since saw morning have not be for must have be glad for be in war time only that one can obtain honour promotion be sorry that be going sir will miss kindness sorely can understand desire to go to front be same with when there be war officer soldier hope that regiment will be sent there however will see again have bandoola army moved yet do think that will do so be long march down to rangoon from ramoo believe that will remain where be until see how matter go at rangoon a soon a people be driven out will be joined by great army will march to dacca there troop from north will join then will go to india think fancy stanley said with smile if wait until be turned out from rangoon stay at ramoo will be long one next day officer brought several yard of strong cloth such a be worn by peasant piece of muslin to make circular band be worn by lower class instead of complete turban lot of horse hair to be worn on top of head now said strip to waist will dye body have dye of two colour here one for skin other to draw line on face so a to make look older with can also imitate tattoo mark on chest shoulder here be long knife such a everyone wear here be cord a soon a be getting dark must carry up two of bamboo pole taking care that one observes do so there be seldom anyone in courtyard have have knife sharpened will cut through thatch easily enough when get away walk straight to market that lie nearest to will be at entrance will take suppose two hour to make ladder get out can not begin until guard close door tell never come in brings last meal hour before sunset generally sit on top of step till come up to lock door be about nine o'clock see again until unbars door in morning must not think that will take a long a two hour to make ladder cut thatch at rate by eleven ought to join suppose gate be open oh yes be never closed though of course must be if enemy be near there be guard anywhere after staining stanley skin officer waited quarter of hour for to dry thoroughly then proceeded to draw line on face across forehead from corner of eye then spent nearly hour in executing rough tattoo mark on body arm dye be very good will last for week before begin to fade will bring with bottle tonight so that can at least re dye skin here be wax must turn hair up from neck plaster in place with turban will prevent anyone seeing how short hair be here be little bottle of black dye with have better colour before fixing with wax stanley hair have not be cut for time before have be captured by burmese in two month have since elapsed have grown very long must therefore be turned up a officer suggested putting on usual garment sat at place at door of cell until guard brought up evening meal having eaten dyed hair hour later turned up plastering with wax tied bit of fibre round where turban must come by time be getting dusk sat at door at top of step until saw that courtyard be deserted guard at gate having gone outside to enjoy coolness of air then ran down step took two bamboo pole about ten foot in length two short piece of same wood thicker than finger hurrying up step with laid down against side of room then went to step again sat there until saw guard coming across to fasten door when went in a soon a heard bar put up began preparation first lashed short piece across end of two bamboo so a to keep foot apart then put ratline across soon have ladder completed made up clothes into bundle wrapped rough cloth round waist adjusted knot of horse hair on top of head fastened there with wax wound turban round below disguise be complete fixing ladder against wall climbed be not long before cut hole through thatch of sufficient size to pas out work have taken longer than have expected for have to be done in absolute darkness however be sure that be well within time fastening end of rope to one of bamboo rafter descended ladder picked up bundle then climbed up again got halfway out of hole listened intently everything be quiet in street in minute stood on ground when turned into principal street there be still many people about sound of music singing came from window for burmese be very fond of music often pas whole night in playing singing there be risk whatever of detection now stepped briskly along until came to open space with row of little thatched hut here paused for minute officer stepped out from behind house joined be not sure at first that be said disguise be excellent have better follow now until get beyond busy street keeping twenty yard behind guide stanley went on until after nearly hour walking passed through gate in city wall now closed up to officer after half hour walk across cultivated country entered forest ground now rose steadily after keeping on for two mile emerged from tree at top of hill space have be cleared of timber be nearly covered with bush young tree in centre be ruin of temple have evidently existed long before burmese dynasty occupied country have be erected by older race be roofless wall have in place fallen ruin be covered with vegetation burman ascended broken step entered temple crossed to one of opposite corner dim light be burning in small apartment have be roofed with thatch man be lying dressed on heap of leaf at one side started up a officer entered who be who come here at hour asked thekyn officer answered be glad to see phongee said may bring here have not fallen into trouble hope in way good priest be starting in two day down river to fight barbarian before go want to do favour phongee smiled beyond naming in prayer thekyn there be little that hermit can do for man not so in case officer said have one here with who need rest concealment must rather that did not ask who be have done crime yet be in danger for month maybe need shelter will give for sake assuredly will priest said father be one of dearest friend in day when dwelt in city must gladly do in power for son be small thing that ask let enter stanley went in priest took down little lamp from shelf on stood held near lad face then turned with smile to thekyn painting be clumsily done said though maybe must pas without close examination be stranger come of race unknown to a said matter not to who be suffice that be friend of yours be welcome to share of shelter food though shelter be rough food somewhat scanty of late few indeed have sought for a hear most of men have gone down to war have brought food officer said for stanley have observed that also carried bundle larger one than own here be supply of rice will last for time with offering will suffice to keep thing going friend be not like bound by religion not to take life know snake be very plentiful round here snake have formed frequent article of diet since have be captured stanley have lost repugnance to that at first felt so prospect of forming staple of food be not disagreeable to must also afford employment to search for kill will be well content said with anything can get trust will be burden upon will assuredly be none priest replied here must be at least thirty pound of rice alone must keep two men alive for month a regard snake though may not kill may eat when killed indeed there be few thing better in truth must not be sorry to have of creature out of way for swarm round here so thickly have to pay great heed when walk lest step upon have be troubled with robber of late father thekyn asked trouble not at priest said men come sometimes may be robber may not ask question sometimes bring fruit other offering know need not fear have nought to lose save life must be indeed evil man who must dare to lift finger against priest one who harm not anyone be ready to share what food have with man who come to hungry well father will say goodbye must be back to city before men be about a must not that absence must be discovered peace be with son may come back safe from war prayer will be said for night morning be in uneasiness a to friend if must ask about companion will reply that be one who have undertaken to rid of of snake who dispute possession of place with thekyn motioned to stanley to come outside hut with when did so handed to small heavy bag be lead said will need when start on journey down country there be eight pound of from what have seen in market will know how much food can be got for small amount of lead must must do more for assist flight have done much indeed very much must regain friend will endeavour to do a much by one of countryman for sake hope that when war be over may meet again hope so burman said warmly can not think that will succeed in getting away son old priest said when stanley returned to cell be going to prayer always rise at hour pray till morning therefore may a well lay down on leaf there be cell like in opposite corner of temple in morning can cut bough roof like make bed there there be room for here will doubtless be more pleasant for to have place to yourself where can go come a like for in day woman come up to consult ask for prayer mind how enter for first time a like a not there will be snake sheltering there stanley lay awake for time listening to monotonous voice of priest a repeated prayer sens soon wandered slept soundly till daybreak first step be to cut stout stick then proceeded to other cell be partially blocked up with stone from fallen roof took two hour to carry stuff out killed no le than nine snake that disturbed in work prospect of sleeping in place so frequented be not pleasant one especially a cell have door to resolved at once to erect sort of bed place where might be beyond reach for purpose cut two pole three four inch longer than cell one end of sharpened drove in between interstice of stone at distance of two foot half apart four foot from ground other end hammered with heavy stone against opposite wall until must go down farther then split up more wood lashed strip almost touching other underneath two pole by aid of strong creeper then filled up bed place between pole with dry leaf one end of bed be inch higher than other be immaterial felt satisfied that even craftiest snake must not reach a to roof be by mean particular about in part of burma rainfall be very small inundation being effect of heavy rain in distant hill country a come down raise level of river in case a much a eighteen foot overflow low lying country before beginning to construct bed have carried snake into phongee after first cutting off head a knew burmans never touch be good indeed son priest said here have breakfast dinner will boil rice fry four of for breakfast bed be half completed when heard priest sound bell be doubtless used a call to prayer however stanley rightly conjectured that in case be summons to meal be soon seated on ground by side of priest little be said at breakfast stanley enjoyed heartily so friend thekyn be starting for war what think of son will easily overpower barbarian have never met in war before doubtless method of fighting be different from ours quite different men be trained a soldier act a one man while burmese fight for then have cannon with can drag about quickly use with great effect although be few in comparison with army going down to attack latter will find very difficult work to turn out of rangoon do think that will beat then that can not say must not be surprised if be to prove so burmese have never be beaten yet priest said have be victorious over enemy burmese be very brave stanley agreed hitherto have only fought against people le warlike than now have to deal with nation have made war study always keep up large army of men who be trained to fight who spend time in military exercise be not that be stronger than burmese for burmese be very strong men only that men who be trained to act together must necessarily posse great advantage over who have have such training who simply take up arm for occasion when trouble be over return to home lay by until called out to fight again besides weapon be better than yours have many cannon by practice can load fire very quickly of when army be near other can fire fifty sixty bullet at once have heard strange story that barbarian have ship without sail with great chimney pours out quantity of black smoke wheel on side a wheel move round vessel can go straight up river against tide even if wind be blowing strongly down be true father there be many such ship only two three have made long voyage across stormy sea to india be wonderful how men can force fire to be servant how can make wheel of ship to move round can not tell father have never seen one of vessel though have heard of priest said more evidently fell into profound meditation stanley getting quietly up returned to work priest came in just a have completed bed be well said looking at approvingly although know that until time have come creature can harm can not resist shudder when hear one rustling amid leaf of bed for come in although of friend have have door placed to exclude entry at night wander little from cell always close door after enter sometimes when be meditating forgetful of earthly matter first know of presence be rustling of leaf in bed at night be a strong in faith a must be must heed not tell so fear be stronger than will be forced to rise turn up leaf with stick until find then open door eject with a much gentleness a may be must get sleep at stanley said think that even door must make feel safer for might forget to shut sometimes tomorrow father will wage war with see if can not decrease number considerably stanley first task be to clear bush away from court of temple after several day hard work carried out although soon saw that by so doing must not diminish number of snake for greater portion of area be covered with block of fallen stone among reptile found impenetrable shelter clearance effected however be so far useful that while creature be before altogether hidden from sight by bush must now be killed when came out to bask in sun on uncovered stone must day destroy dozen more without slightest difficulty ten day after have finished work heard sound of men voice peeping out saw burmese officer with party of eight armed men going to phongee cell be possible that might have come on other business be more probable have come in search of of woman who have come up to hermit have seen at work might have mentioned on return that priest have man at work clearing away bush matter might have come to ear of officer anxious to distinguish idea that be prisoner for whom search be being made occurred to stanley shrank back into cell took up bundle of clothes served a pillow got on to bed standing on be able to get finger on to top of wall hoisted up made way through bough of roof dropped on to ground outside then went round by back of temple until stood outside priest cell must hear voice within without difficulty then know nothing whatever of man nothing replied a have told came to asked for shelter gave such poor assistance a must a must give to anyone who asked have be burden upon for have killed enough snake for food own know not of what part be native not at asked question be business of mine must form idea from speech speech be ours seemed to that be that of native of lower province where be now know not say that at present be away not seeing in front thought have gone out for come go a plea be not hired servant guest cut down bush here in order that might more easily kill snake for indeed be thankful to not only for food that afford because be in such abundance so fearless that often came in here knowing that have naught to fear from then think that will return soon a told not of intention of going out at can not say be away sometimes for hour in forest well in case will watch here until return may be that be idle fellow who prefers killing snake to honest work may also be that be escaped prisoner of whom be in search hear little of what pass in town priest said quietly news must disturb meditation never question who come here to ask for prayer have heard of escape of prisoner be young english officer who got away there have be great stir about house in town have be searched guard boat on river have be warned to allow boat to pas without assuring that be not on board be brown man like clad only in petticoat of rough cloth like other peasant may have dyed skin officer said at rate will stay until return question two of men will take place just inside entrance seize a enters have arm none save knife stick with kill snake may be that have seen coming hither if have committed crime must flee not return here at if doe not come back before be hour when must return to town will leave four men to watch for will wait here if be for week until come back again can do a please priest said only pray withdraw men from neighbourhood of cell must not that meditation be disturbed by talk have come hither for peace quietness to be apart from world distraction will not be disturbed officer said respectfully stanley heard movement of foot then closing of door thinking probable that officer might make search round temple at once made off into wood behind temple a soon a be well among tree exchanged cloth for disguise have worn in town folding up to be used a blanket at night went further into wood sat down proceeded to think what next step have best be be evident that must not return to temple for present be clear also that search for be still maintained that must not be safe to attempt to descend river regretted that have be obliged to leave place without saying goodbye to priest again thanking for shelter that have given be sure that when did not return old man must guess that have caught sight of officer party entering temple have at once fled have not known that guard must remain there must have waited until returned to town must then have gone in seen priest a must remain there for day thought be a well to abandon idea of returning a suspicion that might be man sought for must be heightened by continued absence watch might be continued for long time on chance of coming back concluded that at rate best course must be to endeavour to make way for considerable distance down country then to try get boat knew that country near river be comparatively thickly populated that distance between village be not great so that must find great difficulty in purchasing provision dress have brought with be not altogether unfavourable for such purpose a must easily pas a sub officer whose duty be to inquire whether village have sent able bodied men to war only drawback to must be that if instruction for arrest have be sent down to village along road a well a by river must have probably be directed to specially look for one clad in such attire however must be open to at moment to take to peasant disguise again at last determined to make start by nightfall have traversed several mile through great forest stretching along by side of panlaung river have asked many question of friend officer a went up to temple a to road be told that there be one running almost due south to ramuthayn by must travel down to rangoon by way of tannoo however must take long distance from main river decided that must presently strike road ran about halfway between hill irrawaddy must follow for time must try strike river somewhere between meloun keow uan below point there be network of river few village country be swampy unhealthy infinitely preferred risk of descent by river to by road seemed to that if must obtain possession of one of small native fishing boat must drop down at night unnoticed a width of river at ava be upwards of thousand yard below town often considerably exceeded that breadth when became too dark to proceed further sat down at foot of tree regretted that have mean of lighting fire determined that at risk must obtain mean of doing so at first village that came to for knew that there be tiger leopard in jungle thought however that be not likely to be numerous so near capital old priest have never alluded to a source of danger though indeed have never occurred to to ask in morning continued way have gone mile when heard sudden scream in wood short distance to left feeling sure that be human being in great fear pain drew knife ran at top of speed in direction of cry thinking that might be man woman attacked by robber of forest suddenly came upon small open space twenty yard in diameter hesitated when eye fell on group in centre two men be lying on ground leopard stood with paw on of have gun lying beside fire be burning close by guessed that animal have sprung from tree one of whose bough extended almost a far a centre of opening probably have killed one of men in spring for at moment when saw animal be licking blood from shoulder of man on whom right paw rested other be a far a stanley must see unhurt illustration stanley gave sudden spring buried knife in leopard tread in light burmese shoe have be almost noiseless leopard be keeping up low growling whose back be towards have apparently not noticed hesitated for moment then decided to endeavour to save man who be still alive creeping up stealthily gave sudden spring upon leopard buried knife to hilt in body just behind shoulder with terrible roar rolled over for moment then struggled to foot time have be sufficient for stanley to pick up cock one of gun a leopard turned to spring at aimed between eye fired again beast rolled over stanley caught up other gun thrust muzzle within foot of head fired leopard gave convulsive quiver lay dead chapter with brigand stanley uttered involuntary hurrah a leopard expired at sound burman who have be lying motionless leapt to foot looked at leopard then at rescuer exclaimed in tone of astonishment have slain beast alone with weapon knife stanley replied began fight with knife only caught up one of gun when wounded fired a charged then finished with other comrade burman said have done great deed with courage who be esteemed coward must never even have thought of attacking that great leopard with knife that to save life of stranger saw gun lying on ground have not be for must not have dared to attack leopard for must have be certain death certain death indeed tell first how did seems to well nigh miracle be passing along not far distant when heard cry stanley said thinking that be person in distress ran hither saw lying with leopard forepaw upon beast back be turned to a be growling have not heard approach seeing gun lying there having doubt that be loaded stole up sprang suddenly on leopard drove knife into behind shoulder blow rolled over gave time to pick up gun rest be easy man without word examined body of leopard be a say said be well struck must probably have be fatal animal must have torn in piece before died for gun well comrade have saved life be servant so long a live thought be over with leopard a sprang threw full weight on comrade here have just risen to foot blow struck also to ground raised cry a fell lay there immovable felt leopard paw between shoulder heard angry growling held breath expecting moment to feel teeth in neck have one hope namely that beast must carry off comrade who be well assured be dead to jungle to devour must then come back to fetch managed to breathe once very quietly when felt movement of leopard hearing low sound guessed that be licking comrade blood slightly a moved leopard noticed stood straight up again over dared not breathe again time have come when felt must do so though be sure that must be signal for death then knew not what have happened there be sharp pain a leopard claw contracted then there be loud roar weight be removed from then heard snarl a if about to spring then came sound of gun fall struggle then sound of gun then heard shout knew beast be dead now sir what can do for will first skin leopard care not for skin stanley said must be of use to then with permission will take off keep a long a live a remembrance of narrowest escape that ever have be comrade dead yes man replied leopard struck between shoulder a see force of blow weight of spring must have killed instantaneously then will take sword gun cartridge so stanley undid sword belt buckled round put bandolier of cartridge over shoulder took up gun reloaded while man be at work skinning leopard operation man performed with great speed be evidently one that have done before a soon a beast be flayed rolled up skin placed on shoulder be officer sir asked be fugitive while have be watching man stanley have debated over whether must confide in thought that after service have rendered must do so with safety be englishman be captured by bandoola at ramoo sent prisoner to ava have escaped want to make way down to rangoon heard that order have be sent along river to arrest at present know how to make way down come with man said have friend in forest distance from here will receive gladly when tell what have done for will be safe until choose to go be outlaw at present be master of forest government have hand full there be fear of disturbing stanley thought over matter for minute two doubtless be robber band that be asked to join offer seemed to promise safety for time agree said so that ask to take part in deed of violence about that will do a like man said can tell that make good haul sometimes difficulty be not to capture booty to dispose of have turban for helmet of yours be out of place in wood rest of dress have nothing peculiar about must attract attention have turban have be lately in dress of peasant cloth wore lie fifty yard away dropped a ran will be useful to cover at night if for nothing else stanley exchanged helmet for turban that have before worn fetched cloth will bury companion said must be useless will sleep above ground a well a below if be to reach comrade tonight be time for to be moving at once set out after five hour walking came upon river myitnge tributary fall into irrawaddy at ava be four hundred yard across burman walked along bank for short distance then pulled from clump of bush small boat be just capable of carrying two put in water took seat paddled across to other side where carefully concealed a before be ferry boat said be not often used for headquarters be in great forest will presently come to be a well when occasionally party be sent out to hunt to have mean of crossing to other side two hour walking through cultivated field brought to edge of forest here be a safe a if be in rangoon burman said in hour will reach comrade a rule change headquarters frequently at present there be question of being disturbed so have settled ourselves for time why be comrade on other side of river village lie five mile beyond forest man said at ordinary time dared not venture there thought that at present most of able men must be away so must pay visit to friend asked to accompany a have nothing better to do agreed to go convoy of trader too strong to be attacked have passed down from hill country morning before started there be not much probability that anyone must come again for few day bring down ruby from there do not mine be property of emperor man said gem be sent down once two month under strong guard for many of trader bring ruby down from there of course secretly men who work mine often conceal stone that come upon sell for small sum to trader besides sometimes peasant pick up elsewhere too make haste to sell for anything that can get care for much for be risky business going down to ava to sell trader there knowing at word from must be arrested most likely executed will give next to nothing for prefer silver lead for money garment arm set jewel man take share of what be captured when have enough go home to village pound of silver two three pound of lead be generally quite enough to buy goodwill of head man of village give out that have be working on river in ava since left everyone know better than to ask question in hour reached encampment be now dusk five twenty men be sitting round great fire number of leafy arbour have be constructed in circle beyond what returned so soon one of men said a stanley guide came near enough for firelight to fall on face where be ranji whom have brought here new recruit not exactly parnik one to whom have promised shelter for while ranji be dead must have be dead too eaten have not be for comrade here here be skin of beast who slew ranji when tell that leopard stood with one paw on may guess that escape be narrow one brute be large one one of other men said a meinik for such be name of stanley companion unrolled held skin up see have bullet between eye just behind ear there be knife cut behind shoulder must have be hot work when came to knife with beast of size give food cocoa have eaten nothing today have walked far when have fed will tell story burman recital of adventure with leopard excited great applause admiration from comrade 't be wonderful one said not so much that new comrade must have killed leopard though be great feat that armed only with knife must attack beast like to save life of stranger truly never heard of such thing have sens meinik nodded have received permission from stanley to say who be stanley have consented with reluctance man assured that must trust companion a well a that be much better to tell truth a must soon be seen that feature differed altogether from own that therefore be strange person in disguise be in sens said doe not see thing a do be one of english barbarian who have taken rangoon against whom army be marching be captured at ramoo sent by bandoola a prisoner to ava have made escape will in short time go down river at present search be too hot for so see that be like fugitive what be age one of men asked after silence during gazed at newcomer be lad being a tell between sixteen seventeen see skin be stained face marked so a to give appearance of age if men of race be a brave a be meinik troop will truly have harder work than think to drive into sea doe speak tongue yes stanley answered for have be more than two year in province of chittagong learned from one who be in service must many of people risk life in way did for stranger certainly many men constantly run risk a great to save others one life be man have burman said why must give for stranger think that stop to think of stanley said seems to natural that if see in danger of life must try to save whether be man woman whether be from fire from other fate must be strange people burman said gravely must scarce have credited have not heard that have done be wonderful too lad who have not yet come to full strength must be glad to have such man for comrade friend whether be burman english matter little have risked life for one of be brother a long a like to stay with there be warm exclamation of assent round circle stanley felt that have cause for uneasiness a long a remained with in evening men sang many song at request stanley sang english one choosing with lively air burmese be much pleased surprised at joined merrily in chorus dozen of then set to work with knife cut down sapling bough constructed for stanley arbour similar to others lay down well satisfied with result of adventure feeling that must remain with merry fellow criminal though might be until must be safe to make way down river in morning men started early leaving in charge of fire went off in party of four five to watch various road leading to capital two three of dressed a peasant going to town where traveller must halt so a to gain information a to party coming down when gathered again at dusk one party only have have success have met six merchant coming down with horse laden with spice indigo cotton have offered resistance have taken a much a must carry then allowed to go on with rest of good there be general feeling of regret that party have not be more numerous expression of anger at spy on road by trader have come for not letting know beforehand so that must have placed whole force there carried away good be thing suit best meinik said to stanley see one can go down with parcel of cinnamon pepper bag of dye fifty pound of cotton into town sell in market at fair proper price of course one dress one self a small cultivator there be suspicion that be not right will keep sharp lookout for men a come back again relieve of silver good may have taken in exchange be if come by same road be more likely that after adventure today will choose other take guide travel by village track doubt think that have got off easily for have not lost more than quarter of good be war time now there be fear of force being sent against usually take so much a quarter of merchandise be to lose everything must make complaint then must have force sent up against be obliged to move away for time a be be so pleased with getting greater part of good safe to market that care to make fuss about for might have to pay court official others more than value of good lost often resist then not often if man loses good can gather more again when life have gone everything have gone besides a rule take care that be so strong that see at once resistance must be hopeless sometimes bring armed guard with be men who make business to convoy trader down when time be troubled sometimes have fight with a rule seldom attack unless be so strong that dare to oppose still do have fight sometimes for shan guard be brave fellow convoy be generally rich one for must not pay small trader to hire men to protect in time of peace seldom stop long in one neighbourhood for when once becomes known what road be lying near come along in party too strong to be attacked a matter little to where live move away perhaps hundred mile then settle on line of traffic have not be here long be last down by tannoo did well for long time there until at last governor raised villager hunted wood found that have to leave expect will stay here time now there be fear of troop being sent out can afford not to press too hardly on traveller for have done so well of late that must separate return to home with good store of booty half number did leave when came up from south more of must go if be not for order that everyone will join army be much pleasanter to live here free to do a like than to be driven down like herd of beast to fight besides have quarrel with people be official at aracan who began let fight if like stanley remained fortnight with band at end of time heard that party of thirty trader be coming down together that have with ten armed guard doubt supposed be ample protection for a band generally worked in such small party be believed that there be few outlaw in forest band went out returned in evening laden with spoil two three of be wounded not severely so have resistance today meinik lasted only for minute man said a soon a saw how strong be guard be glad enough to put up sword let bind hand foot while searched merchant a see have made good capture though have not seized more than fifth of what brought down with will take time to pack bale again for searched everything thoroughly made merchant strip searched clothes hair what did do for well be way said to comrade a went along morning englishman be going to leave in day two have not forgotten what owe must like to make present propose that search party thoroughly today from what heard of come from ruby country be pretty sure to have gem concealed about in baggage propose that stone find will give to friend ' agreed at once for a know like ruby a told be of little use to for can not dispose of without great risk so did a proposed have good fortune twelve out of number have gem hidden about of good lot need not hesitate to take for may be sure that bought for next to nothing from poor fellow who have risked life to hide there be have not looked at just emptied parcel into bag a found of course be rough stone must take a present from of a proof that burman even if be robber be grateful for such service a that rendered stanley felt that must not refuse gift so offered even though good be stolen a meinik said gem be of little use to robber since be afraid to try dispose of owner have broken law in having purchased have doubtless given sum bearing proportion to real value therefore thanked meinik very heartily also after have have meal rest of band who made very light of matter thing be useless to said if have be silver even lead must have be different to endeavour to sell ruby have to risk life good that have got that day must fetch far more money than ruby must be sold without difficulty a soon a war be over must go down to village band must break up have enough silver lead hidden away to keep for year even if never did work what do do with when get back hide must never do to enter village with ten twelve pound weight of silver three four time a much lead for headman might take into head to have searched so generally dig hole at foot of tree in quiet spot take perhaps pound of silver two three of lead with gift of half that silver be enough to convince headman that be honest fellow who have be working hard since went away from time to time can go to store get what want from can build house marry take up field two perhaps become headman before very long well be sure wish well stanley said have be very kind to since joined will be glad to think of a settled quietly down in village rather than a remaining here when day other might all be captured harm come to next morning stanley started with meinik who be native of small village on river forty mile below ava who have resolved to accompany down to rangoon will be able to get boat net for pound two of lead if be hailed can do talking can land buy provision if wanted have arranged with comrade to take share of silver lead have stored up at once for be likely that will also have gone to home before will have returned have changed everything into money except what took yesterday before starting stanley be again dyed tattoo mark imitated far more carefully than before three four of men operating upon at once face be almost entirely covered with mark liquid be applied that extracted colour from eyebrow left snow white of hair be similarly treated looking at in pool of water stanley did not in slightest degree recognize felt certain that one must suspect of being young english captive resuming peasant cloth took hearty farewell of band started with meinik latter carried bundle slung on gun contained clothes did not look heavy in centre be two parcel weighed forty pound stanley carried bundle with other clothes several pound of rice two day walking took to meinik village once out of forest travelled at night reached village just a people be astir place consisted of ten twelve hut meinik created quite excitement among few people who inhabited consisted of two three old men woman child where have be for last year half meinik if may ask working near ava said a must have to go to war if have remained there thought must come back see how be have saved little money may settle down whether here elsewhere have not yet made up mind will have to go to war one of old men said there be scarce day that one of war canoe doe not stop here to see if there be able bodied men have taken eight will assuredly take then will get boat said take to fishing war can not last long will do best to keep out of way of war canoe until be over if of have boat to sell will buy will sell mine old man said of son have be taken to war be too old to work be good one son made only last year whom have with stanley have remained short distance off while meinik be talking to friend be old man joined along road said be skilful fisherman have agreed to go with if can get boat be there empty hut yes six of of course when men be taken carried off wife child a usual a hostage for conduct meinik nodded felt surprise a be custom in burma to hold woman child of men going to war a guarantee that husband must not desert show cowardice in battle in event relative must be at once put to death companion be tired said walked night so will cook food will sleep at once took possession of one of empty hut be just a be left by proprietor one of woman brought brand two from hearth earthen cooking pot be filled with water placed above few handful of rice dropped in two three snake cut up into small piece pepper pod be added then meinik went out talked to acquaintance arranged for purchase of boat stanley watched fire in hour meinik returned boat be good one said net in fair order have bought for two pound of lead have promised that when war be over man son return be to be free to to buy back at same price after eating meal lay down slept until late in afternoon then meinik bought earthenware pot flat slab of same material for making fire on pepper capsicum little cinnamon nutmeg basket of mango tobacco a soon a became dusk took place in boat meinik carrying down two three faggot of wood boat be canoe hewn out of pine log must have carried four people comfortably there be plenty of room for to lie down at full length be very light wood having be cut away until be little thicker than cardboard be almost universal method of construction even war canoe must carry sixty paddler sitting two by two on bench thirty soldier being hewn from great single log of teak net be stowed one at end in middle be fireplace on brand of fire have already be laid near be faggot store meinik stanley sat on net with paddle former have hidden greater portion of store of money in ground before entering village a soon a have fairly started stanley said have not better get rid of fire meinik light must draw attention to that matter little burman replied there be not likely to be war canoe about at night expect that most of will have gone down river people fish either by night by day even if war canoe came along must not trouble about for of course many men too old to go to war remain here go on fishing people can not starve because there be fighting old men woman must cultivate field fish people of town must starve many even of young men go keep away from village during day work in field headman shut eye for know that if field be not cultivated people can not pay share of tax still be a well to be on safe side when fire have burnt low will lay cloth over top of boat so that glow of ember will not be seen kept course near middle of river partly because current there be stronger partly because war canoe might be coming up must keep close to one bank other kept on way until there be faint gleam of light in sky then paddled into shore chose spot where bush drooped down into water forcing canoe in behind so a to be entirely concealed from sight of passing boat cooked food having eaten breakfast lay down slept until evening illustration forced canoe behind bush so a to be entirely concealed night after night journey be continued supply of food be ample to last there be therefore occasion to stop at village to purchase more river at point where started be about two mile wide at point be double that width while at others contracted to little over mile level be much lower now than have be when stanley ascended two month before sometimes at night towed one of net behind obtained ample supply of fish for want night made a stanley calculated about forty mile after ten day travel came to point where great river divided one small arm running down to rangoon descending to bassein then falling into sea at cape negrais while large proportion of water found way down by innumerable branch between rangoon bassein river for last two three day have be obliged to observe great caution for below prome there be number of boat going down river laden with men store however only travelled by day canoe be always at time floating in shelter of bush hauled up on bank at spot where must be concealed from view by thick growth of rush will never be able to get down to rangoon by water said river will be crowded with rowboat near town there will be chance whatever of making way through at next village come to will go in learn news countryman may have be driven out by time in case there will be nothing to do to travel north on foot until reach chittagong have fear that will be driven out meinik conversation have occurred on night when have passed point of division of two arm of river have caught larger supply of fish than usual a soon a boat be laid up meinik started along bank with number of for nearest village returned in two hour be well landed said for point where greater portion of people be gathered be henzawaddy only fifteen mile further on be right people have not be driven out large number of troop be down near rangoon in fighting have taken place have gained advantage people marched out at end of may carried stockade advanced to joazoang attacked village defended by stockade carried after having killed hundred of men then great stockade on hill near river three mile from rangoon people thought must not be taken so strongly be protected be attacked gun of people made great gap in stockade mile in front of two hundred men be killed also commander then people marched on to great stockade at kemmendine troop when got there saw how strong be be afraid to attack lay down night close to thought must destroy when attacked in morning ship that have come up with opened fire at daybreak a stockade be hidden from sight of on river have thought that ship must hing shot great ball up into air came down inside stockade where burst with explosion like noise of big gun killed so many that troop must not remain under so terrible fire went away leaving to people to enter stockade without fighting chapter among friend certainly seems to stanley said when heard burman account of state of thing below will not be possible for to go further by water must be very dangerous meinik said be certain that men in part of country have be obliged to go with army even be native have special reason for avoiding being questioned must be liable to be seized executed at once for having disregarded order to join army assuredly can not pas down farther in boat must take to land must say that have best get spear shield join newly arrived party forget that though disguise a native be good enough to mislead anyone passing on road in dusk after sunset must certainly attract attention if travelling with by day forgot have grown so accustomed to seeing that forget to other people face must seem strange a at first did to in forest indeed look to now like one of ourselves be to join band someone must be sure to ask question concerning ere long what then do think have best do from what heard of country from one of comrade who be native of province must be impossible for after crossing river to make way down on opposite side since whole country be swampy cut up by branch of irrawaddy on side there be few obstacle of kind on other hand will find country full of troop going down towards rangoon comrade told that hill that saw to east from forest at ava extended right down into tenasserim be very high must not be traversed for food must be obtained that tiger wild animal other beast abounded said that smaller hill that crossed on way to village called pegu yoma hill of whose swell come down to bank extend way down to sea between irrawaddy sittang river that from stream flowed to one river other therefore if must gain that range must avoid swamp country altogether few mile back passed river coming in from east if follow up a far a there be water will be among hill said that there be mountain at there just rounded hill with many village much cultivated ground so there ought to be difficulty in making way along will be able to gather food in field can go into village purchase for men will be away besides can get spear shield can say that having be away from home on journey when men be ordered to war returned too late to go with rest of villager be making way down to join many others must be doing same story will be likely enough in way can get down till be close to troop round rangoon must then take chance of getting through seems better than other way meinik said there be such river a speak of above sarawa can paddle back tonight hide near town then can go there in morning buy couple of spear shield get more rice other thing have plenty of ammunition for gun may want if meet wild beast think that there will be danger in going in there meinik of course there be absolute occasion for to have spear shield a have gun ought to have shield meinik replied be better to have spear too also for to carry ax everyone carry axe in war time for always erect stockade though very poor man may only have knife everyone who can afford take axe most people have thing for be wanted for cutting firewood for clearing ground for building house for many other thing burman must be poor indeed who doe not own one by mean then get for meinik besides may find useful for ourselves now lay down slept until evening then started up river again keeping close in under shadow of bank two hour before daylight concealed canoe a usual at spot two mile above sarawa meinik started at daybreak returned three hour later with two ax spear shield night turned into river running to east for four night paddled up country be now assuming different character stream be running in valley with rising ground from hundred to hundred fifty foot high on side be narrowing very fast towards morning on fifth day river have become small stream of two three foot deep decided to leave boat a be evident that must be able to go short distance further may a well hide carefully stanley said be certainly not likely that will want again there be never saying at rate there be great trouble in doing cooked meal then started at once so a to do few hour walking before sun became high determined to keep on eastward until reached highest point of dividing ridge between two main river then to follow southward country be now well cultivated have trouble in avoiding small village dotted thickly about a course be following be not one must take if making straight to join army slept for three four hour in heat of day then pushing on found before sunset on what seemed to highest point of divide to right must see flat country stretching towards irrawaddy to left ground be more sharply undulating two mile away be stream of fair size judged to be river run down to pegu afterwards join rangoon river below town stanley thought that hill on stood be five hundred foot above low country have left great part of hill be covered with tree although at point where have made way up hillside be bare went on until entered forest there set to work to chop firewood meinik carried tinderbox soon have fire blazing by side piled great stock of wood know that there be leopard so far south a said at rate will be safer to keep big fire blazing never used to think much about leopard ever since have that great beast foot upon back have have horror of next morning continued journey south going along boldly passing through several village be late for war old man said a went through one of know be meinik replied be away with caravan of trader when order came so instead of going down river have have to journey on foot will be there in time from what have heard there have not be much fighting yet white barbarian be shut up in rangoon have not attacked in earnest will soon do so moreover will soon be starved for country have be swept clear of cattle for twenty mile round village deserted everything laid waste hear that number be laid up with sickness that great number have died wish be younger that too must help to destroy insolent foe who have dared to set foot on sacred soil there be need for haste now travelled by easy stage until by smoke rising from different part of forest knew that be approaching spot where burmese force lay around rangoon indeed must see great pagoda rising above surrounding country have heard at last village through have passed that there have be attack made upon pagoda on st of july on day burmese in great force have moved down in line parallel to road between pagoda town along considerable number of troop be encamped have advanced until within mile of rangoon then have changed front attacked british position near town occupied hill near line opened fire from there with jingals small cannon two british gun firing grape soon silenced gun madras regiment charged hill recaptured entirely upset plan of wongee in command of burmese signal for whole of army to attack be to have be given a soon a left have broken through british line have thus cut off troop on road leading to pagoda from town seeing that movement have failed general did not give signal for general attack ordered troop to fall back have be recalled in disgrace to ava senior officer who arrived just after battle assumed command at once set to work to make very strong stockade at kummeroot five mile from great pagoda also fortified point on river above kemmendine stockade have be captured by british intended from point to send down fire raft to destroy british shipping at same time made continuous attack at night on british line rain at time be falling incessantly burmese did not think that british must be able to move out against position on river be connected with at kummeroot by strong stockade burmese general be convinced that if attack be made must be easily defeated however eight day after repulse of burmese first attack vessel came up river while land column moved against kummeroot position be strong one river be here divided into two branch on point of land between principal stockade be erected be well provided with artillery while on opposite bank of river other stockade with gun be erected so that attack by water must be met by direct fire from great stockade cross fire from on bank four ship came up burmese gun opened upon heavy fire from men of war be not long in silencing then number of boat full of troop have landed stormed stockade driven out burmese land column have be unable to take gun with owing to impossibility of dragging along rain sodden path burmese chief confident in strength of principal post be defended by three line of strong stockade one above in immensely superior force treated with absolute contempt advance of little british column of be informed a soon a started by scout thickly scattered through wood general soomba wongee be just sitting down to dinner when be told that column have nearly reached first stockade directed chief to proceed to post drive audacious stranger away continued meal until heavy rapid musketry of assailant convinced that matter be more serious than have expected a rule burmese general take active part in battle soomba wongee left tent at once went towards point attacked found troop already retreating that two outer stockade have be carried by enemy rallied men led way to attack steady continuous fire of british rendered impossible for to restore order burmese remained crowded together in hopeless confusion however managed to gather together body of officer troop with charged desperately upon british soldier with several other leader of rank be killed burmese be scattered through jungle leaving eight hundred dead behind fact that ten stockade provided with thirty piece of artillery must have be captured in one day by british have created deep impression among villager of neighbourhood from whom truth must not be concealed indeed village for many mile round scene of action be crowded with wounded told meinik that army be for time profoundly depressed many have deserted fact stockade have thought impregnable be of avail against enemy whose regular combined action be irresistible a against own isolated individual method of fighting have shaken hitherto profound belief in own superiority to people with whom might come in contact since time serious fighting have taken place occasional night attack have be made effort on part of invader to obtain food by foraging party have proved unsuccessful boat of fleet have gone up puzendown river joined rangoon river distance below town have captured large number of boat have be lying there waiting until rangoon be taken before going up river with cargo of rice salt fish have gained no other advantage for although village be crowded with fugitive from town be driven into jungle by troop stationed there for purpose a soon a boat be seen coming up river in case however boat have arrived so suddenly that there have not be time to do fugitive have be taken to rangoon where be said have be very well treated great reinforcement have now come down from upper province two of king brother have arrived to take command of army one have established at other at pegu have brought with number of astrologer to fix upon propitious time for attack king invulnerables several thousand strong special corp whom shot steel must injure be with about th of august strong position have be taken up by force sent by prince at pegu in old portuguese fort of syriam have be attacked with order that channel of rangoon river must be blocked so that none of stranger must escape fate awaited position be very strong one tree brushwood round fort have be cleared away wherever there be gap in old wall stockade have be erected great beam suspended from parapet in order that if attack be made rope must be cut beam fall upon head of assailant british have however thrown bridge across deep creek pushed on against place carried in few minute garrison flying a soon a assailant gained rampart to pagoda standing on very steep hill defended by gun assailable only by very steep flight of step troop however pressed up fearlessly garrison discouraged shaken by report of fugitive from lower fort have fled a soon a british arrived at top of step notwithstanding other a successful attack upon stockade burmese troop now felt confident that with numerous force must be victorious whenever astrologer decided that favourable moment have arrived meinik have ascertained from villager name of leader locality to corp belonged be posted nearest to rangoon a soon a be dark stanley entered forest smoke have served a guide to a to position of different corp be able to make way between without being questioned presently however came upon strong picket where be going officer in command asked to join corp of woondock snodee meinik replied be away at bhanno when order came rest have gone down river before got to mew so came on by not wishing to fail in duty be just in time officer said woondock be quarter of mile away on left moved off in direction soon left track avoiding camp kept away until reached edge of forest then crept forward through jungle brushwood pausing to listen from time to time three time changing course to avoid party of burmese acting a outpost on issuing from jungle crawled forward for three four hundred yard so a to be beyond musket shot of outpost then remained quiet until morning broke then must perceive red coat moving about in small village before breastwork have be thrown up four hundred yard away from getting up to foot ran towards several shot be fired at from jungle behind soldier at once appeared at breastwork supposing that two figure approaching be burmese deserter did not fire stanley companion be soon among be soldier of one of bengal regiment stanley to surprise addressed in own language be englishman said be one of prisoner

cordially with stanley who be companion major asked be englishman also sir be native be most faithful fellow have acted a guide way down from point started from twenty mile from ava must never have accomplished without aid for although speak burmese well enough to pas anywhere face be so different in shape from theirs that if be looked at closely in daylight must be suspected at once must never have got here without aid how be that came to help sir major pemberton asked a far a can see burmese hate like poison even when be wounded to death will take last shot at soldier marching past happened to save life from leopard stanley said truly have shown gratitude jemadar major said take man away with see that be well treated give food of course will presently go with officer to general stanley said few word in burmese to meinik telling that be to have food must afterwards go with to general then at invitation of officer sat down with to breakfast while eating stanley told something of adventure after meal be over major said have better go with mr brooke to general captain cooke can not well leave regiment can let have outfit mr brooke though be most of reduced pretty well to last garment what with jungle what with damp have nearly arrived at last state of dilapidation be sure general must like to see in present disguise make difference to sir stanley said with laugh be so accustomed to black petticoat now must almost feel strange in anything else be afraid dye will be long time before wear out be nearly three week since be dyed last have faded very little yet need not take arm anyhow captain cooke said will attract le attention going without for will only be supposed that be one of native who have be brought in by boat meinik be sitting on ground contentedly outside cottage jemadar standing beside have have food meinik stanley asked man nodded good food said that be right now come along with can leave weapon here wo be wanted meinik rose followed stanley captain cooke there be house scattered along roadside be now occupied by officer troop there be so many of that have not be necessary to place of men under canvas important consideration during almost continuous rain of last three month why cooke did not know that talked burmese officer standing at one of door remarked a officer came along chatting with stanley know accomplishment phillipson captain laughed for idea that there existed thing a burmese peasant who must talk english have not occurred to other be taking to chief to show off power passed on leaving officer looking after with puzzled expression on face on arrival at sir archibald campbell headquarters captain cooke sent in name a general be not at moment engaged be at once shown in followed by stanley meinik remaining without good morning sir see have brought in deserter general said be not deserter sir be escaped prisoner who have made way down from ava through enemy line be mr brooke be serving a officer with native levy at ramoo be reported a killed however be fortunately only stunned being only officer found alive be sent by bandoola a prisoner to ava may say that be son of late captain brooke of th native infantry be certainly wonderfully disguised general said congratulate heartily on escape must have passed by a native without second glance though now that be told that be englishman can see that have not wide cheekbone flat face of burman how did manage to make way down travelled almost entirely by night sir have with faithful guide be outside think must ever have got down without though speak burmese well enough to pas especially a language differs so much in different district be burman yes general have arranged with for particular sum for service if so will of course be paid sir came down simply in gratitude for service rendered know whether intends to go back hope that will remain here with have brought mr brooke here sir captain cooke said at request of major thinking that might like to ask question a to state of thing in interior must like to have long talk with mr brooke general said unless have certain news of date intend to attack will not detain now first thing will be for to get into civilized clothes again by way poor young hitchcock effect be to be sold morning must think that must fit mr brooke very well let see of course pay have be running on since be taken prisoner mr brooke be afraid sir that there be pay due stanley said happened to be at ramoo at time looking after good of uncle who carry on considerable trade on coast a talk language there be very few who did so volunteered to act a officer with native levy preferred to act a volunteer in order might be free to leave at time if received order from uncle to join at chittagong must give order on know where be to be found have with uncut ruby though have idea what be worth for have not even looked at yet must certainly be good security for pound can settle presently mr brooke will write order on paymaster for rupee can talk matter over afterwards be afraid that will have to pay rather high for clothes for almost everyone here have worn out kit mr hitchcock only joined fortnight before death so that be in very good condition of course be uniform be on staff will not matter must hardly be going about in civilian clothes here will be very glad if will dine with at six o'clock evening have talk with man before see what want to do if be sharp fellow might be very useful to general wrote order on paymaster captain cooke took stanley across to office obtained cash for making inquiry found that sale be to come off in quarter of hour will do bidding for if like brooke captain cooke said dare say must rather not be introduced generally in present rig much rather not will be much obliged by doing right will make money go a far a can of course poor fellow brought full dress uniform with anything of sort will find here with burman stanley said will stroll round place for hour then come back here again there be very little to see in town meinik be astonished when mounted river bank have view of ship lying at anchor for time be too surprised to speak never having seen anything larger than clumsy cargo boat made voyage once year up river be wonderful said at last who must have thought of such great ship if emperor must see think that must make peace be easy to see that know many thing more than do must one go on board of not a be at present meinik when get english clothes on again rid from of stain have doubt will be able to take on board one of ship of war now will let know what be thinking of doing told general what service have rendered asked what be going to do told that a yet did not know whether be going to stay here go back again be going to stay here think so at rate for time know where uncle have told about be at present at rate while war be going on can do very little trade can manage very well without a long a stay here will stay burman said if went back must have to fight against people want to do have quarrel with from what see be not so sure a be that will drive into sea have beaten whenever have fought must rather stay with than be obliged to fight against not many men want to fight heard that in village that who have not got wife child held a hostage for get away from army hide in wood will be great man now if will let stop will be servant will gladly keep with meinik if be willing to stay be sure that will be better off here than out in wood good deal safer at rate stay until after people make next attack will see then how useless be for to fight against when can attack in stockade although be ten to one against drive out after quarter of hour fighting may be sure that in open ground without defence will have chance hope will soon get tired of fighting that court will make peace did not want to fight with be who attacked now that have have expense of coming here will go on fighting till emperor agrees to make peace think that will ever go out of rangoon again believe that will also hold port in tenasserim that have captured emperor will never agree to meinik said shaking head positively then if doe not will see that will go up river to ava in end if go on fighting will capture whole country rule over just a have done greater part of india think must be good for man said philosophically must not matter much to to whom paid tax must not tax more heavily than be now for a came down saw many village deserted land uncultivated because people must not pay heavy exaction be not king doe not get much of give province district dozen village to someone at court say 'you must pay so much that can get out of besides be for ' so heap on tax people be always in great poverty when find that can not pay what be demanded live then go away to other place where lord be not so harsh be sure that must be good thing for meinik people of india be great deal better off under than be under native ruler there be fixed tax one be allowed to charge more to oppress people in way now must be going said must be back at place started from in hour chapter on staff captain cooke have done best previous to beginning of auction to disarm opposition by going about among officer who dropped in with intention of bidding telling something of stanley capture adventure escape saying that general have advised to obtain outfit by buying considerable portion of young officer kit have doubt that will put on staff said from knowledge of country fact that speaks language well must be very useful a have gone through from serving a volunteer without pay hope fellow wo run up price except for thing really want story have desired effect when captain cooke met stanley be able to tell that have bought for greater portion of kit including everything be absolutely necessary be there plain clothes stanley asked after thanking warmly for trouble have taken no of course left everything of sort at calcutta one in sens must think of bringing mufti out with especially to country a then will have to go in uniform to general stanley said in tone of consternation seems to that must be awfully impudent thing to go in staff uniform to dine with general when have right whatever to wear well a general advised to buy thing can not blame for wearing have not least doubt that be going to offer staff appointment of sort must like very much a long a war lasted captain cooke think must care about staying in army permanently see uncle be working up very good business have be at now seven eight year be saying last time be with that a soon a trouble be over trade began again must give fourth share of make third share when got to twenty one then must be great fool to give up captain cooke said heartily man who have got good business out here must have income a much a officer of regiment together be own master can retire when like enjoy money in england still a trade be at standstill at present think that must be wise of to accept offer that general might make to might even be to advantage afterwards to have served on campbell staff will be introduction to officer mess in country may be sure that not only will hold rangoon in future there will be good many more british station between assam here than there now be must be pull for even in way of trade to stand on good footing everywhere quite see that stanley agreed if general be good enough to offer appointment will certainly take have almost right to one brooke in peninsula lot of men got commission by serving for time a volunteer having be wounded at ramoo being one of few survivor of fight having gone through captivity at small risk of being put to death first time that king be out of temper claim be very strong one indeed besides there be hardly man here who speaks burmese service will be very valuable here be fifty rupee went on handing money to stanley be not much change out of five hundred can assure that have got thing at bargain for must have have to pay more than for in england fancy most of thing be in very good condition for hitchcock only came out about four month ago of course clothes be nothing like new at rate be in very much better state than of anyone who came here three month ago have ordered to be sent to quarter where of course will take up abode till something be settled about will probably be evening in case will have quarter allotted to tomorrow thank very much will devote best portion of afternoon to trying to get rid of a much of stain a can at least off face hand rest doe not matter one way other will wear off gradually must like to get face decent well be rather object stanley said must not matter so much about colour tattoo mark be to say least of singular of course look so rum now in native undress when get uniform on effect will be startling will have chat with doctor may have something in medicine chest will at least soften down bit of course if be real tattoo mark there must be nothing for a be only dye paint of sort must wear out before very long will try anything that will give care if take skin off on returning to quarter of captain cooke stanley be introduced to other officer of regiment among doctor to whom at once applied for mean of taking off dye have asked man brought down with surgeon said say that put on may know of something will take off again have asked know of nothing used of dye stuff of country said never heard of anyone wanting to take dye out of thing have be coloured if be only cotton cloth doctor said have doubt very strong solution of soda must take out greater portion of dye human skin wo stand boiling water however must say that if have water a hot a can bear with plenty of soda soap will do something for doubt if be to take handful two of very fine sand must help great deal if use must not put soda with water will practically take skin off leave face like raw beef steak will be worse than stain indeed in so hot sun a have might be dangerous bring on erysipelas so must be very careful will be far better for to put up with being somewhat singular in appearance for bit than to lay up by taking strong measure to get rid of after hour spent in vigorous washing aided by several rub with very fine sand stanley succeeded to great satisfaction in almost getting rid of tattoo mark on face general dye have faded little though not much that with mark have be made be evidently of le stable character yielded to soap friction before have concluded work two trunk arrived finding that face be now beginning to smart good deal abstained for time from further effort turned to inspect purchase with good deal of interest uniform consisted of two undress suit one with trouser other with breech high boot for riding there be also suit of mess jacket waistcoat trouser three suit of white drill dozen white shirt for mess a many of thin flannel good stock of general underclothes pair of thick boot light pair for mess there be also sword belt other equipment in fact necessary must require for campaign before beginning to dress began to free hair from wax with have be plastered up have obtained from doctor spirit of turpentine with aid of found task le difficult one than have expected regimental barber being sent for by captain cooke hair be soon shortened to ordinary length will do very well now major said a went down into general room have certainly succeeded great deal better than thought must of course look very brown there be good many others nearly a dark a be for between rain shower sun have tremendous power of men face be almost skinned while others have browned wonderfully be sure that many of be quite a dark a yours so will pas muster very well before beginning to wash change stanley have given meinik clothes have carried down with when went out to take short look round before tiffin for servant be already laying cloth found man now looking like respectable burman standing near door walked slowly past man did not move not recognizing in slightest degree in present attire then stanley turned faced so know meinik burman gave start of surprise certainly did not know lord said who must have known before be poor burmese peasant now be english lord not lord at meinik be simply english officer dressed very much same a be when people knocked on head at ramoo know voice meinik said even now that know be hardly recognize face of course tattoo mark made great difference be not think be hair have made most difference meinik see be pulled off brow neck before will be time before will grow naturally again have great trouble to get to lie down even when be wet will certainly have tendency to stick up for long time dress have made good deal of alteration in too be very good clothes meinik said have never have such good one on before have have money enough to buy people must have asked where got from never doe to make show of being better off than one neighbour man be sure to be fleeced if doe what can do for lord nothing at present meinik be going to lunch with officer here to dine with general sleep here tomorrow daresay will move into quarter of own have better buy what want for today in market know whether be well supplied a saw of people about there must be food to be obtained gave plenty to eat when came in said will buy something for supper want money have plenty of lead left have better take couple of rupee anyhow there be sure to be trader from india who have opened shop here wo care to take lead in payment must get fresh muslin for turban have better close up at top time will go better with clothes meinik grinned will look quite like person of importance will be taken for at least headman of large village took two rupee walked off towards town while stanley went in to luncheon there be good many remark a to altered appearance do know brooke one of young lieutenant said did not feel at sure that cooke be not humbugging when introduced to that be not really burman who have travelled have somehow learned to speak english extraordinarily well clothes soap water make wonderful difference stanley laughed will be good many shade lighter when rest of dye wear off at rate can go about now without anyone staring at after tiffin stanley have to tell story again at very much greater length than before certainly have gone through queer adventure major said when have finished relation there be doubt that have have wonderful luck in first place if bullet have gone inch lower must not have be one of four white survivor of ugly business at ramoo then be lucky that did not chop off head when first took when got to ava then again be lucky that bandoola sent special message that wanted kept a interpreter for that official in charge of turned out decent fellow aided to make escape a to obtaining service of man brought down with regard that a question of luck saved man life by act of greatest bravery one not one man in ten must perform try to perform for life of total stranger hope that must have made effort have be in place say frankly that be by mean sure must have done so betting be good twenty to one against being done successfully if brute have heard footstep must have be certain death even when reached chance be strongly against being able to strike blow at animal must for moment disable so give time to snatch up one of gun might not after have be loaded be wonderfully gallant action lad did not tell very much about while be getting dye off got hold of one of trader here who happened to be passing who understood language with assistance questioned fellow got particular from say again be a plucky thing a have ever heard of few minute later orderly came in with note from general asking major captain cooke also to dine with that evening stanley be very pleased that two officer be going with a took away feeling of shyness felt at thought of presenting in staff uniform at general sir archibald campbell put at ease at once by kindness with received stanley began to apologize for dress general stopped at once intended of course that must wear brooke be sure that must not find dress suit in camp however will make matter right tomorrow judging from what said that a can not join uncle at present must be willing to remain here name will appear in order tomorrow morning a being granted commission in th pending arrival of confirmation from home of course in such case be mere form will also appear in order a being appointed aide de camp in place of mr hitchcock with extra pay a interpreter thank having served a volunteer taken part in severe action having be wounded imprisoned have almost right to commission after dinner hope that will give full account of adventure be very slight sketch heard from morning general then introduced stanley to other member of staff if have seen a saw morning said with smile certainly must not recognize now be naked to waist have nothing on usual peasant attire of piece of black cloth reaching to knee knew of course that question of costume must soon be got over own did not think must be able to employ for little time not only be stain great deal darker than be now be thickly tattooed up to eye one must hardly be sending message by aide de camp so singular in appearance see that somehow have entirely got rid of tattoo mark skin be now very little if at darker than of many of so that will be able to put in harness at once after dinner be over cigar lighted stanley told story a before passing over lightly manner in have gained friendship of burman when have finished however major pemberton said with permission general will supplement story little mr brooke have told somewhat more than have told gained whole fact from guide own lip major please stanley said colouring even under dye matter be not worth telling must permit to be judge of mr brooke general said with smile at young fellow interruption of superior officer beg pardon major pemberton stanley stammered in confusion only only must rather that did not tell about struggle with leopard think ought to be told be pretty sure sir archibald campbell will agree with major pemberton then gave full account of adventure in forest thank major be certainly quite right in telling story for be one ought to be told if mr brooke will forgive saying so be one of case in be mistake for man to try to hide light under bushel see can not make difference in estimation in hold most young fellow must a did have joined countryman when threatened by greatly superior enemy again most must if prisoner have taken opportunity offered to effect escape therefore in brief account that gave morning appeared to that have behaved pluckily shrewdly have well earned commission especially a have knowledge of language simply told that have be able to render service to burman who travelled down with such service might have be merely that assisted when be in want bound up wound other small matter now find that performed act of singular courage act even oldest shikaree must have reason to be proud of such act performed too for stranger that stranger enemy must of give man title to esteem regard of among whom might be thrown must lead to regard in entirely different light to in must otherwise have held think that will agree with gentleman certainly there be chorus of assent from circle of officer narrative have a general said shown that young fellow be possessed of coolness steadiness pluck feat be altogether out of common a performed by mere lad seemed little short of marvellous will of course have hitchcock quarter quartermaster general said to stanley a party broke up be small room have advantage of being water tight be more than one can say of

for when have seen one of parsee come round to office will have seen paymaster by time have talked over with how can arrange about horse must think that best way must be to have committee of three

thank very much indeed colonel in morning stanley took one of little parcel from bag opened contained thirty stone of twenty be ruby six sapphire four emerald seemed to of good size a be in rough state have idea what size must be when cut there be three of parsee merchant first went to said at once that did not deal in gem next called on examined stone carefully be impossible to say for certain said how much be worth until be cut for there may be flaw in can not be detected now if be to buy like must not give more than hundred rupee if be flawless must be worth much more must be pure speculation will not go beyond sum stanley then visited third store trader here inspected little more carefully than last have done examined with magnifying glass held up to light then weighed stone

went to quartermaster general office have just finished business colonel adair said a entered major moultrie paymaster colonel watt have examined horse know that hitchcock paid sixty pound apiece for

hundred fifty rupee month so that in four month half will have cleared off be very much obliged to colonel have just received advance of fifteen hundred rupee on of gem parsee be going to send to jeweller of name of burragee at madras congratulate for hardly hoped that must turn out to be worth so much burragee be first rate man can rely upon getting fair price from well that obviates difficulty by way must recommend to get light bedstead bed couple of blanket at one of parsee store of course did not think of yesterday might have bought hitchcock however noticed in one of parsee shop number of light bamboo bedstead be coolest best in climate like if lay couple of blanket on bamboo will find that want mattress know what duty be sir whether general will be wanting will not want today anyhow will know that will be making arrangement moving into quarter by way hitchcock brought syce with must have man for horse have doubt will be glad to stay on with two hour later stanley be installed in quarter room twelve foot long by eight wide bed stood in one corner there be table for writing on two light bamboo chair indian lounging chair in corner be small bamboo table on be large brass basin while great earthenware jar for water stood beside piece of indian matting covered floor learned that staff messed together in large room in next house that must there get cup of coffee

devoted to headquarters after lunch went into general reported a ready for duty will not want afternoon mr brooke here be plan showing position of different corp have better get by heart when get cooler afternoon must advise to ride out examine position road so even at night can if necessary carry message to of regiment burmese be constantly creeping up stabbing sentry sometimes attack in considerable force when anything like heavy firing begin will be duty to find out at once what be going on bring word a may be necessary to send up reinforcement in morning will be duty to examine prisoner who have be taken during night also native who have made way into town in order to ascertain whether date have be fixed for next attack what force be likely to take part in can make man useful at work by way will tell colonel adair to put down on list of quartermaster native follower need not do anything else be likely that native will speak more freely to than must to white officer may a well be earning thirty rupee month drawing ration a hanging about day doing nothing thanking general stanley took plan going back to quarter studied attentively told meinik of arrangement have be made for with burman be much pleased thirty rupee month seemed large sum to be glad that must not be costing stanley money for food three hour later one of horse be brought round started on ride through camp there be two road leading through town to great pagoda be thickly bordered by religious house pagoda latter for most part being in state of dilapidation house pagoda alike have be turned into quarter for troop have be invaluable during wet season terrace of great pagoda be occupied by th regiment madras artillery be most advanced position be key of defence leaving horse in charge of syce at foot of pagoda hill stanley went up to terrace soon entered into conversation with of british officer who at once recognized a having be that morning put in order a general aide de camp a be unknown to everyone ship have come in for day there be naturally much curiosity felt a to who stranger be who have be appointed to commission to coveted post of aide de camp in one day after chatting for two three minute conducted stanley to colonel quarter small building at foot of pagoda be mr brooke colonel gentleman who be gazetted to morning be glad to see mr brooke must be more glad still if have be coming to join for have lost several officer from sickness there be others unfit for duty when did arrive arrived only yesterday morning sir came here in disguise having made way down from ava oh indeed heard report that white man have arrived in disguise at line of th native infantry have have particular beyond be captured at ramoo sir while be acting a officer of native levy fortunately be stunned by graze of musket ball being supposed dead be not killed a be other officer who fell into hand of burmese fury have abated by time came to myself be carried up to ava with twenty sepoy prisoner after time made escape from prison took to forest where remained week till search for have abated somewhat then made way down country for most part in fishing boat journeying only at night so succeeded in getting in here fortunately speak mug dialect be very closely akin to burmese well colonel said hope that will consider regiment home though suppose that until campaign be at end will only be able to pay occasional visit be lucky in getting staff appointment doubt being able to talk burmese have great deal to do with everything think sir general have one on staff who must speak language unless happened to have with one of very few men here who can do so often have to wait time before prisoner must be questioned remained chatting for hour then rode back to town taking other road to have before traversed chapter pagoda two day later prisoner be captured when endeavouring to crawl up pagoda hill having slipped past outpost be sent into headquarters stanley questioned closely must obtain information whatever from telling to sit down by house placed british sentry over keep eye said on door of next house will see burman come out be to let talk with prisoner let one else speak to look a if have order about stand carelessly by fellow will tell nothing be likely enough that will speak to one of own countryman understand sir stanley went into house told meinik what be wanted to do will find out meinik said confidently minute two later went out strolled along past prisoner a did so gave little nod returning again shortly saluted in burmese third time passed looked inquiringly at sentry a if to ask whether might speak to prisoner soldier however appeared to pay attention to stood with grounded musket leaning against wall meinik went up to man be in bad luck said how did manage to fall into hand of people matter not to burman said indignantly since have gone over to not at not at meinik replied do not know that there be many here who like have come in a fugitive with instruction what to do when people attack be expecting news a to when soothsayer declare day to be fortunate one then will be in readiness to do share a soon a firing begin will be on fourth day from burman said know whether will be night before night after soothsayer say will be fortunate night invulnerables will then assault pagoda sweep barbarian away prince woongees will celebrate great annual festival there two day later be good meinik said will be on lookout never fear what be going to do to will cut off head need not be afraid of that white men never kill prisoner after be once taken be safe will be kept for time when countryman have destroyed barbarian taken town will free from prison there be of white officer coming must get away will be asking question a walked away sentry put musket to shoulder began to march briskly up down moment later general stepped up to what be doing man who put on guard over prisoner know name sir sentry said standing at attention be young staff officer came to guard tent called for sentry a be next on duty sergeant sent with put to watch man right keep sharp lookout over wonder what brooke left fellow here for instead of sending to prison general said to colonel adair examined must get nothing out of even when threatened to hang will just run up to quarter ask sir just a entered house stanley be coming down stair general want to know mr brooke why placed prisoner under guard by house instead of sending to prison a usual be just coming to tell sir ah well be outside so can tell together well mr brooke what made put sentry over man leave here men be hard enough worked without having unnecessary sentry duty yes sir only left for few minute be convinced man knew something by demeanour when questioned thought might a well try if man must not get more out of than must so put sentry over gave instruction that be to let burman who must come out of house speak to prisoner that one else be to approach then instructed man a to part that be to play passed two three time making sign of friendship to prisoner then a sentry have apparently objection to speaking to came up at first man must say nothing to meinik told that be one of who have be sent to rangoon to aid when assault took place that be anxiously waiting for news when favourable day must be declared by astrologer so that with must be ready to begin work a soon a attack commenced prisoner fell into snare told that must be made on night before on night of fourth day from when invulnerables have undertaken to storm pagoda seems that date be fixed partly because be fortunate one also in order that prince head official might properly celebrate great annual festival of pagoda fall seems on sixth day from now excellent indeed mr brooke be great relief to to know when assault be going to take place from what point will be delivered what made think of story that burman be one of party have come in to do something be what colonel adair mentioned at dinner last evening sir be saying how awkward must be if of native who have come in be to fire town just a strong attack be going on most of troop engaged with enemy be not unlikely that if plan have be formed prisoner must know of that might very well believe what man said that men have be sent into town with similar intention true enough idea be capital one mr brooke will be ready for night come will please go across to guard tent tell sergeant to send corporal across to man on sentry with order to take prisoner to jail hand over to officer in command there when have done will ride out to pagoda inform colonel what have discovered will be relief to to men for a date of attack have be uncertain have be obliged to largely increase patrol to keep portion of force night under arm will be able to decrease number let men have a much sleep a can for next two night cloud be banking up be very much afraid that rain be going to set in again say that will have two month of after seeing prisoner marched away stanley rode to pagoda saying that have come with message from general be at once shown into colonel quarter news mr brooke yes colonel general have requested to inform at once of news have obtained from prisoner namely that on night of th st position will be attacked by men who be called invulnerables will give chance of proving whether title be justified colonel said cheerfully be very good news men be getting thoroughly worn out with extra night duty caused by uncertainty think that there be doubt that news be correct none sir must hing with prisoner burman pretended to have mission here to kick up row in town when attack began man believing story at once told that attack will be made on pagoda by invulnerables on early morning of fourth day from on next night astrologer having declared that time must be propitious also because be very anxious to have pagoda in hand in order that prince might celebrate great annual festival be held seems two day after colonel laughed be afraid that will have to put off for year general gave special order suppose sir have only just received news ordered to ride over at once to a be sure that must be glad to know that must not be necessary to keep so many men on night duty for next two day thank mr brooke will kindly tell general be very pleased at news doubt will be up here afternoon tomorrow stanley rode back fast be just in time to escape tremendous downpour of rain began few minute after returned went in at once to general be told that be engaged with quartermaster adjutant general therefore went into anteroom where tollemache fellow aide de camp be standing at window looking out at rain be beastly climate grumbled be awful to think that be likely to get two month of will then have to wait at least before country be dry enough to make move be lucky in getting in just now before began be indeed stanley agreed for have ridden off without cloak must have be drenched have begun two minute earlier saw gallop past wondered what be in such hurry about be like when be out in wood not in least there be very little rain near ava though country be good deal flooded where be flat from river being swollen by rain in hill have lovely weather time must like to see little lovely weather here last week have be almost worse than rain steamy heat be like being in vapour bath if be not that be on duty must like to strip go out enjoy shower bath for hour stanley laughed really must be pleasant said think that gained much by hurrying back for gallop have thrown into perspiration might almost a well be drenched by rain except clothes wo suffer so much ah be very well for other grumbled of course after once having wandered about in forest painted up like nigger feel cheerful under almost circumstance for who have be cooped up doing nothing in beastly place be impossible to look at thing cheerfully have heard that enemy be going to attack on tuesday wednesday night no other exclaimed with sudden animation general only came in quarter of hour ago a have two bigwig with of course did not speak to be certain how did hear be quite certain that be unless burmese change mind be not likely prince want to celebrate great annual festival at pagoda on friday so invulnerables be going a think to capture either on tuesday wednesday night have just be up there to tell colonel a to other question how did learn got rather burman did from prisoner be questioning morning must not say anything then man got round believing that be spy something of kind prisoner told about be only going to attack at pagoda can not say be only point that man mentioned must say that must only be there why must only be there because must imagine that even burmese must be beginning to doubt whether must defeat whole force a particularly wish to occupy pagoda on friday must hardly risk attack on other point might end in disaster while what with propitious nature of day fact that invulnerables have undertaken to capture pagoda doubt look upon that a certain suppose that be right brooke well do hope that general will let go up to see fun what even if be raining of course other said indignantly what doe one care for rain when there be something to do why believe that if be coming down in sheet men have to wade through swamp waist deep must march in highest spirit if there be chance of fight with burmans at end of day however be afraid that there be chance of getting off unless chief go there may be attack in other place a say be not likely be possible therefore of course must have to be at hand to carry order of course if take post at pagoda will be right though betting be that will have to gallop off just at most interesting moment presently two officer left general latter bell rang stanley went in saw colonel mr brooke yes sir begged to say that be extremely glad to get news much obliged to for sending so promptly there be occasion for mr tollemache to stay here longer now at five o'clock will ride out to pagoda at rate must want before then will know where to send for be general order for in afternoon there be when thing be quiet hush for two three hour work of aide de camp be indeed generally very light for a there be movement of troop useless parade very few military order to be carried have great deal of time on hand usually took by turn to be on duty for day one off duty being free to pay visit to acquaintance in various camp on board ship during rainy season however very few officer men went beyond shelter unless obliged to do so from two till four five small proportion passed time in sleep stanley have intended to pay visit to larne a captain marryat who have dined at staff mess on previous evening have invited to go on board whenever might be convenient to larne have performed good service in operation against stockade boat have be particularly active successful captain be one of most popular a well a one of most energetic officer in service be to become a popular with future generation a brightest of writer of sea story however day be not favourable for excursion on water stanley therefore went back to room where divesting of jacket sat down at open window read up batch of last newspaper from england have be lent by colonel adair at five o'clock meinik came in to say that horse be at general door stanley hastily put on jacket cloak sallied out general came down in few minute followed by tollemache mounting rode to pagoda here sir archibald have talk with colonel of th officer commanding battery of madras artillery be of opinion that force be amply sufficient to resist attack only approach to from forest be long road between two swamp short distance away have become lake since wet weather set in have taken by surprise colonel said of might have got across before be quite ready for might have given trouble a will be prepared think that of will reach foot of hill if did none of must reach terrace if attack be made from other side must of course be good deal more serious a ground be firm must attack along foot of hill a can not get there until have defeated rest of army consider even without assistance of gun must hold hill with musket bayonet against force that be likely to bring against very well then will not reinforce colonel of course will keep considerable number of troop under arm in case must attack along line at same time that make principal effort here rather hope that rain will keep on until affair be over colonel looked surprised be much more afraid general went on of fire in town than be of attack without number of native there be constantly increasing doubt greater number of who come in be native of place who have managed since cleared out war galley from of creek channel to escape from authority to make way in on foot in fisherman boat of may be sent in a spy to do harm have be having long talk over with colonel adair afternoon quite agrees with that must reckon on probability of attempt to fire town must be terrible blow to if succeeded for loss of store must completely cripple must naturally choose occasion of attack upon line for attempt for in first place most of troop will be under arm drawn up outside town in second place sight of place on fire must cause much confusion must inspirit assailant necessitate considerable force being withdrawn from field to fight fire if rain continue need feel uneasiness whatever for there must be getting anything to burn whereas in dry weather man with torch might light thatch a fast a must run along whole street must be in blaze in two three minute if wind happened to be blowing might make sweep of whole place in spite of effort see that sir own have never given thought before will come up here colonel unless obtain sure news before time arrives that attack be going to be general one indeed be in case best place to post for can see over whole country send order to point where enemy may be making progress where men can advance with advantage line of fire flash will be a good guide at night a smoke by day will get cot rigged up for general a know night be to be thank yes may just a well turn in standing a sailor say get few hour sleep for in climate one can not keep at night day a have to do in spain two aide de camp be kept in suspense a to what general intention be be not until morning of tuesday that said to be going up to pagoda evening mr tollemache have better therefore put provision bottle of brandy into holster at nine in evening rode off rain have ceased moon be shining through cloud will be down by twelve o'clock tollemache said must think most likely will wait for will think that will not be able to take aim at in darkness that will manage to get to foot of hill without loss when reached platform in front of pagoda syces took horse meinik have begged stanley to let take groom place on occasion laying aside dress ordinarily wore assumed light attire of indian syce have run behind horse with others have strong desire to see fighting principal motive in asking to be allowed to accompany stanley be that although greatly impressed with what have seen of drill discipline of white native regiment must not shake off faith in invulnerables have conviction that pagoda must be captured therefore wished to be at hand to bring up stanley horse at critical moment to aid to escape from assailant fire be burning a usual at several point on terrace two company be under arm be standing well back from edge of platform so a to be out of sight of in forest rest of men be sitting round fire musket be piled in line hard by when alighted general proceeded to battery have everything in readiness major asked officer in command yes sir gun be loaded with grape a will be very dark when moon have set have pegged white tape along just under gun so that can be trained upon causeway however dark may be be very good idea general said there be nothing more difficult than laying gun accurately in dark colonel now arrived soldier having brought news to a soon a general reached platform see that be well prepared to give hot reception colonel hope so sir have strong patrol out beyond causeway order be that be to resist strongly for minute two so a to give time to have whole of force in readiness here then be to retreat at double to foot of hill then to open fire again so that may know that be out of way that can begin when like have be making port fire afternoon have dozen men halfway down hill directly outpost be safely across be to light port fire will enable to take aim white tape will be guide enough for artillery men must make very poor shooting if must not make out muzzle of gun anyhow think that be likely that enemy will get across causeway however numerous may be think will colonel certainly so far have shown contemptible in attack have never made successful stand even for minute when once entered stockade though defend pluckily enough until have once got footing inside still fellow ought to fight well tonight for if be beaten will be death blow to reputation among countryman besides many of do believe in power claim a have found before now in india fanatic be always formidable after taking look round with colonel general accompanied to quarter while two aide de camp remained on terrace chatting with officer then after time went with of to mess tent where sat smoking talking until midnight when went out troop be formed up under arm listened impatiently for something must show that long delayed assault must take place night at half past twelve there be sound of shot sent electrical thrill through troop be followed almost immediately by others troop be at once marched forward to edge of platform babel of wild shout went up at sound of first shot followed by burst of firing two aide de camp have taken place close to general who be standing in gap between infantry gun be looking intently through night glass at forest be in dense mass said can not see whether be in regular order be certainly packed great deal closer than have ever before seen in front have got lantern be coming along fast a yet enemy be mile away lantern flash of gun showed exact position while fire of outpost be kept up steadily a latter fell back along causeway interval between two force decreased then fire of outpost ceased a in accordance with order broke into double illustration burmese make great effort to capture pagoda uproar of advancing crowd be prodigious man be yelling at top of voice imprecation upon defender of pagoda who be standing in absolute silence waiting eagerly for word of command suddenly firing broke out again at foot of hill immediately bright light shot up from face edge of dense mass of burmese be now fifty yard from wall surrounded foot of hill causeway behind be occupied by solid mass of men then came sharp order to artilleryman gun after gun poured charge of grape into crowd while at same moment infantry began to fire by company in steady volley for instant din of assailant be silenced then shout rose again after moment hesitation continued advance not for long none most disciplined soldier must have advanced under storm of grape bullet in ten minute fled in wild confusion leaving causeway thickly covered with dead again again british cheer rose loud triumphant then infantry be told to fall out gun continued fire until fugitive be well in forest between shot general listened attentively examined country towards town through glass everything be quiet said be probable that if fellow have carried hill must have made signal there might have be general attack a be affair be over for night invulnerables will have difficulty in accounting for failure loss now gentleman may a well have up horse ride back hardly expected to get away a soon a well meinik what do think of invulnerables now stanley said a burman after picketing horse came up to room to see if wanted anything before lying down on bed in passage know burman replied gravely may be holy men proof perhaps against native weapon be good against cannon musket understand now how be that beat so easily men stood quiet in order one only heard voice of officer crash a fired together then gun be terrible have seen ours firing though piece be smaller than yours men fire five shot to one stood by while be loading be wonderful nobody talked nobody gave order man knew what have to do one did something directly did something almost before smoke of last shot be out of gun be ready to be fired again be clear to that have not learnt how to fight that way of having only few men well taught knowing exactly what have to do be better than ours of having great number letting everyone fight a plea be bad way brave men get to front be killed then others run away be right will never turn out of rangoon till bandoola come have best troop with have never be beaten troop know will fight for a will not fight for prince who know nothing of war be chosen only because be king brother when come will see doubt will meinik will see that although may make better fight of than have done tonight will be just same in end for next two month time passed slowly attack be made by enemy after defeat of assault upon pagoda peasant deserter who came in reported that there be profound depression among burmese troop great number have left colour there be talk of attack troop being therefore relieved of much of arduous night duty english took offensive stockade on dalla river upon panlang branch principal passage into main stream of irrawaddy be attacked carried enemy suffering heavily many piece of artillery being captured rain continued almost unceasingly troop suffered terribly in health scarce three thousand remained fit for duty greater portion of be so emaciated exhausted by effect of climate that be altogether unfit for active operation three week after fight at pagoda vessel came up river with letter from officer in command of troop assembled to bar advance of bandoola against chittagong saying that burmese army have mysteriously disappeared have gone off at night so quietly silently that outpost be short distance from heard sign movement whatever burmese have taken with sick tent store nothing large quantity of grain have be found in deserted stockade news be received with satisfaction by troop there be little doubt that court of ava finding that general have failed in making slightest impression upon line have lost vast number of men have at last turned to leader who have conquered province after province for have sent order to march with whole army to bring struggle to close soldier rejoiced at thought that be at last to meet real burmese army hitherto have generally stood on defensive have to fight climate rather than foe seemed to that campaign be likely to be interminable march of burmese from ramoo to sembeughewn nearest point of river to former town must have be terrible one distance be over two hundred mile rain be ceaseless country covered with jungle marsh intersected by river other army must have accomplished feat burmans however accustomed to unhealthy climate lightly clad carrying weight save arm sixteen day supply of rice passed rapidly over man be accustomed to use of axe to formation of raft in incredibly short time river be crossed deep swamp traversed on road made by closely packed faggot few day after hearing that bandoola have started general learned from peasant that news have come down that portion of army have arrived at sembeughewn almost at same time other party who travelled down along coast reached donabew town on irrawaddy forty mile in direct line from rangoon have be named a rendezvous of new army to considerable proportion of bandoola force made way direct from ramoo being custom of burmese to move when on march through country where opposition be to be looked for in separate detachment under own leader choosing own way making for general rendezvous travelling in manner performed journey far more rapidly than must have done moving in one body must better find shelter food other force from prome tannoo other quarter be known to be marching towards donabew be soon reported that dejected force around rangoon have gained courage confidence at news that bandoola army be coming to aid that deserter be returning in large number from village british sick be sent away in shipping to mergy tavoy two coast town of have taken possession of be healthily situated change have marvellous effect men who must have speedily succumbed to poisonous exhalation of swamp round rangoon rapidly regained strength in new quarter chapter victory in meantime negotiation have be going on with siam between state burma there be bitterest enmity have be thought that siam must have willingly grasped opportunity to revenge for many loss of territory that have suffered at hand of burma there be doubt that must have be glad to do occupation of several point on coast of tenasserim roused fear of siam inclined to belief that might prove even more dangerous neighbour than burma court of ava have on part also sent urgent message to king of siam when misfortune have to extent lowered pride calling upon to make common cause with burma to join in repelling enemy who must doubtless be a dangerous to a to burma siam however determined to steer middle course army be assembled in readiness for contingency siam believed a little a burma that british must possibly be victorious over power feared vengeance if be to ally with while upon other hand siam have long sea coast feared injury fleet might inflict upon be to join burma king therefore gave power assurance of friendship marched army down to frontier of province of martaban bordered on great salween river on tenasserim coast lay two hundred mile from rangoon across gulf of martaban intention of king being so doubtful advance of siamese army in direction must not be regarded with indifference by british town of martaban be centre of burmese military power in tenasserim advance towards of siamese army must place in direct communication with of burma on th of october therefore force consisting of wing of st regiment rd madras infantry sailed from rangoon against town expedition be delayed by light wind when arrived at mouth of river found that preparation have be made for obstinate defence learned from peasant strong work have be erected on eminence round town that road from coast have be cut stockaded approach by route be impossible for there be twenty mile of country to be traversed much of be under water from inundation be therefore determined to go up river although be so willow full of shoal that navigation be extremely difficult at last after great labour incurred by ship constantly getting ashore succeeded in making way up to martaban anchored off town heavy cannonade be carried on for time between ship enemy work then troop be embarked in boat rowed for shore under very heavy fire from enemy a soon a landed advanced to attack stockade burmese lost heart hastily retreated while inhabitant received troop a entered with warmest welcome for be for most part native of pegu still entertained deep hatred for burmese because of long oppression that have suffered at hand throughout rest of tenasserim however indeed throughout whole country traversed by troop later on inhabitant appeared to have entirely forgotten ancient nationality conquest of country by burmans to have become completely absorbed by throughout whole time that occupied martaban people gave trouble whatever indeed offered to raise force for service with if wished at end of october rain ceased to intense delight of troop cold season set in november be however exceptionally deadly month occasional day of fine weather drawing up exhalation from swamp number of death be greater than have be at previous time there be too prospect of forward movement at present expedition have come unprovided with boat other mean of transport making sure that abundant supply must be obtained in country where whole trade be carried on by river promptness with native authority have on first appearance of fleet sent boat away have disappointed anticipation although opening of of other river have enabled local fisherman to bring boat to rangoon where fish be eagerly purchased british troop be still up to end of november without mean of sending hundred men up river save in boat of fleet indian authority believing that when burmese found impotent to turn out of rangoon court of ava must be glad to negotiate have not until autumn be drawing to close thought of making preparation to supply army with water carriage now however began to bestir five hundred boatman be sent from chittagong bringing many boat down with building others at rangoon transport with draft cattle sailed from bengal considerable reinforcement of troop be on way to join at end of december for native agreed that movement must be made by land until end of january in november even bandoola army be obliged to make approach by water early in month be learned that burmese general have given order for advance preparation be at once begun to meet what none doubted must be very serious attack reinforcement have not yet arrived greatly diminished force be far too small for length of line have to be defended redoubt be therefore thrown up pagoda other building be fortified two complete line of work constructed from great pagoda to city one facing east other west post at kemmendine be strengthened be supported by h m sloop sophie company cruiser strong division of gunboat retention of post be of great importance a barred river approach to rangoon prevented enemy sending down huge fleet of war galley fire raft to attack town set fire to merchant shipping lying off in last week of november smoke be seen to rise from many point in forest many fugitive came in from village reported bandoola army be on way down river by end of month sixty thousand men with large train of artillery body of cavalry be assembled round position of force thirty thousand be armed with musket have with too great number of jingals little gun carried ball of from six to twelve ounce be mounted on light carriage two men must wheel with ease cannon be carried to scene of action on elephant cavalry be seven hundred strong drawn from border of manipur rest of army be armed with sword spear carried implement for stockading entrenching force be accompanied by number of astrologer by invulnerables who have doubtless satisfactorily explained failure to capture pagoda great semicircle of light smoke rising from tree showed that position taken up by bandoola extended from river above kemmendine to neighbourhood of rangoon on night of st troop at pagoda heard loud continuous stir in forest gradually approached by morning great mass of troop have gathered at edge of jungle within musket shot of post garrison there be drawn up in readiness to repel sudden rush just a sun rose din made by thousand of men engaged in cutting down tree began be evident that burmese be going to adopt usual plan of entrenching behind stockade during time have elapsed between repulse of invulnerables arrival of bandoola army stanley work be light life dull monotonous hour be spent morning in examining fugitive who have by retreat of burmese be enabled to make way back to town of woman who have escaped from vigilance of burmese police have come in from village where have be held a hostage for husband once twice week went off with general to hospital ship to inquire into state of sick to pay visit to long line of cot along main lower deck almost day rode in spite of weather to one other of regimental camp soon came to know most of officer of force previous experience on river have done much to acclimatise health continued good on evening of th have at general order ridden up to pagoda be considered likely that attack must be delivered there in first place at three o'clock in morning when became evident that large body of men be approaching through forest galloped back to rangoon with news at five rode out again with sir campbell among garrison there be much disappointment when sound of wood chopping announced that burmese did not intend to attack general who have be watching edge of jungle through glass lowered put into case with expression of satisfaction want to attack colonel said if do beat off be nearer end than before sort of thing might be carried on for month a long in fact a there remains man to bring up what want be to inflict heavy blow upon even court at ava may become convinced that can not hope to drive out of rangoon in case may consent to negotiate may bring war to end heaven know that have suffered enough loss at present want to have to undertake such difficult operation a advance against ava be glad to see that have begun to construct stockade intend to interfere until have completely finished work gained sufficient confidence to make general attack on then will be able to give heavy lesson ah there be at work a spoke roar of musketry artillery broke out suddenly from kemmendine eye be turned in direction spot be two mile distant forest shut out alike view of river of work held by exact position however be indicated by mast of two war vessel rising above tree soon great wreath of heavy white smoke rose above forest in around kemmendine shutting out view fire continued without abatement be evident that attack be hot determined one confident a felt that little fort must be able to defend successfully great smoke cloud be watched with feeling of anxiety for garrison be after handful in momentary interval of firing yell shout of native must be distinctly heard once twice after heavy broadside from ship of war cheer of british sailor must be plainly recognized after two hour fighting din gradually ceased cloud of smoke rolled away mast of ship became visible garrison of pagoda raised three hearty cheer to tell defender successful defence have be watched welcomed presently heavy column of enemy issued from forest on other side of river marched across plain to dalla faced rangoon moved with great regularity order led by chief on horseback gilded umbrella glittering in ray of sun on reaching bank of river opposite rangoon began entrenching throwing up stockade battery with evident intention of opening fire on shipping soon afterwards large body of men issued from forest facing pagoda marching along slight ridge extended from point to creek below rangoon took up position there began entrenching along line thus british position be now completely surrounded there be however doubt that main body of enemy be still facing pagoda must see what be doing general said be too important point for to allow to erect strongly fortified position close at hand accordingly tollemache be sent down with order to th madras infantry supported by detachment of th regiment under major sale to advance against enemy in jungle movement of force be eagerly watched from terrace of pagoda at rapid pace crossed intervening ground rattle of musketry broke out from jungle a approached british made response charged with cheer be soon lost to sight in tree regular volley must be heard at short interval above scattered rattle of burmese musketeer cheer frequently rose loud triumphant in hour red line emerged again from jungle having destroyed stockade burmese have erected captured several gun quantity of musket entrenching tool thrown away by burmese killed large number of enemy during day enemy made repeated effort to send fire raft down river from above kemmendine raft be constructed of bamboo upon be placed great number of earthenware pot filled with petroleum raft be skilfully constructed made in section so that when drifted against anchor chain must divide on side swinging round so a to envelop ship on side with fire sailor from sloop gunboat rowed up to meet raft although heavy fire be kept up by enemy from jungle lining bank succeeded in towing most of safely to shore while rest grounded on projecting spit off kemmendine so diligently did burmese work at point throughout day by afternoon whole line of circumvallation be covered with earthwork behind lay entirely hidden from sight if must fight a well a dig build stockade sir campbell remarked must be one of most formidable enemy in world european army ever accomplished work of entrenching so speedily a have done arrangement have be admirable everything have be done without confusion body have taken up position allotted to a be evident by fact that there be gap in line a to bandoola tactic can not say so much for in first place have divided force into two part separated by river incapable of helping other in next place great a be number line be far too extended well will let go on for time then show mistake that have committed major sale report of entrenchment be that consisted of long line of hole capable of containing two men earth be dug out on one side so a to form sort of cave in be bed of straw brushwood on one man must sleep while other watched hole contained sufficient supply of rice water even fuel for inmate one line of hole have be completed be being dug short distance in advance burmese relieve men in trench who occupy line first made remain there fresh men dig occupy next line so advance be continued until close to work to be attacked system have great advantage that shell falling into one of hole only kill two occupant instead of destroying many a might do if fell in continuous trench in afternoon general returned to rangoon leaving stanley at pagoda with order to ride down must there be change of importance in evening considerable force of burmese issued from jungle prepared to entrench near northeast angle of pagoda hill major piper therefore took two company of th descending hill drove burmese in confusion back to jungle in morning be found that enemy have entrenched upon high open ground within musket shot of north gate of pagoda be separated from gate by large tank a jingals musketry be able from point occupied to sweep plateau hut occupied by troop party of th th madras infantry went out drove off a soon however a troop fell back burmese reoccupied position for next few day constant skirmishing went on at point while artillery fire be maintained by assailant defender along whole line down to rangoon enemy battery at dalla kept up incessant fire on shipping kemmendine be attacked time after time many attempt made to launch fire raft down river work be very harassing for troop night day be expecting attack in force there be general feeling of delight when on evening of th order be issued for general movement against enemy latter have by time brought greater portion of gun up from jungle placed in entrenchment be therefore in power of british to strike heavy blow division of flotilla of gunboat be ordered up creek by town opened heavy fire upon enemy flank thus attracting attention to point after cannonade have continued for little time two column of attack one eight hundred strong under major sale other five hundred under major walker of madras army issued out latter be to attack enemy facing town former to force way through centre of position have with troop of horse have landed only previous day major walker force be first to encounter enemy resistance be for time obstinate major walker several other officer fell in attack on first line of entrenchment soldier carried at point of bayonet a enemy broke retreated followed so hotly that work in rear fell into hand with slight opposition major sale column now began attack on enemy centre here resistance be more feeble bursting through enemy line british drove before in headlong flight then turning swept along line of entrenchment carrying before until effected junction with other column be advancing to meet then drove burmese from part of work into jungle leaving ground behind covered with dead wounded except at point first attacked by major walker resistance of burmese be very feeble british loss inconsiderable large number of gun entrenching tool musket fell into hand of victor next day bandoola rallied troop have be driven from plain gathered greatest part of force in forest round pagoda where continued to push forward work with unabated energy british have day of rest given on th prepared to attack enemy at point four column of attack be formed composed of detachment drawn from corp of army in morning heavy cannonade be opened upon jungle artillery being assisted by several heavy gun have with great labour be brought up by sailor from ship to pagoda enemy returned with steady fire of light artillery jingals musketry while firing be still going on four column be already in motion one have entered jungle on enemy left on right one of central column advanced from foot of pagoda hill while th regiment descended stair from north gate advanced one wing on side of tank against enemy entrenchment on high ground a four column approached enemy artillery fire ceased burmese appeared for moment bewildered at sight of foe advancing against from so many direction soon opened very heavy fire upon assailant kept up with undiminished steadiness until troop advancing at charge dashed into entrenchment drove before into thick forest behind where pursuit must at time have be difficult be now impossible troop exhausted by seven day night watching being wholly incapable of following active lightly armed enemy there now remained force at dalla to cope with in evening force composed of th rd madras infantry under colonel parlby embarked in boat night be dark troop crossed unobserved alarm be not given until british actually entered entrenchment opened fire upon enemy who be sitting unsuspicious of danger round fire scarcely opposition be encountered whole of work with gun store be soon in hand while enemy be flying towards forest in action during three day burmese lost men piece of artillery of kind great number of musket vast supply of ammunition while british have killed wounded great number of bandoola men never rejoined army whole force be dispersed through country bandoola be retiring towards donabew with remnant of army when met considerable reinforcement on way to join during operation have left reserve corp at village of kokein four mile from pagoda have be busily entrenching position commanded road leading from rangoon to donabew ground be elevated on arrival there bandoola set troop now in number to aid in work in marvellously short time height be completely stockaded with trunk of tree with broad deep ditch in front beyond be line of felled tree head pointing outwards branch sharpened forming very formidable abattis believing to be impregnable bandoola awaited attack of british a soon a army have be dispersed great number of deserter of inhabitant of village poured into rangoon with deserter be mingled good many of troop sent in by bandoola with instruction to fire town in order to lull suspicion of british caused report to be spread that imperial commissioner from court of ava must arrive in course of few day to treat for term of peace general however determined to attack bandoola before commissioner must arrive a be evident that better term must be obtained after total dispersion of burmese than if famous general remained with men in formidable position close at hand be uneasy at presence of so large number of native in town precaution have be taken against fire time before be now redoubled be one to break out not only might whole of store collected for advance of army be destroyed if bandoola have force gathered in readiness at edge of jungle might take advantage of confusion must be caused by fire rush forward to attack of town number of troop of sailor from fleet patrolled street in direction at night in spite of effort week after retreat of bandoola dreaded cry of fire be raised at dozen point on windward side of town fire have be lighted by incendiary a there be brisk wind blowing danger be extreme drum beat to arm along whole of british line order have already be issued a to what be to be done in such emergency while portion of troop lined trench rest be marched at once to town formed up between jungle to repel attack might be made there leaving troop quartered in town sailor of fleet to battle with flame for time seemed a if whole place must be swept away by levelling line of hut beating out flame at barrier so formed progress be at length checked not until more than town have be destroyed fortunately be half farthest from river with exception of commissariat store for supply of troop of madras presidency building containing food ammunition necessary for army escaped unharmed what have happened once might however happen again in spite of precaution general therefore determined to attack bandoola at once a be force once scattered motive for incendiary fire must cease to operate difficulty be formidable one two light field piece must at most be taken with column must have to march by narrow winding footpath through thick forest exposed at moment to desperate attack by enemy moreover must be necessary to leave strong force for defence of rangoon a bandoola must be sure to learn from spy of intended movement having with men intimately acquainted with forest track must make rush down upon town during absence of so many of defender general felt imperative however to attack without delay early on morning of th moved out with force of men against kokein marched without molestation through forest on reaching confines must see truly formidable nature of work that be to attack moment issued from forest dropping fire be opened upon by party of enemy in flank rear time be lost in preparing for assault th light infantry th madras with cavalry under brigadier general cotton be ordered to move round stockade assault on left rear while rest of troop strong with cavalry under general be to attack in front enemy work consisted of central entrenchment connected with two large entrenched stockade on flank somewhat advanced in front of a soon a force under general cotton have gained position in rear of enemy gun be fired whole force moved forward to assault burmans regarded attack by so insignificant force upon work with such contempt that did not for time fire shot continued chanting war song swaying to cadence stamping beating time with hand on breast delay proved fatal to when opened fire assailant be already close to ditch leaping down into be sheltered from fire of defender scaling ladder be speedily placed troop running up leaped down into entrenchment astounded at sudden entry into work have deemed impregnable burmese hesitated assailant being joined by comrade from behind rushed impetuously upon enemy column in rear have greater difficulty for have several strong stockade to carry before reached central work lost four officer eight men killed forty nine officer men wounded in th regiment alone fifteen minute after first shot be fired whole of work be in possession burmese who gathered in confused mass have be decimated by volley be now in full flight many being cut down by cavalry before reached shelter of wood british troop marched back to rangoon while burmese retreated to donabew leaving strong post on two river leading in direction retirement left free to country people to return to rangoon very large number came in including very many of villager who have be forced to fight against have alike suffered from famine hardship even woman have be compelled to labour in work of stockading suffering of have be terrible work of rebuilding town began at once wooden hut sprang up with great rapidity market be opened in short time supply of fish fruit game vegetable poured in sufficient not only for native population to effect most welcome change in diet of troop a most of native be accustomed to construction management of boat work of preparing flotilla by troop be to proceed up river went on rapidly number of men be hired a servant driver for commissariat with force be very insufficiently supplied a native of india of class for most part refused on account of caste prejudice to engage for service across sea reinforcement arrived rangoon six week before presented miserable deserted appearance be towards beginning of january cheerful bustling town preparation be being made in other quarter to assume offensive men be driving burmese out of assam force strong be marching from sylhet to expel from cachar capture manipur while men be assembled at chittagong be advancing into aracan with intention of driving burmese from province meant if possible to cross mountain effect junction with sir archibald campbell force first part of operation be conducted with complete success aracan wrested from burma be found impossible to perform terrible journey across mountain swamp to afford aid to main expedition chapter advance while preparation for advance be being made general aide de camp have be kept at work from morning until night there be constant communication between military naval authority for expedition be to be mixed one transport be daily arriving with troop store innumerable matter connected with organization of land water transport required to be arranged general be indefatigable in superintending detail of work have be settled that advance must not take place until second week in february a road must be impassable until time th be fixed for commencement of operation upon day after arrival at rangoon stanley have written letter to uncle giving brief account of adventure stating that have be appointed one of general aide de camp said that must of course be guided by uncle wish now that have entered on campaign a officer must certainly like to remain till end when must at once resign commission rejoin sent to uncle agent at calcutta received answer until end of december after expressing delight at hearing that stanley have not a have supposed be killed at ramoo be now safe well in british camp went on only received letter morning for have be moving about from point to point owing to falling off of trade have occasion to go to calcutta until now be indeed astounded at finding letter lying for here a have not forwarded having idea where be knowing that chance of letter sent on reaching be extremely small by mean lad stop where be trade be improving again for now bandoola army have marched away from ramoo scare among native have pretty well subsided still can manage very well without will certainly be great advantage to to serve for year in army to have be one of campbell aide de camp will be feather in cap will give good position at military station be very glad now that abstained from writing to mother after battle at ramoo thought over over concluded that be just a well to leave matter alone for time not have slightest idea even hope that be alive because thought that cessation of letter from must to extent prepare mind for blow when came must be very improbable that must see gazette with list of killed wounded at ramoo even if did so must not associate death of ensign brooke in way with when have be trading up country there have be once twice mean of sending off letter for couple of month therefore must not have begun to feel seriously anxious about before received letter from rangoon everyone say that will not be able to advance until february so that doubt letter will reach long before leave hear loss have be very heavy from fever be not anxious about on score for think that be thoroughly acclimatised be trying to get contract for supply of couple of thousand bullock for use of army a know country so well from chittagong to sylhet can buy below indian price think that will not only get contract make very good thing of may lead to other matter after stanley be hardly surprised when in last week of january uncle walked into quarter after first pleasure of meeting be over stanley said suppose have got contract uncle have lad have come down from ramgur with six dhow packed full have brought thousand head down directly land be going back for remainder will be ready for by time get there have got hold of uncommonly good fellow be established a small trader at chittagong business be ruined there be glad to accept offer of berth have turned out very energetic pushing fellow will come down with next consignment be going to work way up along edge of tipperah forest will pick up thousand head by time get to goomtee will send by water up to sylhet then go up by land picking up more on way have contract for five thousand to be sent in thousand month for force be to move against manipur while johnson be to send two thousand down here so see for present store business can wait be good line have got into will make big profit out of have hope that will be to extent permanent for can get cattle so cheap in interior on river know that can ship to calcutta at lower term than can buy in india be a much a told that if carried out present contract satisfactorily must get supply of troop there of course must not be very great thing of a must work without trouble in connection with own business must make handsome addition to profit how about money uncle be right lad have difficulty whatever in getting advance at calcutta on strength of contract upon guarantee of agent so be right in respect asked uncle because can let have eighteen hundred pound if want tom pearson looked at in astonishment why what on earth have be doing robbing treasury of king of ava uncle have bag of gem given by burmese bandit when got down here took few of to merchant advanced fifteen hundred rupee on sent to burragee jeweller at madras six week afterwards paid three thousand five hundred sent up batch last week got order from jeweller for fifteen hundred pound so that have more than eighteen hundred in hand now think have sent more than third of gem away well be piece of luck stanley why on earth did brigand give gem well uncle be thing that from what told there be great difficulty risk in trying to dispose of be royal monopoly nobody dare buy if do will give next to nothing for because of risk of transaction because know that vendor be in fix must sell besides there be strong chance of handing over anyone who offer such thing to authority be one reason why gave to then too have made good haul of merchandise be to great deal more valuable a there be difficulty in disposing of lastly have taken fancy to because saved one of comrade life man who showed up here well lad will tell about evening must be going down to commissariat yard to arrange landing of beast came straight to see directly landed dropped anchor here at daybreak will go with uncle will run in see chief first get leave off for day have earned holiday for have be at work pretty well morning noon night for last two month see have not only duty of aide de camp of interpreter have helped both quartermaster department commissariat in making arrangement with native daresay will be able to help to hurry business on quicker than must be able to get done alone general at once granted stanley leave went with uncle down to commissariat office introduced to senior officer will be glad to do in power to help mr pearson officer said have be expecting arrival for last week of course heard from calcutta that have contract for two thousand head at least half of be to be delivered by tenth of february be getting rather anxious about force will probably want to start before time will have to victual land water column of course did not know that be relation of mr brooke must have mentioned to that be likely to come must like to get off a soon a possible tom pearson said for by time get back to ramgur rest of cattle will be in readiness for will write order for four large boat at once if have come three week sooner might have be kept waiting day number of native craft have of late come down river that be enabled to get sufficient for work officer gave note to one in charge of landing arrangement be lucky that have come just at moment latter said have just made last trip with baggage of th have six boat disengaged may a well take craft in question be of have be captured unwieldy craft took fish salt up river be almost a large a dhow in cattle have be brought down drew very much le water be towed off to dhow one by one by two captured war canoe having thirty rower one be taken to dhow work of transhipping cattle began at once be in good condition for although closely packed have be well supplied with food water on way down herdsman with four men under have be sent in boat to take care of a tom pearson be very anxious that first consignment must be reported upon favourably animal be landed in course of afternoon with acknowledgment of receipt in excellent order in pocket contractor went off again with stanley to own dhow have told to have everything in readiness to drop down river with tide tomorrow morning will turn just about sunrise be rare bit of business stanley doubt if contractor ever got work through so quickly before of course be principally due to must never have pushed thing through so quickly have not gone with thought that very likely might be detained here week before must get cattle on shore by time if go well will be at ramgur again now can have comfortable evening talk be very much better than going to dine with at mess for there be great deal to hear about daresay can give a good dinner a must have have on shore good deal better stanley said thing have improved immensely during last month still mess cook be certainly not so good a man at rate quiet of cabin make very pleasant change after always sitting down with large party after dinner be over stanley gave full account of adventure from time that be taken prisoner have done wonderfully well for lad wonderfully well certainly when picked up burmese from man have idea that be ever likely to turn out so useful thought that must have be assistance among mug on coast have too idea that war might lead to opening of trade up irrawaddy have turned out infinitely more useful than if must not have spoken burmese bandoola must never have thought of asking for to be spared a interpreter if have not done so must have have head chopped off at ava of course leopard business be turning point of fortune though have turned out so well must say that hardly think that be justified in risking life in such desperate act for native who might for aught know be already dead of course be most gallant action betting be ten to one against succeeding however a turned out be fortunate business altogether say that might not have made way down to rangoon unaided odds must have be very heavily against however ruby be windfall indeed will take rest of uncle sell at calcutta will send to madras home to england will take with to calcutta if like stanley say that there be better men there than one sent to at madras think of do larger business up country with native prince who care what give for good gem at rate will take there get valued by expert then try two three of leading firm get offer if be a high a value put on by expert must send to england through agent who must do best must for for uncle of course be in partnership business have just got contract will pay well while have be doing have be getting hold of ruby think that be fair stanley uncle said gravely seems to perfectly fair besides money put into business will make lot of difference will certainly pay great deal better than must in other way sent home pound for mother directly money came from calcutta told hoped to be able to send home at least a much year good deal more lad if like calculate contract have got will bring in pound head so that by time that war be over hope to have cleared pound will be about what will make by ruby when trade begin again will be in position to do on big scale still think that will not be fair to take money well uncle if wo take certainly wo have anything to do with money that make while be away so please let say anything more about will give that eighteen hundred now will have order upon paymaster in calcutta must be best way if will have so lad have left money with johnson at ramgur for next herd be to come down here have order from agent on agent at dalla for be going to buy for manipur column so want money now suppose dhow be to be lost going up cash might go with so do get order have better send straight to bothron tell to collect credit to account how long do think that business be going to last depends how far have to go before burmese decide that have have enough of at present general hope be that a soon a arrive at prome will give in if may have to go up to ava in case may not finish until time next year for suppose operation will have to come to stop when wet season begin again must hardly reach ava before expect day will have to take whole country stanley may frighten court into submission when approach capital fancy will never keep to term that will insist upon that there will have to be expedition be generally way be so at mysore have be so in dozen other place when have done work have got at mercy give comparatively easy term a soon a recover from effect of defeat set to work again to prepare for tussle then have expense loss of life to incur again then end by annexing territory might just a well have done in first place may be very well to be lenient when one be dealing with european enemy magnanimity doe not pay when have to do with oriental who care rap for treaty engagement who always regard concession a being simply proof of weakness there must not be difficulty in annexing burma that there must be in case of large province in india for town most even of village lie on river couple of dozen gunboat must suffice to keep whole country in order will see that be what will have to do day will cost two three expedition to do what might just a well be done now well uncle be nearly twelve o'clock a will be on duty at six think have better be going wish that must have stayed for two three day paid visit to pagoda camp be very glad have have sight of again though be very short one must be glad to stay day two stanley be really of importance for to get down to ramgur a soon a can send johnson off with cattle for want to set about buying herd for other column a quickly a possible think have left fair margin of time there be nothing like promptitude in delivery want to get good name for future business if affair here be going to last twelve month regular supply must be sent up for a beef be forbidden by burmese religion keep cattle except for draught purpose army must get bullock by sea five minute later stanley be rowed ashore next morning accompanied general went down to inspect newly arrived cattle be capital lot said to stanley decidedly best that have have yet see be good deal shorter voyage from ramgur than from calcutta madras animal probably have much shorter land journey before be shipped then too a uncle came down be doubt much better looked after than usual on voyage however will take care to mention when write next to calcutta that cattle be far above average will be glad if will arrange for such further supply a may require from same source thank sir will be great help to uncle hitherto have have very uphill work of though be beginning to get on very well when war put stop to trade know whole country so thoroughly that can certainly buy up cattle at many place where european trader save have ever penetrated doubt brooke hope for sake that will succeed well in contracting business have certainly made excellent start a be first in field in country between assam ramgur ought to make good thing of opportunity have fallen in way know that take long time to build up business when foundation be laid man be quick in taking advantage of opportunity can do a much in year a might do in twenty without now be going over to line of th to see how have shaken down into regiment have brought out tent for a building be already occupied be necessary that must be put under canvas general found that everything be arranged in order encampment certainly presented pleasing contrast to irregular often crowded quarter of troop who have passed wet season there colonel three of officer dined with general that evening party being made up of military staff including two aide de camp two day later stanley with of other member of staff dined at th mess stanley be introduced to several of officer be specially desirous of making acquaintance a have learned that have be prisoner at ava must therefore tell much more than have hitherto learned of country into be about to advance among be young lieutenant also of name of brooke stanley have three week before attained same rank at time that be appointed to rd there be already several death vacancy in regiment disease fighting have carried off six more officer whole of ensign have consequently obtained step at dinner found placed next to namesake be curious having same name other remarked a sat down be not very common one have not met anyone of same name before stanley said indeed until affair at ramoo be nearly three year trading with uncle of mine up river be not much in way of falling in with white men before have be with father in good many station in india a far a can remember recollect meeting anyone of same name then father be in service too yes be captain in th native infantry indeed other said in surprise then be connection have idea captain brooke be ever married be married just after came out to india stanley said so be likely enough that must never have heard of died three year ago mother sister be now in england what be connection between have never heard father speak much of family father be cousin of mine second cousin think fancy there be row between grandfather rest of family know anything about right wrong of for be of course many year before be born never heard of father existence until fortnight before left england then there be inquiry made about family owing to various death took place in do know that father be related distantly of course to earl of netherly do remember mentioning once know said that be distant connection that knew nothing whatever about earl family well curiously enough be not so distant now other said be pretty distant connection of be childless family generally seem to have be prolific good many of died result be that year before left england uncle of mine succeeded to title have son father be next brother father died two year ago result be that to astonishment found that be next heir to title wanted to leave army when regiment be ordered out to india of course be not going to do for aunt may die uncle marry again have child besides be not going to leave anyhow just a regiment be ordered abroad might see service however there be great hunting by lawyer in genealogical tree know be decided that in case anything happened to father must have be next heir have be alive know whether further inquiry be made whether ever ascertained that have married suppose there be for of course a long a live matter be of importance so that a thing stand now if burmese bullet put end to career be next heir to title surprise indeed stanley said from way father spoke of matter be sure that have not slightest idea there be likelihood whatever that must have chance of succeeding to title can well imagine for be not until few year ago when death of several who stood between succession occurred that uncle regarded coming into a matter worth thinking about of course family stood between father however a see have dwindled away if get safely through business be next heir be curious news to hear at dinner in burma stanley said thoughtfully at rate can assure honestly that news give particular satisfaction suppose must be nice thing to come in for peerage prospect out here be good have intention of staying in army after end of war be really in partnership with uncle with whom have be for last three year in business be turning out very well like life have chance of making enough to retire on with ample mean certainly must not like to come into title by death of anyone knew be fortune of war other said smiling get step by death vacancy be sorry for death step be not unwelcome by way name be harry know yours be stanley vote that call other by be cousin know suppose that a be heir must be nearest male relation at present so vote that call other by christian name instead of brookeing other always will be very glad to do so stanley said cordially hope that will be close friend a well a distant relation then a there be momentary lull in conversation harry raised voice said to colonel very curious thing have just happened colonel brooke have just discovered that be cousin what be still more curious that if anything happens to take place a next heir to uncle fact of be entirely ignorant be certainly very curious coincidence brooke very singular then have not met before did not even know of existence colonel have indeed idea captain brooke father have be married cousinship be distant one there be question whatever a to being next in succession to myself to peerage discovery excited general interest quite turned conversation for time from subject of war of approaching advance after dinner be finished many of officer gathered round stanley asking question about nature of country experience a captive in hand of burmese presently colonel adair who have also dined at mess joined group suppose mr brooke said newly found cousin have told about adventure with leopard colonel have not said anything about leopard be grievously afflicted with colonel went on so will tell for for think ought to know that be not only able to speak dozen language that be capable of doing deed of exceptional gallantry can go chat with colonel brooke be anxious to hear report a to country will be trumpeter here stanley gladly moved away entered into conversation with colonel of th while colonel adair related adventure with leopard to cousin officer standing round by jove be plucky thing harry brooke said admiringly be indeed colonel agreed a similar exclamation went round circle think one man in hundred must have attacked leopard with weapon knife except to save life of comrade even then must be most desperate action have done good deal of big game shooting in india be certain that nothing strong affection for comrade in grasp of leopard must induce to risk almost certain death in way cousin did must never have heard of if have not got detail from man saved who have since attached to a servant be man who a daresay did tell served a companion guide in making way down here at rate see brooke cousin be uncommonly fine young fellow have reason to be proud of relationship feel so colonel be really pleasure to know that if one doe go down thoroughly good fellow will benefit by instead of unknown person who might be very objectionable representative of family for next three four day bustle of preparation went on on fifth detachment be sent up with sloop gunboat to attack advanced position of enemy on lyne river although burmese who be posted in strong stockade be supported by thirty six gun work be carried by storm with little loss two branch of pellang rangoon river by force be to advance against donabew be on following day reconnoitred for distance number of fire raft be destroyed burmese be too disheartened to offer resistance to disappointment of troop general be able to take with only limited force for difficulty of carriage be enormous a experience have shown that country be likely to be deserted devastated on approach be therefore impossible for bulk of army to be taken on by land there be other point however where troop left behind must be profitably employed capture of important town of bassein on main branch of irrawaddy must open river to passage of ship put entire stop to trade of force told off for advance against donabew be divided into two column first strong consisting of th st th regiment three native battalion troop of bodyguard battery of bengal horse artillery part of rocket company be to march by land second column be to proceed by water be strong consisted of

branch of river here be to be joined by general cotton force after capture of donabew then unless court of ava sued for peace united advance be to be made on important town of prome chapter donabew stanley brooke did not accompany land column a general said to two day before have be speaking with general cotton said that must be glad if must attach to staff until force unites again not one of staff officer speaks burmese although have two three interpreter with will be better if bandoola sends in officer offering to surrender that must be met by british officer in next place may be necessary for to communicate with assuredly with experience of country must be able to get through better than anyone else apprehend that there must be great danger for know available fighting man have be impressed by bandoola passage of column will completely cow villager lying between river suppose said with smile that have objection since will save long have doubt very unpleasant march will also obtain view of affair at stockade at pellang donabew land column started on th of february water column on th detachment for bassein sailed on following day stanley be delighted at being appointed to accompany boat column march through country must present novelty to be probable that land column must encounter serious resistance until after being joined by general cotton force advanced against prome horse went with of general cotton staff under charge of syce meinik one steamboat kept at start in rear of great flotilla of boat so that in case of of striking on sandbank must at once move to assistance pull off scene be very bright one a in upwards of hundred craft of various size proceeded together in front be dozen gunboat next to came two sloop of war followed by rest of boat proceeding in irregular order there be very little stream for river be now quite low although flat country be still little more than swamp rain in hill supplied main body of water to have long since ceased ship boat be of course rowed by blue jacket other craft be for most part manned by native though soldier on board occasionally lent hand two day after starting boat destroyed three newly erected stockade be found unoccupied on th reached pellang where three very strong stockade have be erected battery be thrown up next day from a well a from steamboat sloop of war shell be thrown into stockade with such effect that two of enemy work be evacuated a soon a troop took offensive main pellang stockade be also abandoned without resistance two smaller work be destroyed portion of th madras infantry be left here to maintain communication with rangoon on th flotilla entered main stream next day advance came in sight of donabew be five day before whole force be in position for several of most heavily laden craft stuck fast on sandbank at fork of river next day donabew be summoned to surrender bandoola who be at head of men returned refusal be given in courteous term differing very widely from haughty peremptory language in previous communication have be couched next day party of th landed on low lying ground between main stockade river in spite of heavy fire succeeded in ascertaining strength nature of defence main work be in form of parallelogram about mile long stood on ground rising above general level fifty piece of cannon of various size be in position on river face two outwork constructed of square beam of timber with outer ditch thick abbatis defended southern face against attack from enemy landing below be necessary to leave strong guard on board flotilla lest attack must be made by war canoe fire raft general therefore have not more than men available for assault a enemy gun completely commanded river be necessary to land below on morning of th troop be disembarked with two six pounder gun rocket detachment forming in two column advanced against lower of two covering stockade after exchange of fire with enemy rushed forward forced entrance into although enemy resisted with more resolution than have for time shown prisoner be taken rest of defender fled to second work two more gun four mortar be landed placed in position after stockade have be shelled for short time storming party under captain rose advanced to assault so heavy fire be opened upon that little column be brought to standstill forced to fall back with loss of commander of captain cannon of th while most of seaman with storming party be either killed wounded want of success against mere outwork showed general cotton that with small force at disposal must be worse than useless to renew attack for be outwork carried loss must be so great that must be hopeless to think of attacking bandoola main position therefore determined to abstain from further attack until reinforced now mr brooke said a soon a troop have be taken on board boat again must bring service into requisition be just contingency that thought might possibly occur can not advance up river until donabew be taken can not attack place with force at command therefore will at once write despatch to general campbell for to carry will be accompanied by two men of bodyguard who have come with a orderly will have use for here three of together need not fear molestation from few people remaining in village may be able to cut way through of band of deserter beaten troop dispersed over country very well general will also take burman on second charger may be useful in getting news a to road from native who will a likely a not fly into jungle when see approaching however there be not much fear of losing way a will be along river a far a tharawa boat be at once sent off to craft carrying two orderly horse of staff a soon a despatch be written stanley after shaking hand with companion be also rowed to horse barge be at signal of general taken in tow by steamer piloted to opposite bank boat sounding ahead presently found spot where there be enough water for barge to get alongside bank horse be led ashore stanley two trooper meinik mounted burmese be poor rider during wet season stanley have often taken meinik on spare horse when riding about in camp partly because must trust to look after horse carefully in second place to accustom to ride on horseback so a to act if required a orderly meinik be quite of opinion that there must be risk whatever in passing through village thought probable that might fall in with disbanded troop a be known that land column have soon after starting captured fort of mophi that garrison between two three thousand strong have taken to jungle dispersed still master said think likely that will attack will be expecting one will come upon by surprise then will run into bush thinking that must have many more troop behind no be not likely that will have many gun must throw away when fled partly to run faster through forest partly because most of will be making off to village hoping to lie concealed until war be over while if have gun in hand must be known that be deserter might be seized sent across river to bandoola up to prome rode fifteen mile before dark then took up quarter in village few old men woman child inhabiting fled at approach when meinik went to edge of jungle shouted out loudly that need not fear for harm must be done to of good price must be given for food two three returned finding statement to be true one of went into jungle again brought others back fowl egg be brought into hut stanley occupied good supply of grain for horse be also purchased thus stanley be able to avoid breaking into small stock of provision have brought with inhabitant of part of burma be tribe known a carians be tiller of soil be industrious hardy race country be so rich that not only raised sufficient for own want sent large supply of grain rice to ava be very heavily taxed a rule be exempt from conscription nevertheless have on present occasion be forced to labour at stockade in transporting food for troop forest village be small consisted of little hut erected either in tree shorn of branch upon very strong pole abode be only accessible by rough ladder formed by nailing piece of wood across tree pole be absolutely necessary on account of number of tiger infested forest village where have halted be however built upon ground be surrounded by strong stockade people assured stanley that none of fugitive from mophi have come that way there have said be many after bandoola defeat have seen none of late declared that have far greater fear of than have of english for plundered wherever went if must not obtain enough to satisfy expectation burnt house often killed many of inhabitant villager volunteered to keep watch night at gate of stockade although said that there be fear of anyone approaching a stranger must not find way through forest in dark even must do so fear of tiger must prevent from making attempt stanley agreed to pay of to watch also stationed one of own men a sentry relieving three hour hour after reached village saw one of war boat rowing rapidly up stream have doubt that be bearing message from bandoola saying that have repulsed attack of british beyond hearing howling of tiger in forest stanley passed night undisturbed except when went to change sentry meinik took share of watching stanley relieved hour before daybreak by time sun rose horse have be fed breakfast taken after riding mile country became more open cultivated field succeeded dense forest ground be higher little group of hut must be seen wherever small elevation rose above general level change be very welcome for be able to travel faster there be le chance of coming suddenly upon party of disbanded troop presently just a reached larger village than usual by river bank thick smoke arose from one of house must hear female scream come on stanley shouted to three men riding behind see that pistol be ready to hand draw sword illustration stanley cut down man who be about to fire hut village be not like last stockaded being mile away from forest a dashed into saw twenty burmese two woman lay dead in front of one house one of men with torch be about to fire absorbed in own doings burmese did not notice coming of horseman until latter be close to then with cry of consternation turned to fly be too late stanley cut down man who be about to fire hut others then fell upon burmans with sword pistol six of be killed rest be pursued dashing down to river plunged in pistol shot being sent after stanley remained on bank until saw that have fairly started to cross river then re entered village two three frightened people came out from hiding place when meinik shouted to that be safe have gone said need not fear being disturbed by again see there be six gun lying in road will find plenty of ammunition on fellow have fallen there be spear sword too of course can hing if number of fellow come if there be only two three woman ought to be able to dispose of now must ride on on third day arrived at tharawa found that sir campbell who have be assured by native bandoola have retreated have continued march day before place be so large that stanley thought unsafe for to sleep there rode on to little village two mile away here be received with great deference passage of troop day before having profoundly impressed villager after waiting three hour to rest horse again mounted riding night arrived in morning at yuadit village twenty six mile from tharawa found force on point of starting bad news hope mr brooke general said a rode up to be sorry to say sir that news be not good here be brigadier despatch be unfortunate indeed general said when have run eye over document mr tollemache please to ride along line say that column be not to get into motion until further order colonel adair other officer of staff have be on point of mounting when stanley rode up general called two three of senior officer to cotton can take donabew get past said here be despatch see have lost several officer good many men in assault on outlying work only be afraid that there be nothing for to do go back to assistance be afraid not sir colonel adair said supply be running short already see decided upon filling up cart at tharawa where made sure that must be met by boat country round here have be completely stripped must be very serious matter to endeavour to advance to prome without supply moreover might expect much more serious resistance than have bargained for news that bandoola have repulsed assailant may be sure that have be exaggerated into great victory will restore spirit of burmese be evident that must turn back finish off with bandoola before advance further order be accordingly sent to officer commanding various corp that column be to retrace step while passed through village stanley related in much greater detail than have be given in despatch event of attack nature of defence at donabew troop marched along with cheerful mien be of course annoyance to have to plod back along road have before traversed upon other hand there be general satisfaction that be after to take part in capture of bandoola last stronghold colonel adair rode on with little troop of cavalry be to push forward to tharawa be to offer reward to native there for boat brought in there be little doubt that many of fisherman have hauled up craft into clump of bush brush wood to prevent being requisitioned by bandoola although be not likely that large number must now be obtained yet even if dozen be found must be of assistance rest of force reached tharawa on following evening with exception of party left to protect slow moving waggon found that nine canoe have be obtained that considerable portion of scanty population have be day employed in cutting bamboo timber for raft next morning troop be engaged on same work in construction of raft at three hundred men of th be taken across river to town of henzada in case bandoola on hearing of preparation for crossing must send force to oppose passage took four day continuous labour to get little army across a be necessary to make large timber raft to carry cart horse bullock gun store hearing that force be posted fifteen mile away to intercept detachment be marching from bassein colonel godwin with party be sent off night to endeavour to surprise burmese however took alarm before be attacked scattered in direction without firing shot army marched along right bank arrived before donabew on th of march communication be opened with general cotton force below town division set to work to erect battery burmese made several sortie to interrupt work one of be accompanied by bandoola seventeen elephant troop of cavalry horse artillery rocket company charged close up to elephant opened fire upon howdah filled with troop that carried in short time most of driver be killed elephant many of also have received wound dashed off into jungle while infantry fled back into stockade into discharge of shell rocket be maintained day next morning st of april mortar battery be completed others armed with light gun kept up continuous fire into enemy camp at daybreak on nd heavy gun of breaching battery also opened fire in very short time enemy be seen pouring out in rear of work making way into jungle a there have be no idea that must so speedily evacuate stockade preparation have be made for cutting off garrison therefore effected escape with little loss troop at once occupied work found large store of grain ammunition there a well a great number of gun from of wounded burmans be ascertained that evacuation of fort be due to death of bandoola who have be killed by explosion of shell while watching operation from lookout have be erected for at top of lofty tree death have caused most profound depression among garrison leader in vain endeavoured to reanimate courage opening of fire with heavy gun completed discomfiture fled without thought of resistance indeed greater part have stolen away during night portion of fleet have already passed up beyond fort under heavy fire rest now came up supply of grain be renewed guard being left to hold work must now serve a base army again started up river water column proceeding to tharawa land force marching back to henzada whence be carried across river in boat here force be joined by reserve column from rangoon consisting of several company of royal th native infantry with supply of elephant carriage cattle have arrived from calcutta on th yuadit be again reached opposition be encountered indeed whole country be deserted inhabitant having be ordered away by burmese authority a soon a fall of donabew be known when within four day march of prome two native official came in with communication to effect that burmese be ready to treat for peace a be known however that reinforcement be on way down from ava be evident that be merely pretext to gain time general sent word that when arrived at prome must be ready to open negotiation for peace country through army be now passing be very beautiful in far distance on left mountain of aracan must be seen while on right country be undulating richly cultivated broken by clump of timber with background of range of hill running along near pegu river on th height of prome eight mile away be visible flotilla must be seen lying at short distance below town messenger came out that afternoon to endeavour to induce general not to enter reply be sent that be out of question that harm must befall inhabitant that a soon a entered general must be ready to receive person qualified to treat for peace hour before daybreak army marched forward by sunrise be close to town position be found to be extremely strong hill commanding place have be fortified to very summit strong stockade ran in direction be evident that great number of men must have be engaged for long time in attempting to render place impregnable not soldier however be to be found native of place presently met with news that governor troop have evacuated with exception of small party who be firing town story be corroborated by wreath of smoke rising at various point troop pressed forward at top of speed on entering town found that native population have be forced to leave piling arm set to work to extinguish flame did not however succeed in doing until nearly town be destroyed fortunately fire be checked before reached great magazine of grain other store for army belief that negotiation have be only pretext to arrest advance of troop against town until expected reinforcement arrived be confirmed by native who presently came in from hiding place where have taken refuge until army retired said that a soon a news came of fall of donabew fresh levy be ordered to be collected in part of upper burma while whole population of province have be employed in adding to defence of town have be already very strongly stockaded be disappointment to force have hoped that occupation of prome must bring about submission of court of ava enable to be taken down river in boat embark before rainy season again set in prospect of passing that season at prome be vastly more pleasant than if have to be spent at rangoon be now inland beyond point where rain be continuous town be situated on high ground country round be open healthy although for little distance round cattle have be driven off village destroyed be certain that flying column must be able to bring in amount of cattle before wet season began for short time be thought that occupation of prome must show king court that be useless to continue struggle longer hope be dissipated when be known that further levy of men have be called out court however be apparently conscious that command must no longer be obeyed with alacrity before manifested early levy have obeyed call with cheerfulness believing in invincibility confident that must return home laden with spoil after driving without difficulty audacious stranger into sea thing however have not turned out so troop have left ava in high spirit have be routed with very heavy loss great general bandoola have be killed fugitive from army be scattered over land bearing with report of extraordinary fighting power of white enemy of hopelessness of attempting to resist consequence be that in issuing order for new levy bounty of twenty pound to burmans be very large sum be offered to man who obeyed call first step on part of british general be to send proclamation through country guaranteeing protection to inviting population to return to town village troop be employed in erecting with assistance of a much native labour a must be procured comfortable hut outside town so that native on returning must find home unoccupied untouched be not long before excellent policy have due effect a soon a who first returned sent news to friend fugitive came out from hiding place in forest in great number returned to city whose home be still standing settled down in resumed ordinary avocation just a if native ruler be still in authority while whose house have be burned set to work with cheerfulness characteristic of race to re erect light wooden dwelling so favourable be report spread through country of conduct that in short time population of prome be considerably larger than have be before advance of army similar result be speedily manifest throughout whole district below town from great forest covered more than half of villager poured out driving before herd of cattle in two three month country have appeared desert became filled with industrious population order be established local civil officer be again appointed to former post power of oppression intimidation be abrogated by order that punishment beyond short term of imprisonment be to be inflicted on person until case have be brought before british authority soon only fear entertained by people of rich district of lower irrawaddy be that british troop must march away leave again to oppression tyranny of former master market of prome be abundantly supplied with food of sort a everything be liberally paid for number of bullock be obtainable for although burmese be forbidden by religion to kill cattle therefore keep only for draught purpose have objection to killing indeed to eat meat when must obtain labour of kind be abundant great number of canoe be constructed for purpose of bringing up supply from village on river for advance of force at end of wet season until set in in earnest small body of troop marched through forest driving out band infested plundered killed country people without mercy general aide de camp have busy time of being constantly employed in carrying order to town village in hearing complaint in stanley case entering into agreement for purchase of cattle grain when in prome spent good deal of spare time with cousin who having bought horse frequently obtained leave to accompany on excursion on duty warm friendship have sprung up between harry be two year older than stanley have be at eton up to time that entered army be however in manner older than cousin whose work for three year previous to outbreak of war have rendered graver more manly than life spent among lad of own age must have done meinik always accompanied stanley wherever went have now to latter quiet amusement modified burmese costume making look like of of white indeed must have passed without notice a one of goa portuguese mess waiter in suit of white nankeen when riding on service away from headquarter camp be dressed in suit of tough brown khaki have obtained from one of trader at rangoon coat differed little from of suit stanley have handed over to except that be somewhat shorter without small shoulder cape in fact resembled closely modern regimental tunic below wore knee breech of same material with putty long band of cloth wound round round leg possessed many advantage over gaiter still clung to turban instead of being white be of same colour a clothes be much larger than burmese turban burmese be great fool often said to stanley think know great deal know nothing at think be great fighter be good at fighting for one englishman beat ten of government be good keep everyone very poor miserable come here know nothing of country yet make everyone comfortable ride through village see everyone rejoicing that be governed by english hoping that english will never go away again what do think sir will stay here always have have much trouble to take country great many people have be ill great many died now have got why must go away again be quite certain that will not give up meinik have be a say troublesome very expensive business farther king obliges to go up before make peace more will have to pay in money territory of course can not say what term of peace will be must think that very likely will hold country from sea up to here with aracan strip along sea coast of tenasserim will be good meinik said will never go outside english land again there will be plenty to do great trade on river everyone will be happy contented must be fool to go back to upper burma where must chop off head if knew that have be down to rangoon when english be there chapter harry carried off early in september stanley be sent to purchase cattle from of village near foot of hill at same time to make inquiry a to movement of large band of marauder who have be making raid in neighbourhood have with four trooper of bodyguard harry brooke accompanied although from healthier situation of prome amount of illness during wet season did not approach that have be suffered at rangoon great many men be in hospital there be many death harry have have sharp attack of fever a have now recovered to certain extent medical officer of regiment strongly recommended that must have change therefore without difficulty obtained colonel leave to accompany stanley a ground must be much higher than on river mere fact of getting away from camp where so many death took place day must in be of great value stanley daily journey be not likely to be long one a have instruction to stop at village to see how thing be going on whether people have complaint to make of oppression exaction by local authority be tremendous pull being able to speak language stanley harry said if have be for must have be stuck at prome like rest of instead of that be always about look a fresh healthy a if be at hill station in india yes have be immense advantage to in way of course must never have got staff appointment if have not be for by way have not told that while be down with fever gazette containing confirmation of appointment by general notice of commission dated on day of appointment came out have quite lump sum to draw for although have be paid a interpreter all along paymaster made difficulty about pay a subaltern until be gazetted regularly so have quite large sum coming to on pay allowance know how stand for cash if be short at can let have anything that want have got really more than know what to do with stanley bought uncommonly good native horse a know six week ago be going to ride for first time now really be almost first penny have spent since left rangoon there be nothing to buy here except food of course be mess business have idea that be rich country so far one have seen nothing in way of rich dress material shawl carpet jewelry that one must send home a present why in india be always being tempted here be certainly useful rather than ornamental meet eye saw nice thing at ava of course upper class bolted a came up country trader in rich good did same be going to take servant with harry think that there be occasion to do so for meinik can look after well enough yes be thinking of taking native man hired just after got here be very good fellow made very useful while be ill picked up tat for yesterday for few rupee know that man must do very well for sometimes when make village headquarters ride to visit others from may not feel well enough to go with then must come in very handy for have picked up good many word of english man be getting on very well that way yes be time before began for of course have occasion for now that have taken to what considers english costume have made up mind that will never settle down again under burmese government have be trying hard to pick up language found that be rather nuisance at first when instead of telling what be wanted in own language have to tell in english then translate for however doe understand good deal now whenever have nothing else to do be talking with soldier of course from riding about so much with be pretty well known now a be good tempered merry fellow make at home with if campaign last six month think will speak very fair english fancy that will have to make up mind that be permanency stanley be sure intends to follow wherever go whether be to england india anywhere else sha' be sorry for harry certainly not a long a be out here in first place be really very handy fellow ready to make useful in way then there be doubt that be greatly attached to must go through fire water for man of sort be invaluable to anyone knocking about a will be when war be over take up trading again only fault be that be really too anxious to do thing for of course when be on duty there be nothing much can do if be sitting in room will squat for hour in corner watch if cheroot get low there be with fresh one light in moment if drop handkerchief pen there be with before have time to stoop sometimes have really to invent errand to send on so a to give something to do for own have not contemplated what position must occupy if go trading quite recognize that will go with that must become portion of establishment even if establishment consisted only of will be ready to start at four in morning sun be tremendously hot now on day between rain at rate will be much better for till get strength to travel in cool of morning in evening will be ready will be round here with servant by hour by way what will bring with nothing at will take couple of chicken bread coffee sugar bottle of brandy for emergency will have difficulty in getting food in village trooper will only carry day ration with after always act a mess caterer charge expense when get back here accordingly next morning started at four o'clock stanley insisted that harry must ride second horse for present a own having be six week without exercise fed very much better than have be accustomed to be in much too high spirit to be pleasant for invalid meinik therefore took harry latter rode beside cousin whose horse have have abundant exercise be well content to canter quietly along by side of companion by end of ten day harry have picked up of strength now reached village stanley decided to use a headquarters for few day while made excursion to other place within day ride be good place for halt standing a did at height on hill where air be much cooler at night than in flat country be surrounded by clearing of about hundred acre in extent planted with cacao tree pepper many kind of vegetable be delightful harry said a sat in front of hut have be cleared for looked over plain must be twenty degree cooler here than be at prome think will hing tomorrow stanley just sit here enjoy know be very lazy for be feeling quite again still after ten day riding do think that will be pleasant to have day rest do by mean stanley said think have better stay here for three day that will remain man be very good cook there be lack of food chicken have just now be excellent people have promised to bring in game tomorrow there be plenty of snake too lose good deal can assure by turning up nose at be just a good a eel a meinik cook stewed with blade of cinnamon hot pepper can not see that can be bit more objectionable to eat than eel indeed for anything one know eel may have be feasting on drowned man day before be caught while snake only take meal once week so then only small bird of kind dare say that be quite right stanley own that dish man turn out look tempting can not bring to try at rate a long a can get anything else to eat if knew that be case of snake nothing must try till then prefer sticking to bird beast next morning stanley rode off with two of escort meinik who declined altogether to be left behind master said there be never saying when may want what must ever say to myself if misfortune be to come to be not to be there stanley have long day work a rule villager have few complaint to make at place went to on occasion headman have be behaving a in old time stanley have to listen to long series of complaint on behalf of villager case be fully proved a to extortion ill treatment stanley at once deprived man of office called upon villager to assemble elect in place if be not satisfied said to fellow can go to prome appeal to general there warn that if do must give notice to villager of intention so that may if choose send two three of number to repeat evidence that have given have noted fully down can tell that general when read will be much more likely to order sound flogging than to reinstate in office be dusk when stanley arrived within two mile of village where have left harry meinik who be riding just behind brought horse up alongside do see that sir there be light in sky be just over where village be be afraid there be fire there be right meinik hope nothing have gone wrong touched horse with heel rode on at gallop became more more anxious a approached village flame must be seen leaping up there be dull glow in sky a rode into clearing reined up horse in dismay number of glowing ember alone marked place where village have stood figure be to be seen moving about there have be foul play meinik get ready for action men said to two trooper dashed forward at gallop two three little group of people be sitting in attitude of deep dejection by remains of house what have happened stanley shouted a rode up robber have be here have slain many burned village where be friend have carried off lord at least can not find body servant one of soldier be lying dead of other soldier officer there be sign be terrible stanley exclaimed tell exactly how happened be four hour ago lord robber came suddenly out from plantation fell upon people many killed at once many also have escaped a did by running in among plantation so into forest heard firing of gun for little time then everything be silent knew that robber be searching house hour later smoke rose in many place then flame then after time be quiet boy crept up among bush came back with news that have gone then came out again twenty three of people have be killed eight carried off at least can not find body white officer one of soldier have gone also way did go track show that went up hill most likely will have gone to toungoo if have gone to town at indeed think have taken prisoner to get reward for stanley have thrown off horse a rode up stood for time silently leaning against then said to meinik picket horse then come have talk with then turned to two trooper there be nothing to be done now said have better look about see what can find in way of food then get grave dug for comrade for mr brooke servant two mahommedan trooper saluted led horse away meinik after picketing animal returned to stanley seeing that latter be pacing up down evidently not disposed to speak went away there be good many fowl walking about in bewildered way near hut have be away a usual searching for food in plantation field when robber band arrived on return home at dusk have found everything changed boy at once caught killed two of plucked brought to meinik who getting ember from fire cut fowl in two put on to roast few minute sufficed to cook a soon a be ready meinik took to stanley must eat master said have have nothing since started morning sorrow alone make poor supper will want to do something know will need strength be right meinik yes give one of take other one while eat can talk of course must make effort to rescue cousin from hand of band yes master knew that must do did ask how many there be of meinik say forty say sixty if knew where be now must come up to might manage to get off while robber be asleep meinik shook head be sure to keep strict guard over white officer said if rushed in shouted fired pistol might run away be afraid not meinik there might be scare for minute directly saw that there be only two of must turn kill people be brave enough may feel that can not stand against troop owing to discipline fight bravely hand to hand however know exactly way have gone must be hopeless to search for in forest during darkness what must go to toungoo for have be thinking over master seems to that many of may belong there to village near may not dare return to home because be afraid that must be punished for having left army must certainly be sent off again to now may think that if go back with white officer soldier tell story of having beaten great many english will be rewarded may even be able to remain time in home before be sent off may be ordered to march with prisoner to ava where must get still more reward can see other reason for carrying off officer think very likely that be so meinik anyhow be more likely to rescue cousin at toungoo than must be while on road must be next to impossible to find among hill tree even if did come upon at night must creep into midst of might find that cousin be too severely wounded to travel for a there be fight be almost certain must have be wounded before be captured therefore think be best to make straight for toungoo how many mile be from here do think meinik went over to native asked question about forty five mile say very bad travelling mountain ten mile to north be road run straight there then have better follow meinik in broken country forest must be losing way continually how will go master on horse foot will go on horseback a far a can be not likely to meet people travelling along road at present thing be that if can get horse a near town a possible must be very useful for if mr brooke have be wounded badly may not be able to walk far know whether country near town be open whether forest approach closely native be again applied to be rich country there say well cultivated for five six mile round town will go have talk with presently will of course be necessary for to disguise again meinik nodded yes must do that master do think that can get two three men to go with from here if will pay master doubt will be ready to go be well content with white ruler find that be not oppressed everything be paid for that white officer treat kindly well have lost many thing in affair today must be glad to earn little money how many must like to have four five meinik exactly know at present what there must be for to do must help to make fire keep watch while be doing something at rate may be useful of course will get trooper out too if can very likely will be confined together if rescue one can of course rescue other now must do writing get torch of sort will do while be speaking to native stanley always carried notebook pen ink to take down statement complaint a rode about now sat down wrote account of what have taken place during absence have previous news of existence of band went on native have certainly no fear of attack being imminent have thought that there be slightest risk must not have made village headquarters have left mr brooke there with only servant two trooper regret matter most deeply be about to set off to toungoo with man will of course go in disguise will make endeavour to free cousin trust general that will grant leave for purpose be of course unable to say how long may take however long will persevere until learn that cousin be dead until be killed trust that in starting at once on assumption that will grant leave be not committing breach of duty if so feel that can not under circumstance in be placed grant leave to officer to be absent on private business inclose formal resignation of commission stating why feel constrained even in presence of enemy to endeavour to rescue cousin from band have carried off at rate must not be said resigned in order to shirk danger sent off two day ago by one of native here report of proceeding up

started on horseback descended hill to plain at foot turning to right rode for ten twelve mile when struck into road following at easy pace came in course of hour upon party of villager sitting by roadside sun be just rising travelled for three hour without meeting anyone then drew off into wood at point where small stream crossed road after eating meal giving good feed to horse lay down to sleep till heat of day abated native who be armed with spear sword keeping watch by turn at four o'clock started again at ten approached spot where in depth of wood lay temple man who knew position declared however that must not find at night stanley have doubt that be really afraid to go there a did not wish to press against will said carelessly that made difference if halted there close by road fire being speedily lit bivouacked round meinik have procured necessary dye from village stanley be again stained covered with tattoo mark a before what be to do about hair master asked will never do for to go like stanley have not thought of point for time be completely at loss own hair be now short must not possibly be turned up only thing can see said after long pause be for men to cut off lock of hair from top of head where will not show six lock must be ample see how be to fasten below turban there be berry can get wax from meinik said boil in water wax float at top with master must fasten hair in among yours so that must look right men have laughed at proposal willingly consented to part with portion of hair meinik therefore proceeded to stain stanley close crop black first thing in morning boy went out soon returning with quantity of berry water be poured over in earthenware pot placed over fire in hour thick scum of oil gathered on surface meinik skimmed off a fast a formed a cooled solidified into tenacious mass somewhat resembling cobbler wax six lock of hair have already be cut off end be smeared with wax worked in among stanley own hair then little of hot wax be rubbed in men declared that one must notice anything peculiar in appearance long tress be curled round at top of head ring of muslin tied round burmans be immensely amused at transformation have be wrought in stanley appearance followed through wood to temple without sign of nervousness ruin be extensive considerable portion of building have be hewn out of face of precipitous rock in manner of hindoo temple be evident that have be work of people more closely allied to indian race than to tartar chinese people from whom burmese sprung uncouth figure be sculptured on wall at burmese looked with awe a stanley laughed joked over soon recovered usual demeanour be great deal more afraid of tiger than of ghost stanley said deserted place like be just sort of spot must be likely to be in at rate if cave go further into hill there be sign of doing so may be hoped that tiger have superstition about too at rate will be good thing to pile great quantity of firewood at entrance think one of have better stay here with boy horse must be great deal safer here with fire burning than must be in wood where tiger might pounce upon at moment a to folly about spirit be only old woman chatter burmese talked among one of men finally agreed to stay with boy hour be spent in gathering pile of brushwood log man said that two boy must gather plenty more during day be at four o'clock to take horse down to river mile distant let drink fill have brought with large bag of grain have be carried by men quantity of plantain fowl therefore party be to remain must be well provided moreover in collecting wood score of snake have be killed of chicken have be cooking while be at work a soon a be eaten started for town when came within mile of stanley entered plantation of fruit tree meinik four men went on returned in two hour with news that party of ten men have arrived in town on previous day with two prisoner one coloured man have be able to walk other white man have be carried in on litter have be lodged in jail by time conduct of english towards native at rangoon territory occupied have have one good effect signally a have be defeated by burmese have lost individual hatred of stranger knew that wounded prisoner always received kind treatment at hand although court of ava remained a arrogant bigoted a ever people in lower burma have learned to respect invader few prisoner have taken received much better treatment than who have be captured at commencement of war a soon a be dusk stanley went with meinik into town be place of considerable size with building at least equal to at prome toungoo have formed part of kingdom of pegu before have be subdued by burmese peculiar characteristic facial outline of latter be here much le strongly marked in many case entirely absent so stanley felt that even in daylight must pas without attracting attention prison be surrounded by strong high bamboo fence in space inclosed by be eight ten dwelling of usual wooden construction dozen armed men be seated by fire in yard two sentry be carelessly leaning against gate there must be difficulty in getting in there with two rope ladder one to climb up with one to drop on other side stanley said may be sure that most of guard go to sleep at night first thing to ascertain be house prisoner be kept in in second place how cousin be going on can hing until be able to walk for short distance let move round to other side of inclosure may be that sentry be posted at door on getting to other side looking through crevice between bamboo must make out two figure squatted by door of one of house have doubt that be one in harry brooke be confined now meinik first thing be for to go buy rope when place get quite quiet will make loop throw over top of palisade behind hut then will climb up let down inside then crawl up to hut see what be going on there if cousin be alone will endeavour to speak to of course there may be guard inside a well a at door if be very ill there will probably be light let go master meinik must rather go will be able to judge how be if can catch sight of chapter preparing rescue stanley remained where be until meinik returned in hour with rope stanley made loop at one end then knotted at distance of about foot apart to enable to climb more easily then waited until guard fire burnt down low most of men went off into hut few yard distant three only remaining talking before fire then stanley moved round to other side of palisade choosing spot immediately behind hut where sentry be posted threw up rope needed many attempt before loop caught at top of one of bamboo a soon a did so climbed up found that position be exceedingly unpleasant one bamboo be so cut that of terminated in three spike so impossible be to cross that have to slip down rope again on telling meinik what be matter latter at once took off garment folded up into roll two foot long if lay that on top master will be able to cross time stanley have little difficulty on reaching top laid roll on bamboo spike be able to raise on to sit there while pulled up rope dropped on inside descending at once began to crawl towards hut a have seen before climbing light be burning within window be at back of house be twenty yard from palisade when reached stood up cautiously looked in indian trooper be seated in chair asleep without tunic one arm be bandaged blood stained be wrapped round head on bamboo pallet with dark rug thrown over be figure lamp on wall gave too feeble light for stanley to be able to make out whether figure lying there be harry have doubt that be so in low tone said in hindustani wake up man soldier moved little stanley repeated word in somewhat louder tone trooper sprang to foot looked round in bewildered way come to window stanley said be officer man glance turned to window surprised at seeing burmese peasant a supposed instead of officer stood hesitating come on stanley said be lieutenant brooke soldier recognized voice drew up made military salute then stepped to window have come stanley said to try rescue lieutenant brooke have friend without how be be very ill sir be badly wounded be unconscious sometimes lie for hour without moving sometimes talk to a can not understand language know not what say sometimes certainly call upon us name often do what can for be very little bathe forehead with water pour between lip of course can eat nothing keep water rice be boiled in when be cool give to drink there be strength in then nothing can be done at present stanley said tomorrow night will bring fruit can squeeze juice of lime into little water give to there be nothing better for fever a soon a be well enough for to get through palisade will have litter ready for carry off nothing can be done until then how be treated give plenty of rice sahib be at liberty to go out into courtyard in daytime now that know that be near will have fear have be expecting that must send to ava where doubt must kill have thought most that if be to send away from here there be one to look after sahib must surely die at moment stanley felt hand roughly placed on shoulder turning round struck out with strength full in man face fell like log if ask who be here said hastily to trooper say that know not who be burmese came spoke to of course thought that be one of guard then ran to rope climbed up a got over pulled up threw down to meinik a thought that there might be difficulty in shaking off from bamboo then dropped to ground bringing down pad with did kill master meinik asked a hurried away be watching window saw talking to someone inside then saw man suddenly come into light put hand upon saw turn round fell without sound being heard there be fear of being killed meinik simply hit hard went down have doubt stunned be unfortunate though may set extra guard for time think will not believe man story at rate will suppose that be only one of guard who not being able to sleep wandered round there looked into hut from behind worst of be that be afraid that there be chance of being able to take cousin lime other fruit tomorrow night a said must be very ill quite unconscious be very bad master will try take in fruit tomorrow if wo let in will watch outside gate when one of guard come out will take aside have doubt that for small bribe will carry in fruit give to trooper wonder that put into hut with window at back suppose must have done so if cousin have not be so ill that be evident that must not for time attempt to escape joined villager outside town telling that there be nothing to do night returned to temple found man two boy sitting by great fire shivering with terror what be matter stanley asked spirit have be making sort of noise outside there be other noise at end of cave close to horse stanley took brand went over to be munching grain quietly well see horse be not frightened so may be sure that be noise heard there be nothing unnatural about be like question be not answered for at moment sound like loud deep sigh be heard overhead native started back even stanley felt for moment uncomfortable be only wind said there must be opening above there wind make noise in just a doe in chimney will see about in morning now a to noise outside be wailing cry man said pooh must have be tiger leopard perhaps only wild cat doubt smelt horse be too much afraid of fire to come nearer why must have heard tiger often enough to know cry thought that be tiger man said rather shamefacedly boy said be certain that be not be not sure one way other sitting down by fire stanley told men exact position of prisoner said that feared must be altogether impossible to get harry out for present must give anything to have here said must be impossible to get over palisade might cut through master meinik said with sharp saw must cut hole big enough in hour to carry litter out only thing be must not get bed through window might get over by making narrow litter stanley said lifting from bed on to difficulty must be what to do with when got out a to carrying distance in present state must be out of question besides guard be sure to be vigilant for considerable time think that best plan must be for to go back to village tomorrow taking horse with for one of to come over other day for order then there must be occasion for anyone to watch horse certainly will be of use to at present for will be week before cousin be strong enough to ride meinik will take up abode close to edge of forest for will save four five mile walk day first thing in morning will go with choose spot so that may both know where to find two of have got ax will make shelter in tree so a to be able to sleep without fear of tiger when go out there though dare say that will generally sleep near town however one other of will always be at spot at midday on day when be to meet now that think of two of may a well stay at shelter for present while other three two boy go home then there will be occasion to take long journey so often when do get cousin out will have to take up abode for time here in forest until be well enough to bear journey in morning stanley closely examined roof of cave must see opening to account for noise that have heard have however no doubt that one existed somewhere left man with two boy in charge of horse went with others until approached edge of forest kept along within tree for mile so that fire might light must be unseen by people travelling along road men considered precaution needle a declared that one must venture to pas along after partly owing to fear of tiger partly to vicinity of temple suitable tree be soon fixed on burmese now in element ascended by driving in peg at distance of two foot apart once among high branch lopped off small bough must be in way then descending cut number of pole many length of tough creeper with constructed platform among higher branch on erected sort of arbour amply sufficient to hold four five people lying down arbour must hardly be noticed even by person searching a be to great extent hidden by foliage beneath stanley told meinik that have better buy rope for ladder take out peg a might catch eye of passer by cause to make close search above a soon a work be finished two of men went back to temple to start at once for home with companion boy horse stanley have brought with pistol two horse blanket other thing might be useful when be stored above with meinik two men went towards town stopped a before short distance outside just a be dusk men returned carrying rope that meinik have bought store of food with be sent to shelter stanley entered town where met meinik have sent in fruit latter said have difficulty about told first soldier who came out after have bought came from village where white officer have be captured by bandit have be very kind to a knew that have be carried off badly wounded have come over to get fruit for found that must not let in at gate said must give ounce of silver to if must hand thing to prisoner for said at once that must do so have heard that white always treated wounded prisoner very well that there must be difficulty about for that there be window at back of hut where be lying must easily pas thing in there without anyone noticing if prisoner be a said good man be only right that must be helped told must look out for might want to do same day think that be honest fellow might have passed fruit in even without reward still everyone be glad to earn little money told that strange thing have happened last night one of comrade have declared that have found giant standing at window where prisoner be put hand upon when be struck down by lightning one must have believed tale at if have not be that nose be broken other prisoner have be questioned a did not understand burmese must learn nothing from two guard be in future to be placed at back of house a well a in front that part of business be bad meinik dare say will be able to bribe master may be sure that most of be eager to get back to own village for few ounce of silver must be glad enough to help then to make escape go off to home man saw today might find one among ready to do so with especially if home happened to be on other side of hill there must then be chance of being seized sent back again by headman sentry must only have to let know what night must arrange for to be on guard together behind hut then must be able to manage well must be capital plan meinik if must be arranged well be great comfort to know that fruit have got in safely lime especially will be great help to cousin next time see man must try get to find out how be going on for fortnight stanley remained in forest meinik met soldier other day sent in fruit at end of ten day heard that prisoner have recovered sens be said that a soon a be well enough to move be to be sent to ava now have better begin to sound man a to willingness to aid to escape have very little doubt about master for have already learned that home be on other side of hill went down with bandoola returned after defeat with number of others travelling up bank of pegu river if have not have military chief with must have started straight for home be marched here have be kept on duty in town ever since have heard how well off people be on other side of hill under english rule so feel sure that will be glad to escape if see chance of getting off be good in first place let know that other english officer who be at village with one captured have said that must be ready to pay well anyone who must aid in escape if say that must willingly do so if also must get away tell that one man must be of use that if must get to join so that must go on guard together behind house must be managed say that in first place must myself speak to white officer learn exactly how be whether can endure journey a far a tree temple whichever may decide upon a best when have seen will send for other men from village be in hurry to get away for longer stay quiet better at moment governor may decide that be sufficiently recovered to be carried may send off to ava under strong escort therefore although will put off moving a long a possible must not run risk of being sent away four day later meinik said that man have arranged with to join that must be on duty behind hut that evening between nine midnight accordingly at ten o'clock stanley arrived with meinik two villager at palisade meinik have insisted upon accompanying to hut believe that man be to be trusted master indeed be sure be know second man may have pretended to accept offer only on purpose to betray comrade to obtain honour reward for preventing escape of white man therefore must be with in case be attacked other two men may be useful to give alarm if party be sent round to cut off stanley who have brought horse blanket with to lay on top of palisade be first to drop into inclosure meinik followed closely nothing have be said to guard a to white officer of whom meinik have spoken being of party stanley have purposely left pistol behind lest must be tempted to use in case be attacked carried spear long burmese knife meinik have begged to be allowed to go forward first while stanley remained by rope pointed out that change might possibly have be made that other men might have be placed on sentry know master said if got there found two stranger attacked must fight then must give alarm others must come up before must cross palisade will steal up when be close will make noise like hiss of snake if men be there will repeat sound if be not one come forward to look for kill snake will slay before have time to utter sound if other run forward at sound of fall will kill also if alarm be given can come forward speak to cousin if there be alarm must climb rope will not know way have run will have plenty of time to get over palisade pull up rope then will think that guard have be killed by of comrade hope such misfortune will happen stanley said gravely for there must then be chance whatever of getting away must probably be moved to other place one hope must be that might rescue on road must be difficult matter indeed if be sent a certainly must be under strong escort however plan be doubt best for if be killed captured there must be end of chance of being rescued meinik crawled forward in minute two stanley heard low hissing sound followed by two others walked forward step two to meet meinik a came back be all right master can go on fearlessly meinik returned with to window posted outside standing in shadow while stanley stepped in through open casement indeed be provided only with shutter outside must ordinarily have be closed owing to illness of prisoner strong desire of governor that must live to be sent to ava have be opened to allow free passage of air trooper sprung from couch a stanley made slight sound before attempting to enter stanley said in hindustani silence be mr brooke trooper stared doubtfully at dark tattooed half naked figure be runkoor be disguised be like when spoke to through window fortnight since must not then see figure be awake harry asked in english a approached pallet yes be awake at least think so be really stanley be sure enough man stanley replied a pressed thin hand of invalid did not runkoor tell have be here before harry have broken down altogether surprise delight be too much for in weak state of course stanley went on quietly knew that must not speak english thought that might make sign did make sign time gave fruit said beahib brooke ' pointed outside waved arm about must not make head tail of what meant why must keep on repeating name time gave fruit be complete puzzle for a to sign that made seemed to that have gone off head have be too weak to think over so gave up worrying about never once struck that be who sent fruit what awful figure be never mind about harry have come in to see how strong be have bribed two guard stationed behind can just sit up in bed to take food stanley be must not walk step to save life did not expect to walk what want to know be whether be strong enough to be carried few mile on litter have five men from village where be can cut through palisading behind hut want to give a long time a possible be afraid that day governor may have taken out sent in litter to ava under strong escort must bear being carried out doubt if must not must think must do harm so long a wound break out afresh suppose worst must happen to must be must faint before got to end of journey be sure old man that be not dream quite certain if be well enough must give sharp pinch if be willing to venture will make preparation at once have to send to village in three day will be ready first night after that men manage to be on guard together behind will be here may be week may be more at rate worry about if take away suddenly will try to get out of hand somehow dear stanley harry said with feeble laugh do know that be spoiling chance of earldom may take that if succeed to title old fellow sha' for if go under will too now goodbye must be fatal be to be caught here try to get a strong a can let notice that be doing so without giving harry time to reply stanley pressed hand left bedside paused for minute to inform trooper of plan for escape then got through window meinik joined at once without word being spoken crossed palisade threw down rope blanket dropped after to ground on way back to tree stanley told two men that officer be better that next morning at daybreak one of must start for village to fetch three comrade boy be also to come back with a be big fellow carried spear might a stanley thought be useful in fight in assisting to carry harry on following morning after man have started stanley went with meinik to examine temple more closely than have done before thought that must be far better hiding place than hut in tree there must certainly be hot pursuit next day might be discovered whether in temple in tree in latter must be powerless to defend for burmese with ax must be able to fell in few minute whereas in temple stout defence might be made for time moreover rock chamber must be far cooler in middle of day than hut chief object in visiting temple be to find chamber with narrow entrance must be held by dozen men against number of foe be desirable if possible to find one so situated that might in case of necessity retreat into chamber into open air meinik be so confident in white man power to combat even evil spirit that approached temple with stanley without betraying nervousness have provided with torch of resinous wood meinik carried couple of brand from fire chamber have before be in be apparently largest in temple there be several other opening in rock be entrance will try first stanley said pointing to one ten foot from ground see there be once step leading up to doubt where be standing there be temple built against face of rock probably doorway led into one of priest chamber be necessary to pile three four block of stone on top of two step that alone remained intact in order to enable to reach entrance let light torch before go in meinik said there may be snake be hardly likely meinik see face of rock have be chiselled flat think snake must climb up to entrance perhaps not master be best to be ready for lighted two torch passed through doorway there be angry hiss distance away be snake sure enough meinik wonder how got here holding torch above head saw that chamber be fourteen foot wide twenty long in corner to left something be lying above dark object be moving backwards forward be big boa meinik said now master do take two torch in one hand have knife ready in other if coil round cut through at once be good place for fighting for there be nothing here for to get tail round boa can not squeeze very hard unless doe that stanley feeling that in combat of sort burman must be perfectly at home while knew nothing about did a be told determining to rush in must attack follower can advance straight towards master will steal round will be watching may get cut at before notice illustration great snake moved head higher higher hissing angrily stanley moved slowly forward a did so great snake moved head higher higher hissing angrily with eye fixed on torch stanley did not take gaze from advanced grasping knife knew that boa bite be harmless that be only embrace be to be feared be within eight foot of reptile when there be spring snake head disappeared in moment be writhing twisting lashing tail so quickly that eye must hardly follow contortion stand back master meinik shouted if tail strike might do injury be harmless otherwise have cut head off stanley stepped back pace two stood gazing in awe at tremendous writhing of headless snake be monster meinik said be big snake master indeed must say that must be about forty foot long be a thick a body must be more than match for tiger well hope there be not many more of about meinik that depends master may have mate be more likely there will be other must eat smaller one of own kind of course there may be small poisonous one about a writhing of snake ceased stanley looked round saw narrow doorway in corner opposite that in have be lying here be passage meinik let see where go to meinik have by time lighted two more torch more light better said when be looking for snake holding in one hand knife in other passed through doorway be about four foot high stanley followed apartment be similar to last narrower be lighted by opening not more than foot square see meinik there be staircase in corner facing step be very narrow in perfect preservation without staying to examine room meinik led way up examining step carefully holding knife in readiness to strike mounted forty step then entered room about ten foot square except window eighteen inch by three foot there be apparent exit from chamber must think that there must be way out of place meinik why must have taken trouble to cut long flight of step through rock just to reach miserable little chamber meinik shook head way of ancient builder be beyond there must be outlet somewhere if must find besides have not found where snake came in yet must have come in at door master small snake must not have climbed up that big fellow must rear head up come in quite easily have found little snake at well that may be so still think that there must be way out from here why must men go to labour of cutting long stair excavating chamber here without reason let look through window meinik be passage rather than window for rock face have be left four foot in thickness crawling out stanley saw that be fifty foot above foot of cliff yard below be ledge of rock two foot wide be level have deep groove cut at regular interval across have doubt that roof of outside temple have started from point that groove be made for end of massive rafter of teak stone at time passage to chamber that have left be doubtless used for exit on to flat roof stepping on to ledge called meinik to now meinik said will follow ledge there may be way up from walking with good deal of care stanley made way along to point where ledge stopped abruptly looking down saw remains of wall of solid masonry perceived that have be correct in surmise a to purpose of ledge then turned went back to other end of ledge few foot before reached meinik who be now leading way stopped here be passage master entrance be about same size a through have stepped out on to ledge instead of going straight in started upwards flight of step meinik be beginning to hope that will find way out at top if can do so will make safe must defend stair entrance for long time when wanted to get away must make quietly off without anyone knowing that have left chapter in temple went up flight of step for considerable distance then found passage blocked by number of great stone stanley uttered exclamation of disgust have fallen in said doubt be near top of rock staircase be roofed in there be building erected over entrance roof building whichever be have fallen in be very unlucky when go down will climb up hill see if can discover anything about with plenty of food water went on a descended into lowest chamber one must hold place for time yes master one must store away food where must store water might bring skin in must last for week perhaps two week after after must make way off somehow meinik stanley said confidently well there be doubt that be place to shelter in be le likely to find here than anywhere if do find can defend stoutly must say too that if think over ought to be able to hit upon plan for making noise must frighten know how scared man two boy be at sighing sound in other chamber certainly must make more alarming noise than meinik nodded that must master with reed of different size must make noise a deep a roar of tiger others like singing of bird then will certainly bring reed in here with meinik suppose will mind in daytime what sound hear at night think even officer must care to move about here if can make few noise understand well for present have done work here have best go off with burman to buy food to serve in case of siege have better go to of cultivator house near edge of wood for rice fruit if can get food there will be able to make two three journey day instead of one before start back will climb round to top of hill see what have happened to shut up staircase took quarter of hour climbing through forest undergrowth before reached upper edge of rock wall in chamber have be excavated have evidently in first place be natural cliff for when on ledge stanley have noticed that while below point rock be a smooth a built wall above be rough evidently untouched by hand of man following edge of cliff until standing a nearly a must guess above entrance to step walked back among tree at distance of thirty yard came upon ruin be built of massive stone like strewed ground where temple have stood great tree rose on one side be evident that growth have in first place overthrown wall at point climber shrub have thrust root in between block have be slightly moved by growth of tree have in time forced asunder so gradually whole building have collapsed tree must be very old one stanley said looking up at for be evident that wall be thrown down great many year ago very old master be one of hardest wood such tree live say five six hundred year there be be known to be even older than well be clear that staircase came up here have mean of knowing how far point reached be below must say that stone saw be remains of pavement roof for see great block formed wall go a far a middle where there be great depression still of course step may have come up on one side other not just in middle of little temple for doubt be temple now see reason for step up to little square room be explained probably three chamber be apartment of principal priest from must either go out on to roof of temple must by taking upper staircase to point leave enter without observation now let be off on arriving at tree shelter found that burman have got meal ready after partaking of meinik with man started to buy provision be fortunate that stanley have before starting from prome drawn twenty pound worth of silver from paymaster have expected to be away for three four week during time must have have to buy provision for harry four trooper might possibly have occasion for money for other matter have not paid men from village for knew that one of must willingly accompany to prome to receive payment for very small amount of silver sufficed for purchase of considerable quantity of food in burma fruit of many kind grew wild in wood be extremely cheap a be rice grain therefore a yet with exception of small sum expended in toungoo money be virtually untouched two burmans made three journey before returned time with large basket of fruit grain rice on following morning went into town bought six of largest sized water skin such a be carried for use of troop in india one on side of bullock a soon a returned with started for temple at stream about hundred yard from entrance partially filled one of skin placing strong bamboo through strap sewn on for purpose meinik burmans carried to temple with stanley assistance lifted into lower chamber others be one by one placed beside then water be carried in smaller skin poured in until be a full a must hold there be water enough to last for month if need be stanley said a after securely tying up mouth laid skin down side by side smaller mussucks be then filled placed with large skin then having done long day work returned to tree just a sun be setting four men two boy be already there having done sixty mile from village without halt have already cooked rice slice of venison meinik have brought with water skin from town that morning be now lying smoking cigar with placid contentment for next six day meinik went to town afternoon on return on last evening said that guard have told that governor have paid visit to prison day have seen white captive have decided that be now well enough to travel that in two day time be to start for court having sent down urgent order that must be carried there a soon a be well enough to bear fatigue then tomorrow must get out stanley said will two men be on duty yes master have not be on since last night be there will form second watch will go on guard at midnight have bought two very sharp saw have cut two strong bamboo for litter be constructed next day be very simple being formed by sewing blanket strongly to two bamboo two slighter bamboo four foot long be tied loosely to main pole be to be lashed across a soon a have got beyond palisade so a to keep pole three foot apart a blanket be four foot from pole to pole must allow to bag comfortably cross piece must not be attached until be beyond palisade for window be two foot wide be therefore proposed to make gap through palisade same width only late in evening entered town sat down in deserted corner until time came for to begin work at last meinik said that by star be already past midnight then proceeded to spot where have before climbed palisade here at once set to work saw be well oiled in very few minute five bamboo be cut away at level of ground six foot above a stockade be bound together by cross piece behind other portion of bamboo remained in place meinik stanley went first followed by three of burmans one of whom carried litter other two burmans with boy remained on guard at opening be barefooted except stanley wore pair of lightest leather sandal went noiselessly up to window guard a before responding to meinik hiss without word one after entered chamber trooper have be sitting at table evidently anxiously expecting arrival stanley went up to bed be better harry asked in whisper better still weak everything have be arranged beforehand litter be laid down on ground with pole a far apart a possible then stanley made sign to trooper to take one end of rug on harry be lying while took other burmans ranged on side blanket be lifted up with occupant pillow composed of clothes laid quietly on to blanket of litter then two burmans went outside while other four men lifted pole carried one end to window burmans outside held end well above head stanley trooper raising hand similarly other burmans then crawled under out of window a litter be moved forward through window took place of stanley trooper at pole silently moved on towards palisade stanley meinik followed joined by two burmese guard not slightest sound be made a eight men crossed short distance to palisade passed through opening where others spear in hand be awaiting ready to rush in take part in fray must alarm be given stanley breathed great sigh of relief a passed out few pace further halted cross piece be lashed to pole thank god that be out harry stanley said a soon a did have hurt much nothing to speak of harry replied managed marvellously be really outside place altogether yes fairly out will be more comfortable when have lashed cross piece will not be lying then at bottom of bag a be now when work be completed proceeded at rapid pace for harry weight reduced by fever a have be be trifle to bearer others followed close behind in quarter of hour be well beyond town stanley spoke to harry once twice received answer so have doubt that cousin have dozed quietly off to sleep gentle motion of litter must be likely to have effect especially a harry have probably be lying awake for last night two listening for friend who might arrive at time when reached confines of forest torch have be carried by boy be lit carried two with exception of bearer who have one while kept close together round litter waved torch a went although heard cry of several tiger in forest have fear of being attacked a so many waving light must deter most hungry beast from venturing near once in chamber at temple litter be laid down on pile of reed leaf have be gathered day before together with great store of brushwood log harry still sleeping quietly in short time bright fire be blazing with light of torch chamber assumed quite cheerful appearance on way stanley have spoken to two guard thanked for service assured that must receive reward promised by meinik be british officer said who be at village with friend though be absent when be carried off a see be disguised have shown sign of uneasiness when approached temple meinik have assured that spirit must not venture to approach party having white man with that night have already be passed in temple without harm coming of meal consisting of slice of venison be at once prepared when be eaten whole party have lighted cigar spirit rose at success of enterprise soldier however have be disappointed at hearing that there be going to be stay for little time there to enable wounded man to gain strength may not stop long stanley said see with litter must not travel fast may be sure by time alarm have be given for when came to relieve at end of three hour must be found that be missing then must at once discover that captive have gone too by daybreak whole garrison will be out how many be there of there be three thousand men in town guard said after party of soldier came within short distance of two month ago fifteen hundred men be added to garrison well see with three thousand men must scour wood if overtook must be unable to make defence here may hope that will not discover if do can make desperate resistance for a only one man can enter door at time must be next to impossible for to force way in have gun have brace of pistol a others have spear will be a much a three thousand men must do to get in through door if did there be still narrower door in corner to defend beyond there be long narrow steep flight of stair one man must hold against host first thing in morning will carry store to upper chamber have water rice enough to last for month if be careful so that although hope wo find will not be at afraid of beating off if do so a soon a be daylight stone have be added to step at doorway be flung down then by united effort two remaining step be removed then helped other up last man being aided by two of comrade above there stanley said if do come to search for be not likely to suspect that have got badly wounded man up here may search big chamber that be in before others there may be on same level narrow entrance ten foot above be scarcely likely to attract attention if doe a said must fight out will be wonderfully hard nut for to crack then ordered men to carry store to upper chamber just a began work there be slight movement on bed stanley at once went up to harry be looking round in bewildered way well harry how be feeling have have capital sleep oh be stanley be not quite sure be dreaming where be must have gone off to sleep directly started for remember anything after spoke to when be making hammock more comfortable be in temple four five thousand year old must say be rock chamber temple be in ruin be ten mile from toungoo will wait here till pursuit for have slackened in week will be more fit to move than be at present must not like to carry far a be now besides if have pushed on must have be sure to overtake for fellow can run like hare why must not find here stanley well of course may do so entrance to chamber be ten foot above ground thing be have sort of superstition about place nothing must induce to approach after even in daytime like coming near lastly if do find will take time to force way in have five men two young fellow quite capable of fighting then there be two guard meinik trooper so see muster twelve have two gun brace of pistol spear for if can not defend that narrow passage against number of burmans will deserve fate besides there be even narrower door in corner behind must have to force in chamber beyond there be narrow straight staircase forty foot high man with axe ought to be able to hold against army be taking store up there now have got provision water for month when everything be straight there will carry up unless sit down in front of place regularly starve out be a safe a if be in prome wish to goodness have that hideous dye off stanley know be by voice what with colour that tattooing extraordinary hair know in least be in just same disguise a in made way down from ava stanley laughed felt very uncomfortable at first with nothing on short petticoat thing have got accustomed to now be bound to say that be cool comfortable now tell about wound be not very serious stanley have lick across head with sword be one brought down slice taken out of arm from elbow nearly up to shoulder also spear wound in side be trifle a glanced off rib if have be left a fell somebody have bound up wound at once must have be right by time fellow did bandage up to extent movement of litter set off bleeding again fancy lost pretty nearly blood in body think that be pure weakness rather than fever kept unconscious so long for gather from pantomime of trooper must have be nearly fortnight unconscious yes be certainly so when came first time harry think perhaps on whole be lucky that be must probably have have great deal more fever if have not be so very weak if have escaped that have gone on well might have be sent off to ava before must get arrangement made for escape tell about harry said seems to wonderful how managed stanley told whole story by time that have finished store have be taken upstairs fire most carefully extinguished a smoke must at once have betrayed cross piece of litter have be taken off to allow harry to be carried in through door be now lifted two of men took off cloth wrapped material of bed into carrying up at once a soon a have gone on harry be slowly carefully taken to upper chamber laid down again on bed stanley took place beside rest of party went down to lower room having received strictest order not to show near entrance not to smoke until well assured that pursuer must have passed on ahead bamboo of litter be converted into rough ladder on meinik took post at little window in second of lower room owing to immense thickness of rock wall did not get extensive view must see path by anyone coming up through forest must approach temple be now about half past seven by time pursuer might be at hand in ten minute indeed distant shout must be heard stanley at once went down joined men below placed in line of doorway a wall here be four foot thick room be in semi darkness standing well back be certain that figure must not be perceived by anyone standing in glare of sunshine outside sound grew louder louder in minute two officer followed by twenty men emerged from tree paused when saw temple men must have drawn back at once officer shouted to to advance although showing small inclination to do so be still standing irresolute when superior officer on horseback followed by fifty footman came up path shouted order for to search temple a fear of be even greater than dread of spirit whole of men made way over fallen stone up to face of rock first entered chamber where horse have be stabled officer who have first arrived went in with men coming out reported to senior that there have be fire made that horse have also be there that three week month must have passed since then be sure of quite certain lord be extraordinary that anyone must have dared to enter there still le to stable horse when a everyone know temple be haunted by evil spirit care nothing for spirit officer said be men be in search of go look into other chamber there may be at moment deep mournful sound be heard louder louder rose then gradually died away soldier stood a if paralysed even high official who have be obliged to leave horse make way across fallen block on foot stepped back pace with expression of awe soon recovered shouted angrily to men to go on again dirge like noise rose louder louder swelled then a gradually died away time with quavering modulation men looked up round gazed at upper part of rock straight ahead while others turned round faced forest search officer shouted furiously evil spirit evil spirit not man will stir from here until place be searched then rose shrill vibrating sound a if of eerie laughter not even officer authority fear of punishment must restrain soldier with cry of alarm rushed across ruin plunged into forest followed at rate tried in vain to make dignified by officer who a soon a reached horse leapt upon galloped away burmese keenly appreciate joke a soon a troop have fled villager guard inside temple threw down on ground roared with laughter stanley at once made way into upper room splendidly done meinik be like note of organ although knew what be going to do felt almost startled when deep note rose wonder be frightened well at rate master be safe for present for present doubt meinik question if sha' hear of again that officer be determined looking fellow though be scared too stuck to like man be governor of town master saw carried through street in chair everyone be bending to ground a passed be famous general at one time say that be likely to command part of army again when fighting begin well think that will hear of again meinik suppose that really thought that be here for certainly burman must take up abode in place even to save life will push on chase through wood day by time will feel sure that must have overtaken have gone straight on then must not be at surprised if try here again perhaps will master like enough will chop off head of of men ran away pick out of best troop for search still hope wo think of stanley shook head hope so too meinik there be one thing about feel certain if doe find here will stay here at rate leave troop here until get must know that must get into trouble at ava for letting prisoner escape must be important for to recapture now be up here meinik will go have look at upper staircase again if be besieged be only hope of safety again went along ledge up staircase stanley examined stone blocked passage for time at last exclaimed there meinik look along by side of stone can see ray of light yes leaf think be more than thirty foot above meinik applied eye to crevice see master yes think leaf be more than distance away be came to look for stanley said be evident that rubbish must only be stone of root pavement over depression in middle of ruin that must not block up staircase very far question be will be possible to clear away evidently will be frightfully dangerous work one might manage to get one stone out at time in safety at moment loosening of one stone might bring number of others down with run anyone on narrow staircase must be swept away like straw meinik agreed a to danger well need not think over now meinik if be really besieged be by way that must escape if at must hope that sha' be beset if be must try here must rather be killed at once by fall of stone on head than tortured to death meinik nodded descended stair put out torch that have used there returned along ledge to chamber where harry be lying so meinik scared away latter said a stanley sat down beside must not think what be going to do when came up here with long reed a thick a leg showed to saw that have sort of mouthpiece fixed into made sign that be going to blow down when did be tremendous a got louder louder put hand to ear everything seemed to quiver other row that diabolical laughing noise made with smaller one be frightful big note be more like trombone only twenty time louder well do think that have done with hope so harry at rate can be assured that will never fight way up here long before provision be finished have doubt that will be able to hit on plan of escape day passed quietly wood be a silent a usual burmans be in high spirit at success of meinik horn when became dark hung blanket before entrance placed one of lad on watch just outside then lighted fire stanley took couple of torch went up to harry taking precaution to hang cloth before window have not said much about thanking old fellow harry said must know how feel have better say nothing about harry have only done what must have done have be in place have be in charge of party have be carried off know must have done in power to rescue might not have succeeded quite so well because know language know that must have tried after have not run anything like so much risk a did when rescued meinik from leopard of course be absolute stranger to besides be not rescued yet wo holloa until be out of wood be very cool pleasant here harry said after lying without speaking for few minute be dreadfully hot in hut in middle of day used to feel that lost almost a much strength in day a picked up at night be wonderfully better evening of course that long sleep have something to do with pleasure of being free with have still more certainly coolness air blowing through opening have counted for something well will feed up a long a be here harry hope in fortnight to see pretty firm on leg again then if there be nothing to prevent will carry off triumphantly meinik here came in with two bowl of broth for have bought few earthenware utensil on one of visit to toungoo be first rate harry said a finished first one what be made of never ask question stanley replied who tried successfully to keep down smile meinik be capital cook turn out sort of nice little dish here come step again what have there meinik asked a burman entered with two plate slice of mutton done on stick over fire master rice with be first rate harry said heartily when have finished did not give meat in prison suppose thought be not strong enough for eat very little meat harry now fancy dinner be done except fruit have got plenty of that there be however fried banana harry declared that have feasted like king if go on stanley will wager that will be about in week will be offering to run race with in fortnight will be good deal longer than before be fit to walk distance still with good appetite be sure to have after illness plenty of food cool air in cave do expect that will pick up fast next day passed quietly will be glad when tomorrow be over stanley said to meinik last thing before going up to harry cell today expect be marching back again if pay visit will be early tomorrow morning be sure that two men be on watch can relieve other hour will come down occasionally to see that be right think that even governor must get men to come near place after dark will keep good watch master have fear of coming chapter attack stanley got up several time during night went below to watch a felt sure must be nervous for though have now to large extent got over superstitious fear must still be timid at night reported that everything be still round temple that have heard distant sound in wood on first of occasion have after returning to room above gone out on to ledge from height must see reflection in sky of number of fire extending in semicircle at distance of mile so from temple from felt convinced that governor be determined to have thorough search made in morning a soon a be daylight sound of blowing of horn beating of drum be heard in forest hour later large body of men poured out from tree headed by governor now shouted place be to be searched in hole corner a to evil spirit there be fear of by day night did ever hear of attacking large body of men may strangle single traveller who venture into haunt one ever heard of burmese army being attacked by now man have to do duty first who waver head be to be struck off at once forward troop rushed impetuously across ruin penetrated into various chamber in rock in few minute be reported to be empty there be chamber higher up governor said will search look at door up there must lead to somewhere bring stone make stair up to be evident now that there be longer hope of concealment stanley stepped to entrance lord governor shouted there be strong force here army must not gain entrance wish to take life of brave men if be attacked must defend pray to withdraw with not to throw away life address from apparent peasant excited wrath of governor who shouted shoot men before order must be obeyed stanley have stepped back into chamber where have already ordered men to stand out of line of door number of musket be fired several bullet struck back wall of chamber firing continued stanley said keep where be men until have finished then approach door for directly begin attack men behind must stop firing will be minute yet ran quickly up to harry room be attacking harry exclaimed oh how wish must come down help can never get in harry british soldier might do not fellow can only enter two abreast with dozen spear point facing what can do thought must just come up tell be all right will take five minute at least to pile up stone level with doorway stanley again joined below meinik trooper one of burmese be to form first line four other burmese be to stand behind with spear between men in front two guard with musket boy be to act a reserve stanley have armed with one of ax be to stand by side of entrance so that if spearmen be pressed back of assailant succeeded in passing entrance must strike down presently there be silence outside keep well back said have laid stone will have rush directly will most likely pour in volley first pause lasted for minute two then drum be beaten hundred musket be fired rain of bullet flew into cave now stanley shouted form up illustration in vain burmese tried to force way into chamber wild yell be raised by burmese now knew that be fighting human foe courage returned there be rush of men up pile of stone to entrance in vain tried to force way into chamber in front fell pierced by spear while defender must see figure against light assailant coming out from sunshine must see nothing in chamber be now darkened by filling up entrance not once be necessary for stanley to strike burmans spear did work thoroughly in two three minute entrance be nigh choked up with dead body adding to difficulty of assailant pressed on by behind foremost fell over obstacle be instantly pierced by spear until be no longer possible to get through outer entrance much le make way into chamber again again attack be repeated a often repulsed before advancing burmese time endeavoured to clear passage by drawing out body of comrade two guard now posted in front shot man after man who made attempt at last burmese drew off not till fifty sixty have be killed governor be seen gesticulating furiously to party of officer presently final attack be made led by several officer of rank be a unsuccessful a others body indeed of killed now forming well nigh impassable barrier after several of officer many of bravest men have fallen remainder withdrew suddenly governor appeared to recognize that task be impossible one two three hundred men be at once set to work felling tree by high stockade have be erected round open ground in front of temple be going to try to starve out stanley said there be more chance of fighting tonight a soon a stockade be finished musketeer took place behind opened dropping fire at entrance while woodcutter continued to fell tree must get rid of dead body if can stanley said place will be uninhabitable in day two get two bamboo have for litter meinik will push body out one by one beginning with on top of heap can keep down behind shelter of pile till have got most of out after must take chance of shot took hour work at last passage be cleared body thrown outside fire be lighted in next room stanley bidding two men listen attentively for movement went up again to harry to whom have paid flying visit a soon a burmese drew off can not risk having light here harry said want to have idea that chamber be nearly fifty foot above entrance be in way connected with room below if such idea struck might lower men from above by rope so take in rear did say that be regularly shut up in front by stockade yes there be certainly no getting out way behind know be sheer wall of rock only possibility can see be that may clear staircase run up through rock from ledge on level of room to ruin of building above at present upper part be entirely choked up with block of stone rubbish will be very awkward job to get through so far seems to be that nothing what be going on chopping down tree for believe general be doing to bring large number of troop close up to stockade partly perhaps to keep up spirit of front line by company partly to render impossible attempt on part to make way out by sudden rush of course know what strength be have have so sharp lesson today that will take precaution in future well what be meinik have be talking together master think that if be to call out that might take body away without interference by must do so several officer of rank have fallen there be custom always to carry off dead when be possible must be worth trying experiment anyhow meinik must stand to arm while be doing a might make sudden rush however must risk that for body have be worrying very much must give anything to have taken away will go down with meinik accordingly went down to entrance shouted out peace peace be ordered by english officer to say that must wish who have fought so bravely to be honoured after death that shot will be fired interference made with who come to carry away dead there be silence for two three minute then voice called back be well for two hour there will be peace between have doubt governor be a glad to do a be be considered disgrace if dead be not carried off ground to burial if sends despatch to ava will be glad to be able to put in brave men who fell have be buried with due honour besides meinik must not be encouraging to troop for to have pile of dead body before indeed must be enough to cause pestilence in few day men be formed up again round entrance burmese did work silently occasionally slight movement be heard one must have imagined that hundred men be busy outside number of carried torch worked steadily in good order under direction of two three officer one of post of stockade have be pulled up through body be carried be le than two hour before horn sounded there be loud call of peace be over be done beyond stockade great fire blazed among tree work of chopping down forest continued by morning ground have be cleared for distance of thirty forty yard from paling then burmese raised stockade forty foot behind first so that if by carelessness treachery besieged must manage to pas through first line there must yet be in front of expect master meinik said a standing well back watched men at work general be building second line not because think that there be chance of getting through first to keep men at work so a to prevent from thinking anything about spirit now that have passed one night there will have got somewhat over fear of course day pass without ill befalling will think le le about evil one do believe in meinik meinik hesitated everyone know master evil spirit guard treasure of people lived in land long long ago one can doubt that people who have rashly sought treasure have be found dead with staring eye swollen body a at present must know well that outside be searching for treasure may not interfere then think that there be treasure buried here somewhere can not say master everyone say so story have be handed down that be once greatest of temple of old people when be defeated by tribe from east know not whether be people before priest from other temple came here remains of army came here too fought outside temple until be killed when conqueror entered found priest lying in regular line on pavement be dead one story be that have stabbed that have taken poison at rate treasure be found although be known that rich of temple be great that other priest have come here have brought treasure from temple with be beginning of destruction of place for pavement be torn up wall in place levelled image of god broken up in search for treasure work of guardian spirit have already begun say that who took part in search died of terrible pestilence broke out since time place have be accursed once twice king have sent body of troop to search say that must never find temple wandered about forest for day searching in vain for others found so thick darkness like blackest of smoke filling forest even bravest dare not enter say not that thing be so only say that be story have come down to well meinik be not going to search for treasure be evident that spirit bear ill will indeed feel obliged to for be likely enough that soldier will put down misfortune to influence that even governor may feel that must be useless to try to get to renew assault evening will go up have look at stair see how can best set to work to clear there be great hurry about sooner set to work better day long dropping fire be maintained on entrance by troop behind first stockade a with exception of three men kept always on watch defender be stationed in next chamber bullet pattered harmlessly against wall during night accumulated dust of age have be swept up from floor have be strewn three inch deep in passage between outer air chamber so a to cover blood have be shed there a soon a be quite dark stanley meinik three of villager went out on to ledge in front of upper opening made way along to entrance of stair mounted carried with two three glowing brand from fire in one of earthenware cooking pot be covered with cloth to prevent slightest glow being noticed by enemy men by stanley order brought with bamboo of litter saw have used at stockade hatchet block of firewood when got to point where step be choked up lighted two torch men who brought up rear of party holding up rug to prevent reflection from torch being seen outside when stanley meinik have again examined obstacle latter retired burmans one by one came up looked at do think of stanley asked must be dangerous to touch lord one of said if only one stone moved out from place must be death to be firm now quite firm if two three be disturbed whole might come down at once quite see that stanley said can of suggest plan by must get out without much risk of setting in motion burmese be silent will tell scheme then propose to cut bamboo into length will just reach across passage be lower stone that one be most afraid of so long a remain fixed there be fear of general movement if went whole mass might come down passage be le than three foot wide bamboo be twelve foot long so that must make four width of passage propose to drive tightly in fix firmly with wedge must be put in so that will actually touch stone so a to prevent making slightest downward movement if began to slide doubt must carry away bamboo if be fixed firmly by wedge ought to be sufficient to prevent movement from taking place especially a there must be enough of almost to touch other extending from lowest step on rock rest five foot upwards be to within two foot of roof must be sufficient for to crawl through bamboo must serve a ladder then propose that must work way along top passing small stone rubbish backwards after filling up crack crevice below see of course that must meet with many obstacle great stone may be sticking up perhaps jammed against roof must have to be broken off chipped in piece doubt work will take time at rate there be plenty of food for three week working by turn night day ought to be able to burrow way out a get on may not find stone so tightly pressed together a be here at rate a saw light above only thirty foot up there ought not to be above twenty foot of closely packed stuff to get through doubt work will be dangerous a well a hard a know that if succeed life be forfeited can face danger everyone of will take share in turn will do so will direct work in general what do think of plan think that be possible master meinik said at rate must try since be only way that offer chance of life burmese agreed at once set to work bamboo be first cut into length then by mean of axe wedge be jammed so firmly from side to side that must have required great force to dislodge support be somewhat irregularly placed a be necessary that must absolutely touch stone a proceeded with work space behind bamboo be filled tightly up with rubble so a to solidify whole when last support be in place stanley said now meinik do with three work tonight four others will take place before dawn mind at first want to attempt to move fixed stone simply to clear away small stone rubble can stow good deal behind two upper bamboo rest must put on stair will see tonight what can manage in way of tool for chipping away big stone can not be moved have better relieve other very often three who be not at work must sit down on ledge outside so that stone accidentally dislodged will not fall on anyone ten minute one will come up to take place of man at work be sure a pass up down replaces blanket carefully have indeed before beginning to saw up bamboo fastened blanket to one of cross piece of stretcher cutting to width of passage have jammed close up to roof so that curtain hanging down effectually shut off light stanley then descended step rejoined harry below before going down further stanley who have during day informed harry of plan told of start that have made of course depends upon what stone meet with harry said if come to big solid block see how be going to get through have hatchet can whittle away perhaps can make chisel from ramrod of guard gun lot can be done with patience plenty of hand stanley then went down below explained to others plan proposed news gave great satisfaction for although meinik have told there be staircase above blocked with stone have seemed so impossible to to clear that have placed no stress upon fact preparation made by enemy to cut off possible retreat have greatly depressed stanley took one of iron ramrod raking of ember from fire placed in about foot from one end then directed others to fan ember until raised almost to white heat taking ramrod out laid edge of one of knife upon striking back with stone soon cut through glowing rod repeated operation have then three short rod of equal length now heated one end of laying on axe on ground hammered into chisel shape with back of light hatchet repeating several time until have required shape sharpness then plunged into pot of water did same with other two have now three chisel with hoped to be able to chip away stone other ramrod left intact except that sharpened one end then going up to harry room lay down slept for hour putting two boy on watch bidding trooper look after two burmans with one of guard be to go to work with several time woke last time on looking out thought that there be faint light in sky going down called up three men bidding bring up two heavy ax light hatchet three short chisel led up step to working party how have got on meinik have cleared four foot master there be big stone sticking up now can hing with will have try do go down at once take off cloth one of fill with rubbish on step do a quickly a can day will be breaking in few minute stanley now climbed up investigated passage bottom be level crack crevice between stone being filled up with rubbish obstacle meinik have spoken of evidently formed part of flat slab reached within inch of roof at one side touched rock wall at other there be interval of four five inch earth rubbish have already be scraped out from behind putting hand in found that block be four inch in thickness thought that if must get fair blow at with back of one of heavy ax might break off be impossible total width of passage did not exceed three foot a men have a went worked down somewhat there be now about thirty inch between bed of earth rubbish on be lying roof taking handle of axe in hand used head a battering ram without success then called up slightest of three men told to crawl in beside with united strength pounded stone for time finding that nothing must be done way stanley sent man back again then taking one of three chisel small hatchet proceeded to mark line along bottom of stone then for ten minute worked away on with chisel hammer then called up one of others showed what be to do day worked by turn though progress be very slow by groove be inch deep stanley strongest burman then went in together lying on back again tried effect of heavy axe still without success then stanley told man to get down take out wedge at top of axe to cut away wood below head so that latter must slip down four five inch then to take off head of other heavy axe put on above replace wedge in few minute man rejoined must strike a near roof a can stanley said grasped handle firmly will sway backwards forward three time third time strike one two three hooray a two headed axe driven with united force struck stone there be sharp crack have done stanley said turning over there be dark line along groove top of stone inclined back two inch from perpendicular being kept in place by rubbish behind stanley put hand into hole got finger behind stone while burmese put chisel into crack used a lever in two three minute stone be moved out of position taken out of hole laid down on step hour later meinik came up with trooper guard one of boy be delighted to find that obstacle have seemed to fatal to hope have be removed stanley showed how have carried out work then with party went down into rock chamber be pretty tiring work harry said though be only at about quarter of hour at time wrist arm shoulder be aching a if have be beaten with stick tomorrow will take up good supply of firewood chisel got blunted before have worked hour must get on deal faster if must sharpen frequently be stone hard be sort of marble think have underpart of slab on side did not think of looking when took down anyhow be not very hard with good strong chisel short heavy hammer be sure must have done in hour anyhow be comfort that nothing came down on top of examined pile carefully there have not be slightest movement among lower stone so part of difficulty seems to have be got over now must go down get something to eat then will go in for good sleep be feeling right hope must not be doing better stanley have eaten three solid meal today have be sitting up on edge of bed for time tried standing be go still do think that in day two will manage for six day work continued one party watched slept third worked by turn of stone gave much greater trouble than first have met with having fire close by proved great assistance a chisel must be frequently sharpened men became more accustomed to work steady progress made greatly excited hope at end of week one stone barred way however be much most formidable that have encountered seemed to have be pillar huge gate post be square measuring twenty inch on face obstacle be more formidable a upper end be inclined towards greatly increasing difficulty in using chisel beyond a far a must see there be merely mass of smaller stone party who have be working upon block be much disheartened when stanley went up to relieve owing to inclination of stone chisel must get little bite though have be working for six hour at have scarcely made impression indeed at only one point have so far broken face that chisel must cut meinik have come down two hour before to report to stanley nature of obstacle when went up took with second ramrod have not hitherto be used saw at once that a meinik have told must be impossible to get through block by same mean a before for a groove deepened labour must become greater greater from inclination of stone must in time arrive at point where axe must no longer be used to strike chisel point at slight indentation have be made be nearly at corner of stone be gradually enlarged by hammering upon with head of axe after hour work surface have be so far pounded that chisel must get flat hold upon then stanley one of burmans lay down placed cutting end of long ramrod against others by turn struck end with back of light hatchet holding rod turning slightly after blow half hour edge of chisel be resharpened by time next party relieved hole of inch in diameter two inch deep have be drilled in stone stanley remained with newcomer for hour instructing in work then went below well stanley what be going to do with monstrous stone meinik tell of there be only one thing to do with harry be to blast block be so inclined that one can hing with chisel be now drilling hole know that will succeed at rate be going to have try if fails must hit on other way provision be holding out right meinik calculates that with little stinginess must manage for three week have drilled hole in two inch today a get more accustomed to work dare say must do three inch in shift block be twenty inch through on straight may be two foot on line that follow so that in four day will be nearly through in three week will have made five hole will weaken so that may be able to break off however hope will find one hole sufficient will make fifteen inch deep then charge with content of dozen cartridge think that ought to do in two day half hole be of required depth harry have progressed so rapidly that be able that morning to walk across room must try shot at once stanley said because if fails must go on working if succeeds can if like wait for week before make off by time will be strong enough to be got through low passage walk for little distance when can cut pole rig up hammock again do know anything about mining for know nothing only have idea how to drill hole from seeing engineer at work at agra year ago be sure know how fired shot prepared can tell little about stanley for have be down coal mine once twice watched men doing first of put in charge then put in wooden rod just thickness of fuse use then dropped in little dry dust round pressed down very carefully with small wooden rod then damped dust hammered that down hard after putting in about inch of used dust slightly moistened beating down a before when be quite full pulled out centre stick put fuse into hole that left have not got fuse stanley said think that if take narrow strip of cloth moisten rub gunpowder into let dry then roll up must be all right then must lay train of damp powder to set end alight bolt must think that must do harry agreed must have to bolt very sharp for if went off before got to bottom of step might be very awkward think effect of shock will be a great a harry may crack stone must hardly think must send anything flying out of hole chapter rejoining day since siege have begun defender have fired occasional shot at stockade not with idea of doing damage in order that assailant must know that be still in cavern that evening when hole have got to proper depth stanley having prepared fuse went up with twenty cartridge in pocket accompanied by meinik hole be charged tamped fuse inserted took considerable time fuse have be cut so that inch of projected outside hole other eight cartridge be then broken up powder moistened train two foot long laid from fuse towards entrance of hole then piece of rag be wrapped round one end of ramrod again be tied to long rod have night before be cut by one of boy who have slipped out noiselessly from entrance rag have be moistened rubbed with gunpowder now meinik stanley said everything be ready rod be sixteen foot long so that lying down foot will be just at edge of hole will be able to drop down a soon a have lighted train bolt will fix torch foot so from train then will only have to lift rod to light rag set fire to train then slide down bolt now must go down first master meinik said firmly will light train think that there be danger whether there be not will undertake if be killed doe not matter while if be killed must be lost for if explosion did not burst stone be sure that must never be able to get through without to direct master if stay stay must only lessen chance of running down step in time stanley argued even ordered meinik be obstinate seeing that faithful burman be not to be moved reluctantly left matter in hand went downstairs moved short distance along ledge waited time seemed age to so that gave exclamation of delight when meinik suddenly came into sight took place beside have lit train master powder fizzed up did not seem to burn very fast be indeed two minute before deep muffled roar be heard there be further noise heard shout from burmans behind stockade will be wondering what sound be stanley said will not be able to tell from what direction came for expect be pretty nearly sound asleep now let go up see result made way up step be now in entire darkness curtain still hung in place ten foot below obstacle lit torch from ember in pan then stanley climbed up into passage hastily crawled along gave cry of satisfaction a approached end explosion have be completely successful end of block lay on ground whether whole of have be blown off not must not see felt sure that greater portion must have split off be evident that must take considerable amount of time must require strength of several men to get block out therefore descended at once to gladden heart of below with news that way out be now available to whenever chose to leave harry manifested surprise at news made sure that must succeed stanley after getting off a did making own escape before seems to that have got hold of 'open sesame ' of ali baba have only to use cabalistic word to walk in out wherever want to go feel by mean so certain of own power a seem to be harry can assure be very doubtful whether shot must succeed hoped at rate that must blow good bit of stone out in case must have got chisel to work again be slanting position of block beat however thank goodness work be done now have only to get bit stronger will be off be quite ready to start now stanley think be absurd waiting longer for there be never saying what might take place that burmese general who seems to be obstinate beggar might take into head to place guard on top of hill then labour will have be thrown away be true enough harry a really think that travelling now must be likely to do serious harm will decide on tomorrow at rate will take men up at once get stone out task be difficult one block of stone be so nearly size of passage that must not get rope round behind after trying for two hour in vain determined that only course be to push before soon found however that be impossible that part at least of stone be remaining in place finally succeeded in pushing loop in rope over top of block then by main force eight of pulled out of hole lowered on to top step by time that have done dawn be approaching therefore returned at once to chamber below men be all much pleased when stanley told that must leave night confident a felt that burmese must not force way in new feeling of nervousness seized now that way be open lest unforeseen circumstance might occur to prevent going rice remained be made up into three four package meat have long before be finished stanley have discussion with meinik a to how harry have best be taken through passage must agreed walk along ledge with one before one behind to steady must then be carried up step in blanket by four men must of course be lifted into passage dragged through to end after that must be easy enough six men must carry in blanket until far enough away for to chop pole without sound of ax being heard by burmese from time began work pain have be taken to deaden sound blanket hung across passage have acted a muffler to extent piece of cloth have always be tied over hammer head of ax to prevent sharp clinking sound of blow on chisel stone being heard a soon a be dark enough for to pas along ledge meinik went with stanley to examine ground fortunately portion of stone remained above level prevented rock from being rolled back be small be able to break up in hour with ax then making way along without difficulty for four foot found standing upright in depression in centre of ruin mounting six more step be among bush covered site of temple now carefully cleared away fragment of stone from floor of passage returning stanley gave order for start to be made two three shot be fired from lower entrance to show enemy that be there on watch then went up to harry room have be dressed for first time be ready for start two of strongest of burmans went on first now harry be to put hand on shoulder meinik will follow close behind will keep arm round in case need help of course will go along very slowly think that precaution be necessary harry said be sure can walk distance easily enough why say stair be only about forty foot dare say must harry want to run risk head be not very strong at present might turn giddy might stumble so at present will have just to do a be told let start harry did not find a easy a have expected getting out through lower opening be by mean sorry to have support of stanley meinik a proceeded along ledge moved very carefully slowly be greatly relieved when sat down on blanket laid on step now lie back harry will have difficulty in getting up here two burmans took upper end of blanket stanley meinik lower be soon at top of step be not very heavy now harry be good deal heavier than be when brought in below now next be most difficult part of work once get through passage will be plain sailing see will have to be dragged place be only two foot high so that must be impossible to lift at have made floor a smooth a can be afraid that there be good many projecting corner will try good deal can not be helped stanley fire away a soon a like rest of party be now all gathered on step below meinik stanley getting up first into hole received harry a others lifted with aid of two of burmans laid on blanket in passage now stanley said to two men who took other end of blanket keep a tight a can when say 'lift ' will lift together move forward few inch hurry over have plenty of time before be packed so closely that have one arm available little by little moved along gaining six inch time then have to move so a to place for next effort however in five six minute have through carried up into open air rest of party at once joined with three of native on side of blanket be soon beyond circle of ruin making at brisk pace through forest after going for quarter of mile stopped cut pole for hammock in short time be on way again having placed in one of bag of rice a pillow for harry travelled for hour then halted to cook rice have slept good deal during day so after resting for hour proceeded on way again have fear whatever of pursuit only danger that must incur be from meeting with band similar to have carried harry off when rigged up hammock have cut wood for torch to protect from tiger be thrown away a soon a daylight broke at midday halted again for hour then continuing journey arrived at village before nightfall be received with great joy villager setting up shout of welcome friend of men boy being especially exuberant in joy for have become extremely anxious at long absence two trooper be still there saluted stanley with le than usual stiff formality of mohammedan soldier laughed look much like british officer at present said in language well have everything be quiet here yes sahib sowar brought order from general to remain here to send at once if heard news of sent off one of villager when man came back to fetch others said that have good hope of getting lieutenant brooke sahib out of hand of burmese will write note stanley said get horse saddled at once directly have made mr brooke comfortable will give letter during time stanley have be absent house have be re erected village have assumed general appearance hut be at once handed over to harry laid on bamboo pallet have not slept most of way down see be quite right stanley told that journey must be nothing fortunately have turned out so meinik have already killed chicken will make into broth for will be change for after diet of rice cooking be excellent for first three four day fell off sadly be one of reason why gave way to wish to start at once have done wonderfully well constant diet of rice be not quite thing for building up sick man now be going to write few line to general to say that have got safely down will need at least week before be able to sit on horse of course can be carried on think that air here be great deal more healthy bracing than be at prome longer stay here better stanley note be short one merely said that have succeeded in getting cousin trooper who be carried off at same time from hand of burmese harry be still very weak that if must be spared must stay with at village for week ten day at end of time must ride by easy stage to prome three day later trooper returned with note from general congratulate most heartily on having rescued cousin wrote by mean stay where be until be quite strong again place be not at healthy at present will not be moving forward for three week stanley remained at village for fortnight at end of time harry have so far recovered that be quite capable of making short day journey on horseback two of men who have aided in rescue have gone to prome with order from stanley on staff paymaster for reward have be promised to villager two burmese soldier returned with money men be highly delighted at result of expedition stanley retained service of two soldier a long a remained in village have fear whatever of same band returning have before visited village learned that others have be heard of in neighbourhood at same time thought a well that man must be on guard night day at end of village peasant agreed to watch at one end while two burmese soldier trooper took charge of other end bulk of villager be engaged in forming strong stockade round to defend in case of further attack stanley promised to send down twenty musket supply of ammunition a soon a got to prome there be real regret on part of burmese when time came for party to start have be something altogether new to to have official among who paid for everything englishman have treated kindly be pleased contented with everything money that five men two boy have earned have enriched village have enabled to more than replace loss by recent raid if stanley have accepted present of fruit fowl egg must have given must have needed couple of extra horse to convey strong pony have be purchased for meinik after taking hearty leave of villager party rode off wish have such good cook a man be stanley harry said a journeyed along at walk never tasted better soup than serf up must really get to teach mess cook how to make do know what be harry have not least idea might be anything think that tasted to more like stewed eel than anything else be not very far out be made of creature turned up nose at snake nonsense stanley be can assure must not tell before because might have set against that soup have in cave be made from snake flesh recess in part of cave swarmed with men laid in quite store of before be besieged unfortunately must not keep well even in cool chamber so have to fall back on rice liked so much that though there be occasion to have gone on with snake soup after got to village continued to give to for be very nourishing well be glad did not tell at time must own that be excellent think that in future will have objection to snake in form be just a good in other way stanley replied burmans be fool consider snake lizard be very much better eating than mutton be tasteless stuff at best will have to have big settlement when get back stanley of course men paid guard bribed be entirely account to say nothing of share of general expenditure general expense be practically nothing harry invited to come with of course be guest a to other matter that also be business must not say so if have not plenty of fund what with pay a interpreter year of back pay got when gazette came out have plenty out of income to pay for without breaking in upon amount told have got for ruby must pay stanley if be rolling in money not must mind taking money from if wanted expense since landed here have not be anything approaching pay allowance have besides a told income of pound year of own have risked life for be not going to let pay piper a well right if plea harry be delighted at having be able to save just at present money doe not seem important matter one way other so if really must be satisfaction to to pay will certainly not deprive of although only travelled ten mile first day harry acknowledged that be a tired a dog when dismounted be so stiff next morning that have to be helped on to horse however gradually wore off on evening of fourth day arrived at prome leaving harry at regimental camp stanley rode to headquarters there dismounted meinik have led second horse after harry dismounted now took across to line with air of man who have only be away few hour stanley at once went up to general welcome back lad sir archibald said have be longer away than expected when started be glad indeed that succeeded in rescuing cousin be burning

ready by time bugle sounded three four of staff be a usual member of party after meal be over be requested to narrate adventure at full length story be necessarily long one when concluded joined general in hearty commendation for manner in have carried out adventure last story be stirring one mr brooke general said be even more so when received first note thought next door to madness for to try to get cousin badly wounded a knew to be from hand of burmese be not easy thing to get man out of prison when man be unable to help seemed well nigh impossible be greatly afraid that instead of saving life must lose own of course fact that have successfully traversed country before be strongly in favour then be unencumbered two thing be therefore not to be compared with other will of course put in order tomorrow a having performed singularly gallant action in rescuing lieutenant brooke of th sowar from captivity by burmese in prison at toungoo have arrived just in time for after endeavouring to fool for past three month by negotiation never meant to come to anything enemy be now advancing in great force be within few mile of town so be likely to have hot work of for from account have got nearly a large army together a bandoola have know whether have learned anything from misfortune be bound to say that court doe not seem to have taken lesson in slightest degree to heart arrogance be just a insufferable a be before shot be fired stanley learnt that there have already be one fight enemy be advancing in three column right consisting of men commanded by sudda woon have crossed irrawaddy be marching down other bank with apparent object of recrossing below prome cutting british line of communication centre from to strong commanded by kee wongee be coming down left bank of river accompanied by great fleet of war boat left division strong led by old experienced general maha nemiow be moving parallel with others about ten mile distant from centre separated from by thick impenetrable forest reserve of men commanded by king half brother occupied strongly fortified post at melloon in addition to large force be gathered near pegu threatened attack upon rangoon on th of november fortnight before stanley return two brigade of native infantry under colonel m'dowall have marched out to dislodge maha nemiow whose division threatened to turn british right to move round to rear force be divided into three column one moving directly towards enemy position others marching by circuitous route so arranged a to arrive at point of attack at same time be to attack in flank rear while main body assailed enemy in front burmese have however obtained information from spy of intended movement advancing boldly met british column way skirmishing with hotly in wood threatening attack by large body of horse centre drove burmese before reached stockaded position colonel m'dowall while reconnoitring be killed by ball from musket a two flanking column did not arrive a expected force be compelled to fall back retreat be conducted in good order loss be heavy a burmese pressed hotly upon for several mile since unfortunate affair enemy have steadily advanced maha nemiow have moved directly upon prome advancing slowly constantly stockading centre have also advanced be now fortifying height above river five mile away within sight of prome sudda woon be intrenching on opposite bank division be working day night advancing steadily slowly erecting formidable line of intrenchment a went seemed to be intention of burmese general to proceed in manner until whole of troop be gathered within very short distance of town then to rush upon from side in morning stanley went to line of th harry have of course told story on arrival tale have circulated generally through regiment a rode in men ran out from hut cheered heartily le warm greeting did receive from officer in spite of protest that there have really be great difficulty danger in affair what specially admire one of officer said laughing be that man must have run risk on purpose to prevent from coming into earldom have only to leave matter alone there be heir to title estate must have be haunted by harry ghost stanley laughed must have be a bad a banquo macbeth must have sat at table stood at head of bed must have be much more serious affair to face than party of burmese title estate must have be too dear at price well behaved like brick anyhow colonel said there be not man in regiment who must not have be proud indeed if have accomplished feat half subaltern be talking at dinner last night of learning language so that if chance fell in way might emulate doings be rather tough language to master stanley replied gave more trouble than four five indian language speak be afraid campaign will be over long time before of officer learn to talk burmese well enough to pas a native after failure of expedition of th further effort have be made against enemy indeed troop have be withdrawn from outlying position there have even be feint made of embarking store a if with intention of retiring down river in hope of tempting burmese to make attack season have now come when operation must again be carried on general be anxious to strike decisive blow at enemy then to set forward on march towards ava a to result of fight one entertained slightest doubt although disparity in number be very great for while burmese commander have nearly men at disposal sir archibald campbell have more than of whom about one half be british be determined that main attack must be made on division of maha nemiow be now six seven mile away beyond fact that be very strongly intrenched in jungle information must be gained for most vigilant watch be kept up by effort to pas native spy into line failed be known that among division be shan from upper burma a men have not hitherto come in contact with be expected that must fight with more courage resolution than who have become acquainted with power large number of prince noble be with force great reliance be placed by burmese upon three young lady of high rank who be believed by to be endowed with supernatural gift to have power of rendering missile of english innocuous young woman dressed in warlike costume constantly rode among troop animating by presence exhorting to deed of courage english have received vague rumour of doings of burmese joans of arc thought probable that enemy must fight better than usual on november th arrangement be made for attacking enemy on following morning flotilla be to open furious cannonade upon work on side of river body of native infantry be to drive in advance post of centre while main force be to attack left in two column one moving directly against while other be to attack on right flank thus preventing enemy from retreating in direction of centre four regiment of native infantry be left in prome general cotton commanded main attack soon after column moved out from camp tremendous cannonade showed that flotilla be engaged with burmese on side of river column be composed of st th regiment with two battalion of native infantry proceeded distance before becoming engaged with enemy outpost a burmese have be deceived by cannonade believed that attack be entirely upon centre troop therefore reached main position around two native village without serious opposition illustration old burmese general be carried from point to point in litter a issued from jungle into cleared space in front of stockade rapidly formed up under tremendous fire rushed forward to attack old burmese general who be too infirm to walk must be seen carried from point to point in litter cheering on men while three amazon exposed fearlessly to fire ladder party however rushed forward unchecked in spite of opposition of enemy scaled stockade at one point won footing on rampart of earth behind others pressed after soon destructive fire be opened upon crowded mass pent up between outer stockade next burmese method of forming stockade behind stockade be useful against foe of greater dash energy than be absolutely fatal when opposed to english troop who gave time to fall back through narrow opening in paling be soon blocked by dying dead of shan led by chief fought with desperate courage be unable to stand advance of british whose steady volley poured in at distance of few yard swept away wounded horse rushing wildly about in throng added to terrible confusion group of men endeavoured to cut way through stockade behind others strove to climb over maha nemiow be killed while bravely exhorting men to stand ground one of heroic amazon be shot a soon a troop reached spot where fell saw that be woman be carried into cottage there died few hour afterwards stockade after stockade be carried until whole position fell into hand in meantime other column commanded by general campbell consisting of th th th th regiment th madras infantry have moved down on other side of nawine river taken up position to command ford there by fugitive from stockade must cross on way to join centre a crowd of frightened men issued from jungle poured across ford artillery opened upon with shrapnel completed discomfiture thought of joining centre be abandoned re entering jungle scattered greater portion of started for home intent only on avoiding contest with foe of burmese heroine be killed at ford three hundred men have be killed at storming of stockade far greater loss took place in retreat very few of shan ever regaining country greater portion perishing from starvation in great forest through travelled in order to escape burmese authority who must have forced to rejoin army chapter pride of burma humbled a soon a victory be completed troop piled arm be allowed two hour rest then marched back to point where general campbell division have forded nawine river in morning from point path led towards enemy centre be determined to attack at daybreak on following morning before news of defeat of left must reach day have be long fatiguing one be late before troop reached halting place meal be served out then lay down to rest messenger be sent to prome to announce success have be gained to request commander of flotilla to open fire in morning a soon a foe be seen to issue from jungle in front of wongee main position at napadee long before daylight troop be in motion general campbell division led way along narrow track leading towards river while general cotton who followed be ordered to break off at path led towards burmese division to make way through forest to attack stockade directly reached main division must attack a soon a heard gun after two hour march first division came out on open ground by river side signalled arrival to flotilla formed up in front of stockaded height of position be extremely strong one enemy occupied three range of hill rising one behind other commanding one in front of one flank of hill be protected by river other by almost impenetrable forest hill be covered with stockade a moved forward troop be exposed to so heavy fire from enemy entrenched at edge of jungle on right before must advance further be necessary to first drive from position six company of th be sent back into forest making way through came down in rear of stockade speedily cleared of defender compelled advance force of enemy to join main body troop then moved forward to foot of first hill where two strong redoubt have be erected by enemy fleet opened fire column be halted for time awaiting sound of firing must tell general cotton column be engaged sound however be heard for force have be unable to make way through dense forest general campbell at last gave order for attack be commenced by th th native infantry under colonel elvington who pushed through jungle forest until reached of flanking outwork on hill attacked with such dash determination that speedily obtained possession of thus produced favourable diversion for main attack consisting of th th th regiment advanced steadily without returning shot to incessant fire from enemy various entrenchment captured two redoubt at bottom of hill then pressed upwards carrying position after position at point of bayonet till arrived at summit of first hill burmese fugitive a fled to next line of defence shook courage of troop there british pushing forward hotly on rear of flying crowd carried work after work until in course of hour whole position nearly three mile in extent be entirely in possession between forty fifty gun be captured enemy loss in killed wounded be very great while by desertion alone wongee lost third of army while attack have be going on flotilla have passed work protecting river face of hill have captured boat store filled with supply for use of burmese army thus two of three burmese division have now be completely routed there remained only that of sudda woon on other side of river troop be allowed two day rest on morning of th force advanced on board flotilla passage across river be covered by fire of rocket brigade mortar battery have on previous night be established on island landed at distance above enemy stockade then marched round attacked in flank rear while battery boat of flotilla cannonaded in front enemy troop be already disheartened by defeat have seen inflicted upon wongee army after feeble resistance fled to second line of stockade in jungle to rear troop however pressed so hotly upon that be unable to make effectual opposition here number fell while endeavouring to pas through narrow entrance of work rest fled in terror into wood extensive operation have be carried out with loss of six officer seventy eighty men only be known that enemy have very strongly fortified several position in around meaday be determined to push forward at once on long march of three hundred mile to ava before enemy must rally from defeat gather for defence of position on th first division under general campbell started from prome road be extremely bad be able to move slowly course be first directed inland a be intended to turn enemy position at meaday by following road several mile from river thus forcing to fall back a advanced on next day force reached spot where colonel m'dowall have be killed in unsuccessful attack upon maha nemiow then turned north followed road parallel to river on th tremendous rain for hour converted road into morass although march be five mile long greater portion of column failed to reach destination however be not worst cholera broke out at once carried off large number of victim two of british regiment being rendered almost unfit for service by ravage on th division encamped on dry ground on ridge of wooded hill waited for couple of day to allow baggage train to come up change greatly benefited health of troop amusement be afforded by partridge jungle fowl deer abounded in neighbourhood of camp up to point single native have be seen village be destroyed country be completely deserted on th strong burmese fortification be taken being unoccupied save by small picket retired on advance have evidently be erected for purpose of preventing river fortification from being turned abandonment proved that object of land march have be gained that enemy have abandoned position have with so much care prepared for defence of river on th joined general cotton column next day entered meaday here terrible spectacle be met with town ground within stockade be strewn with dead dying from wound others from cholera for ravage of plague have be a great among burmese a in british force number of men be found crucified on gibbet doubtless a punishment for attempting to desert air be pestilent force be glad indeed to march on next morning from locality gained something not much from change for next fifty mile dead body be met with at very short interval day before camping many corps have to be removed before tent must be fixed be now known that burmese army in retreat have be concentrated at melloon where reserve of men have be posted on th division encamped within four mile of town have now marched hundred forty mile from prome without meeting single inhabitant of country being enabled to obtain cattle for supply of troop so effectually have enemy wasted country a retired melloon stood on opposite bank of irrawaddy letter have arrived from town saying that commissioner have arrived from ava with full power from king to conclude treaty of peace colonel adair stanley accordingly be sent off next morning to melloon to arrange for immediate meeting for commissioner however must come to arrangement burmese leader insisting that so important business must only be carried on when favourable day arrived that time must at present be stated seeing that principal object of burmese be to gain time colonel informed through stanley that a arrangement have be made troop must recommence advance a soon a returned to camp accordingly next morning division moved forward to town immediately opposite melloon place stood on face of sloping hill a irrawaddy be here yard broad good view be obtained of fortification principal stockade be in form of square about mile on face mounting considerable number of gun especially on side facing river succession of stockade extended for mile farther along bank great work be crowded with men in front of town lay large fleet of war boat larger craft with store short time after troop reached spot great noise of gong drum other warlike instrument arose on other side crowd of boatman be seen running down to vessel be soon manned oar got out began to row up river a owing to intricacy of channel steamboat flotilla have not yet arrived few shot be fired at boat by field gun have desired effect many of boatman jumping overboard leaving craft to drift down river while great bulk hastily turned vessel about anchored in former position a soon a steamer with flotilla came up two war boat pushed off from shore saluted steamer rowed alongside of until flotilla be safely anchored above town be so evidently mark of real desire for suspension of hostility that two officer be again sent across river truce be agreed upon arrangement made for meeting of negotiator upon following day four meeting be held between two commissioner appointed by british general meeting taking place on boat moored in centre of river at length treaty be accepted signed by burmese fifteen day truce allowed for ratification of treaty by king a end of period approached burmese protested that have not yet received answer asked for further time be refused unless on condition that melloon be evacuated burmese army fell back until ratification of treaty reached a have be for time strongly suspected negotiation be simply device to arrest advance treaty be afterwards found in burmese camp never having be forwarded to ava at midnight on th when armistice came to conclusion troop began throwing up earthwork heavy gun be landed from flotilla at ten o'clock next morning twenty eight gun be in position ready to open fire in spite of remonstrance have be made burmese have night after night during armistice continued to work surreptitiously at entrenchment be hoped for moment when saw speed with battery have be thrown up armed must offer farther resistance a however be evidently preparing for action gun opened fire at eleven o'clock be kept up for two hour while be going on troop intended for assault be embarked in boat distance up river so a to ensure not being carried by force of stream across face of burmese work exposed to concentrated fire of enemy be divided into four brigade first of consisting of th th regiment under lieutenant colonel sale be to land below stockade to attack south western angle while other three brigade be to land above to carry outwork there to attack northern face strong northerly wind violent current prevented assault being made simultaneously first brigade be carried too far across a passed stockade be exposed to fire of gun musketry of river defence while three other brigade be unable for time to reach intended landing place colonel sale be among wounded by burmese fire directly first brigade reached shore formed up under partial cover of shelving bank led by lieutenant colonel frith moved forward to assault in admirable order when within short distance there be forward rush in spite of storm of shot ladder party gained foot of stockade placing ladder climbed up leapt down among surging crowd of enemy others followed soon firm footing be obtained in work then men of two regiment whose total strength did not exceed five hundred advanced steadily drove before armed men expelled from work that burmese have deemed impregnable while be going on other three brigade have landed above stockade now falling upon enemy a poured out from work completed defeat stockade be carried whole of artillery store fell into possession four day later army again began advance be met by four englishman who have be taken prisoner american who have also be held in confinement have be sent to assure english general that king be in earnest in desire for peace be too evident however that confidence must be placed in burmese negotiation be moreover known that army be being assembled in greatest haste to bar advance on th of february british reached pakang yay having passed sembeughewn on opposite shore be point where road from aracan reached irrawaddy have be arranged that force have be operating in aracan must if possible effect junction with sir archibald campbell here message brought down by native be however received stating that force have suffered very severely from fever cholera that natural obstacle be found to be too great to be overcome by troop debilitated by disease that attempt have therefore be abandoned fortunately english general be well able to do without addition to strength have already proved that command be perfectly capable of defeating burmese force must be brought against addition must only have increased difficulty of transport on th of march british force owing to necessity for leaving strong body to hold melloon other point have be captured now mustered le than fighting men advanced to attack enemy whose number be estimated at new commander of burmese adopted other tactic than predecessor stockaded position be in front of town of pagahn occupied jungle in great force attacked advance guard five mile from town a enemy occupied hill on side of main road sir campbell divided force led half of through jungle on right while general cotton led other half through wood on left burmese fought with considerable obstinacy general campbell staff with thirty eight trooper fifty men of th be somewhat in advance of column when enemy closed in on flank even got in rear be however dispersed by rest of th driving back burmese on flank advance be continued presently however a british issued from jungle mass of enemy horse charged down drove back skirmisher for time position of general staff be one of great peril little body of trooper however dashed boldly at assailant held in check until gun have followed staff be brought forward from jungle then trooper divided rode right left gun opening fire checked assailant until infantry came up burmese army be now seen drawn up in form of semicircle in open two british column be united together moved forward to attack centre of crescent disregarding fire from wing when within charging distance went forward with rush cheering lustily fell upon burmese broke centre thus isolating two wing burmese at once retreated with greatest haste to stockaded position in rear a usual narrow entrance to stockade caused great delay british be upon before be in way prepared to resist assault heralding advance by sweeping volley fell upon burmese with bayonet drove out of work enemy made attempt to rally behind wall in pagoda of town effort be vain be driven out with great slaughter hundred be drowned in endeavouring to swim river army be finally dispersed in direction effect of victory be at once apparent country people who have on advance of british force from prome be cleared out from village along whole line of route being now freed from restraint of troop came flocking back in great number by road in boat be evident that regarded struggle a definitely terminated there be indeed possibility of further resistance a army of burma raised with immense difficulty by heavy bounty promise of great reward be hopelessly scattered ava lay open to british advance in other direction position be equally desperate aracan have be wholly rescued from grasp british force in pegu have marched up river sitang after repulse of party of hundred fifty men imprudently sent to attack sitang captured place after sharp fight receiving reinforcement from rangoon continued way up river captured toungoo while northern force have driven burmese out of manipur have reached river ningti by nd of february be in position to advance direct upon ava after halt of two day general campbell advanced on th of february mr price american who have be sent down after capture of melloon went forward to ava with treaty have be drawn up before capture of place king have longer hesitation in complying with term be indeed delighted to find that recent victory of invader have not increased demand at once sent down to accept a official ratification be sent march continued while mr price again returned to ava when force be within four day march of capital latter returned with burmese commissioner other high functionary with ratified treaty first instalment of money be to be paid be disappointment to army that after long march many suffering be not to be allowed to enter enemy capital in triumph undoubtedly however course taken be wisest ava be regarded a sacred city be to save from humiliation of being occupied by invader that king have brought to accept term of treaty have english general insisted upon entering capital signing treaty there must have found one to meet population must have be driven out king court must have retired farther up country war might have continued for indefinite time already cost have be enormous exceeding pound sterling during first eleven month after landing at rangoon nearly half of european died from time advanced from town with fresh reinforcement from india to arrival near ava similarly heavy loss be sustained four percent of number engaged be killed in action climate of aracan be still more deadly a three fourth of white troop employed there died very few of survivor be ever fit for service afterwards sepoys suffered le in aracan losing only ten percent of number though nearly force be in hospital for time according to agreement burmese a soon a peace be concluded sent down large number of boat for conveyance of troop down river a descended garrison left at melloon other place be withdrawn one of native regiment with elephant gun left force at sembeughewn marched thence to aracan for purpose of investigating country proving whether be practicable for passage of troop in case advance upon ava must ever be necessary found road unexpectedly good met with resistance except in passage of pass over mountain at melloon stanley be very glad to meet cousin again for th have be left in garrison there harry have be down again with sharp attack of fever be now recovering so be over stanley chance of earldom have nearly slipped through finger be glad indeed that be so stanley laughed in first place because must only have succeeded to at death in second place because have ambition whatever for title be not nineteen yet must greatly prefer to make own way than to find with nothing to do except to spend money a dropped into lap now that everything be settled that aracan have become english have seaport on tenasserim coast trade will increase tremendously may be sure that burmese will be only too glad to flock into province to live under fair rule to escape tyranny of own official uncle be just man to take advantage of new opening say that want to live out here life at rate hope by time be thirty to be able to come home for year holiday be just possible that by then may have grown into big firm that may establish headquarters in london instead of getting good from calcutta there be certain to be very big trade here in teak alone price in pegu be great deal below in india if have house in london must avoid having to pay commission perhaps get better price for wood of course uncle may by time think of retiring in case might have to stay somewhat longer out here know that like climate have heard say that a have very few acquaintance in england think that must prefer life in calcutta to one in london must not wonder if go home very shortly harry said last letter told that uncle be in failing health that must like to have at home with if next letter confirms that be afraid will have to resign commission exchange into regiment at home of course at death must have to leave army anyhow must be ridiculous for subaltern to be earl besides there be thing one must have to do suppose there be estate to be looked after sort of nuisance anyhow will always be glad have have share in expedition have learned what campaigning be must say that under such circumstance a have gone through be not quite so pleasurable a have expected half one friend be dead invalided home one never know when one wake in morning whether one may not be down with cholera before night fighting be well enough after take up very small portion of one time marching may say living generally in hot sweltering climate with six month of rain be not enviable work however have gone through one regular campaign that a severe one a british troop have ever performed above old man have met have come to be great friend have learned what one fellow will do for be sure be very glad to have gone through too have be fortunate indeed in never having be laid up for single day there be doubt that having served on staff will be of great advantage to even a trader own must like to have retired captain of course promotion have be tremendously fast owing to death vacancy have still two lieutenant over be sure to get step stanley have be in general order twice besides notice got for rescue also doctor say that number of men who have be sent down to coast be not likely to live many week a five of senior have be invalided may get step in natural course of thing at moment if be must ask for three month leave before rejoining regiment there will be difficulty about after have be upwards of two year in constant work general will certainly not refuse before end of time will have seen uncle talked matter over then if choose to resign commission can of course do so a be pretty sure to get step by death before end of three month a general despatch strongly recommend service may get brevet majority before resignation reach england man who have be mentioned two three time in despatch be specially recommended for honour be sure to get brevet majority directly get company on reaching rangoon stanley learned that two of invalid have died either on way down before must be put on board ship that one of major who have be sent to india for change four month before have also succumbed so that have already obtained company promotion must have be at other time extraordinary in campaign where engaged be carried off be nothing remarkable being still on headquarter staff embarked with sir archibald campbell still hold firm to determination to leave service captain brooke general said in course of passage to calcutta yes sir be sure that be best for think be brooke of course have be exceptionally fortunate in getting such rapid promotion still good business be great deal better than soldiering wrote very strongly in favour when sent off despatch day came down to coast be certain of brevet still be just a well that news of resignation must not get home before gazette come out with name in think best thing can do be to give leave for time a soon a get to calcutta be sure that deserve rest for work have be terribly heavy thank sir be just favour be going to ask will find out a soon a get there where uncle be join own mind be quite made up have certainly right to be consulted before take final step quite right feel doubt that opinion will agree with yours think that be showing good deal more wisdom than most fellow must do to give up service when have distinguished have much better chance than fall to lot of one man in hundred still there can be real doubt that man in good business out here can retire early go home with fortune while in army be liable at time after get to rank of colonel to be laid on shelf for year besides will be own master be more than anyone in army can say can go home when like for stay for permanency be not liable to have to run risk of campaign such a have be if one be sure of campaign think must possibly bring to leave service be probability of being kept for three four year at time doing nothing at calcutta madras decided general nodded be quite right brooke on active service soldier life be indeed stirring one there be nothing more dull monotonous than garrison life in peace time accordingly a soon a landed in calcutta stanley be put in order for absence on leave for three month learned from uncle agent that have heard from only few day before at chittagong that be then on point of leaving for aracan whither have ordered large consignment of good to be forwarded to by next ship three day later stanley started to join leaving address at aracan with sir archibald campbell in case there must be need to recall before three month leave expired vessel in be sailing carried consignment of good to uncle have therefore fear of finding that latter have left aracan before arrival meinik be still with have left army after last battle have be fought have travelled to spot where have buried money before embarking with stanley in canoe after absence of three day rejoined force on way down to rangoon stanley have long talk with a to future plan have only one plan master be to stay with a long a live will have plenty to live comfortably upon now meinik for after that have done for of course will arrange for to have sum will keep in comfort meinik shook head burma be bad country master after living with english must not go back to live under king officer in case money have must be squeezed out of before long master will go with unless drive from if do will go to chittagong live there think that will do certainly not meinik a long a be willing to remain with will be very glad indeed to have if at time wish to marry settle down on land of own will give five hundred pound be only small portion of sum ruby got band to give brought in daresay will marry meinik said will make difference a long a live will stay with meinik have be astounded at calcutta presented strong contrast indeed to city a burman have regarded a most important place in world burmese be fool master must have sent two three men here before made up mind to go to war if have be truly told what calcutta be like must never have ventured to make war with english chapter in business again when vessel arrived at mouth of aracan river canoe be seen coming out from akyah town situated at entrance to principal of several channel by river make way through number of sand bank island into sea a approached stanley recognized uncle sitting in stern well uncle how be called out a boat approached side what be stanley be glad indeed to see have watched paper anxiously to see if name appeared among who have be killed have died not seeing hoped that be right of course heard from madras regiment came across from sembeughewn that be over that troop must be shipped off a soon a went down to rangoon have not seen paper lately so have not have chance of learning news of fancied though that must be back at calcutta by time thought might get letter from by ship by time be on deck after hearty shaking of hand stanley asked what be doing here did not expect to see until got to aracan have be up there lad be decaying old place stream be in many place willow so that must be very difficult to take up ship of size foresee therefore that be going to be chief port of province timber will be floated down here rice brought down in native boat so will make headquarters here a far a district be concerned put johnson in charge doubt whether for time will do a much trade a will higher up coast everyone expects great burmese immigration large trade be likely to spring up in time have not quite determined on next move be not improbable that will go down in ship establish for time at martaban open trade in tenasserim if decide on will only get on shore portion of good take rest on with there now what be going to do stanley just what think best uncle must have thought that a speak language must be better for to go on to martaban for to work chittagong district up to assam then be going to stay with lad uncle exclaimed in tone of much satisfaction be afraid that must have got so fond of soldiering that must have thrown over altogether not bit of uncle be on three month leave at present at end of time will resign know be captain now be to say have got rank by death vacancy though until gazette come out from england can hardly be said to be pucka captain what be more general assured that after being mentioned in despatch two three time at strong commendation of service be sure of brevet rank of major uncle took off hat gravely must apologize to said for addressing a 'lad have idea that be full grown captain still that might soon be major care snap for title uncle stanley said laughing except that may be advantage to in place where there be garrison indeed generally where there be white official very great advantage stanley well lad have be coining money since saw at rangoon have be sending consignment of bullock down there week have done almost a much with manipur force have also got contract regularly now for supply of troop at calcutta other trade have of course be at standstill now that everything have quieted down there will be perfect rush have be sorely troubled in mind whether must be best to stay up here take advantage of to be one of first to open trade at new port of course if be ready to take martaban will decide will take passage in first ship going up to chittagong own boat dhow be there will at once work up river set thing going again have capital fellow native who be carrying on cattle business for at

to for there be buying up cattle without cash a generally have to wait two month after be shipped before get paid ready money be invaluable indeed must not have gone into thing on anything like same scale if have not be for money calcutta people must have helped to certain point must never have ventured upon such advance a required pound have doubled since met at rangoon calculate that store at

of british good at present be quite content to hing particular to ride drive about return call so on expect before very long will get restless want to be doing something however there be continent open to one decent hotel to stop at fever there burmese brigand month later have letter from mother have be written before of harry have be sent to calcutta thence to akyah have there lain until return two month later from boat journey up to pegu said how kind be of cousin to come in to give news of very day arrived in london of course be delighted with that told about made anxious to think of running into so many danger like very much must not help laughing because seemed quite concerned that must not have peerage instead of seems likely to come into soon for tell that earl be very ill say that must come down pay visit a soon a be master there know whether can be of course must be nice change believe that be very fine place said that must seem strange going there when there be lady that bachelor did not generally entertain said that in first place must have sister there who be about same age a girl that a be nearest relation be at present heir must be quite right proper thing for to come down seemed quite in earnest about must not be surprised if go three month later stanley heard that visit have be paid that have stayed fortnight there feel quite funny settling down here again after being in big house with servant grandeur not that there be grandeur about harry insists being relation that will call by christian name everything be delightful afternoon used to go driving of morning generally rode with girl have very pretty gentle horse for agnes gray pony beauty for kate have strong suspicion that have bought on purpose must not be surprised wo say anything about stanley puzzled over sentence be followed by sister be very nice girl be evidently something about harry said to possibly have taken idea into head that may fall in love with agnes certainly must be very nice thing suppose be anything more than idea of mother however four month later received letter from harry announcing engagement told mother that must let write by mail before did a be only right must have pleasure of telling news myself be splendid old man upon word know ought to feel most grateful to for saving life for getting to know sister seems to regular dispensation of providence did everything must to prevent from coming into title now sister be going to take be quite right that must come to be brother in law for be quite like brother already be to be married in spring how wish must be with absence will be only thing wanting to make everything perfect do hope mean to stay grilling out there many year seems to monstrous must be having estate big income sort of thing when have done nothing to deserve that must be toiling in beastly climate if thought that there be least chance of rushing home when get letter declare must put off marriage for month so so that must be here in time a feel sure that wo do anything of sort will be of use for to make such noble sacrifice stanley have received news that be gazetted brevet major month after be promoted to rank of captain two month before name appeared a having retired from army derived a expected much benefit from connection with army in position at three receiving port a placed on very pleasant footing with military civil official rendered occasional visit to calcutta madras exceedingly pleasant for in town found many officer whose acquaintance have made during expedition be always made honorary member of mess club during stay there business grew rapidly work of earlier year have so well paved way for larger operation that be able to more than hold own against other trader who after trouble be at end sought to establish at various point on western coast of peninsula after six more year of hard continuous work business came to be very large important one think more than probable stanley wrote to mother that before very long will be returning home uncle spoke about last time saw said that be outgrowing calcutta ought to establish in london 'we can hold on bit longer said 'but must come to sooner later when doe must be one to go to england take charge may go home before for few month have wish desire to stop there have now got good staff will probably fix permanently at calcutta ' two year later tom pearson on return from england brought back wife with established at calcutta stanley joined there three week after return have long talk together that evening see stanley uncle said that thing have gone on improving since have be away that turnover last year be pound profit close upon pound think now that be high time opened place in london have almost monopoly of teak trade in burma must be much more advantageous for to make purchase in england instead of here must save in carriage in trans shipment besides profit that people here make out of sale to have made great many inquiry at home a to price for cash in manchester birmingham find that must get good there fifteen percent cheaper than pay at calcutta even after putting on freight so see be important matter besides there must be better choice of good know exactly sort of thing that require quantity that can get rid of must be able therefore to send consignment month without waiting for advice from so must get thing just a readily a do now from here will give name of of firm have visited with whom have already paved way for opening extensive transaction during eighteen month have be away have learned about banking business will find more difficulty in managing in london than here brother in law netherly went with to bank of england introduced to one of director told that intended to open house in london that a soon a did so must open account with by paying in pound that must of course require facility probably not to large extent a payment for teak there must fairly balance export from england reckoned trade to be a minimum pound way matter be made extremely easy by netherly saying to astonishment can let draw what like mr townshend for will give personal guarantee up to pound remonstrated must not hear anything said 'ridiculous ' exclaimed hotly betanley be brother in law risked life for suppose must mind risking pound for 'not ' went on turning to director there be risk in matter know about business do in india that there be not shadow of risk in know that guarantee will be mere form a may put on better footing with to begin with will be very pleased to do ' of course know that there will be risk in greater portion of business be ready money one although of late have be dealing more with native local firm instead of selling direct from own store amount be never large so far have never lost penny of course will let know by mail how thing be going on at depot will then be able to form estimate a to amount of good will have to despatch to sending direct of course if there happens to be ship going thing of course will go into at length before start for england did go down to harry place yes stopped there week sister seems perfectly happy play part of queen of county admirably four youngster be jolly little thing a to mother will find very little change in really think that look day older than when saw off at calcutta something like ten year ago of course then be

position that occupied a one of authority in establishment of principal merchant on coast be fond of wife little child felt that to be established among stranger of different habit race must be very terrible for stanley bought nice house at rangoon a rate of pay have be gradually increased be now sufficient to cause to rank high among native population came to feel that have done wisely in
