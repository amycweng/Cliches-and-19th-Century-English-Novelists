evening of th enemy crossed that evening destroyed bridge during night british troop be brought up massed behind hill called serra hill stood upon sharp elbow river make just above town of oporto british be here completely hidden from marshal soult who have idea that be so close at hand indeed knowing that bridge be broken that boat have be carefully taken over to side of river marshal dreamt not that sir arthur must attempt to cross imagined that must take boat lower down near mouth of river there endeavor to cross to prevent such attempt soult have massed army below oporto troop be ordered to pile arm eat breakfast to keep in position wonder how be to cross river tom peter said be three hundred yard across with rapid current man in world must swim carry musket ammunition across expect sir arthur be reconnoitering peter saw go up hill to convent there must be able to see from there right over oporto hour passed then two three officer be seen coming down from hill one went up to general hill who happened at moment to be talking to colonel tritton be to prepare to cross sir colonel water have discovered small boat brought across by portuguese in night be going to cross to great convent see upon other side will bring back boat with will cross at once take possession of convent hold against force may be brought against until reinforcement arrive very quickly be order passed with smile of satisfaction men took arm fell in be moved near river kept under shelter of house keep near colonel tritton said to tom peter may want to carry message there will be sounding of bugle to day keeping under shade of tree so that must command view of river without being seen from opposite side colonel tritton with two of officer two bugler watched what be going on few pace ahead of be general paget hill like watching daring experiment behind under shelter of house be troop in dense mass ranger a first regiment in general hill division be in front must naturally be first to cross be most anxious moment a colonel water two portuguese pushed tiny boat from shore pulled across stream bulk of serra hill hid river at point even convent opposite from sight of french army formed up below town there be doubt straggler over city whole baggage of french army be in retreat by road to valarga ran at short distance behind convent most anxiously eye be strained upon opposite bank from expected to see flash of musketry a little boat neared convent however be a still a death behind heard rumble looking round saw eighteen gun on way up hill from eminence must command ground around seminary a convent across water be called thus afford aid to troop a crossed there be murmur of satisfaction a boat neared opposite shore after lying still for moment to reconnoiter convent pulled boldly up to landing place where occupant disembarked entered seminary absence be not long in few minute reappeared with eight ten men then at once entered cast off three large boat moored along side boy must hardly repress cheer a saw fairly under weigh officer now left side of general came to colonel tritton will get first company in readiness to embark sir let show until last moment colonel tritton joined men captain manley take company forward when first boat touch shore embark let there be noise confusion god bless peter tom said a separated company wo be many minute after for bugler of first company be ill tom be ordered to take place a boat touched shore captain manley ordered leading file of company to come from under cover take place in boat twenty four men entered when other boat be also full captain manley took place followed by bugler boat pushed off again there be dead silence in boat broken only by sound of oar a portuguese tugged manfully at oar being double banked by soldier rest sat with musket in hand pouch open ready for use eye fixed upon shore be quiet with sigh of relief hearty hurrah muttered under breath men leapt from boat ran up to seminary be large building with flat roof enclosure around be surrounded by high wall swept round to water edge on side only entrance be through stout gate studded with iron be already closed barred captain at once distributed men at upper window of seminary with order not to show until alarm be given have scarcely taken place when be joined by occupant of second boat while of third in general paget crossed be minute two later just a touched shore however there be sudden shout heard be followed by others in five minute wild hubbub be heard in town drum beat to arm be evident that enemy be at last awake to fact that british have effected lodgment upon side of stream will have hot presently captain manley said to tom will be quarter of hour before can get round here will have three boat back by time one came in be half way across already seven eight minute later heavy column of men be seen pouring out of upper gate of town a got into open ground threw out cloud of skirmisher pushed down towards convent heavy fire be at once opened upon by english gun upon serra hill there be longer need for concealment soldier in convent took place at window a did so must hear loud hurrah of comrade a crowded down to bank upon other side of river to await turn to embark before enemy be within musket shot three boat load more have be landed there be therefore men now in convent from gate of city french artillery came pouring out taking up position upon eminence opened fire upon convent just a infantry have got within musket range so suddenly did noise of enemy cannonade crashing of ball against thick wall of seminary rattle of enemy musketry louder roar of musket of defender blended on side with shout cheer break out that for minute two tom felt almost bewildered have time however to think for officer came up to captain general be up on roof want bugler sent up to captain manley nodded to tom who followed aide de camp on to roof here must see be passing exciting sight be crowd of french soldier be approaching wall keeping up tremendous musketry fire whilst behind three battery of field gun be sending messenger of death from upper window of convent answering flash came thick fast while overhead hummed shot from british gun on serra hill oporto be in state of uproar drum be beating trumpet sounding bell clanging while from house top population men woman be waving handkerchief to english gesticulating making sort of pantomimic expression of joy looking at river behind tom saw with pleasure that more boat have be obtained that strong reinforcement must soon be across whistling of bullet hum of round shot be incessant tom acknowledged to that felt horribly uncomfortable much more uncomfortable than have idea that must feel under fire have be actively engaged must have hardly experienced feeling to stand impassive under heavy fire be trying to nerve of oldest soldier be angry with that be not more indifferent to whizzing of ball sensation of discomfort under fire be beyond control of will be unusual thing to see young soldier who later in day may display almost reckless courage yet at first flinch whenever ball hiss close by in spite of effort to contrary tom be able however to control outward manifestation of feeling took place few pace behind general paget who be standing with one of officer by side watching force momentarily increasing be in spite of british fire making way onward towards gate be evident that general considered danger to be pressing a once twice looked back to see how quickly reinforcement be crossing river first time that did so eye fell on tom get behind big chimney lad there be use in exposing unnecessarily tom obeyed order with alacrity once in shelter be soon able to bring nerve under control to look round corner of shelter without flinching when bullet sang past in five minute general hill joined paget on roof just a did so latter be severely wounded fell tom ran forward to assist kneeling beside partially supported until four men came up carried below position of little garrison be now very precarious artillery fire concentrated upon be heavy french swarmed up to wall in vain endeavored to climb english kept up tremendous fire upon cheering constantly a fresh reinforcement arrived a enemy be momentarily repulsed tom have now lost nervousness be standing eagerly watching fight when ball knocked shako off general happened to turn around at moment be narrow escape said with smile what be name lad scudamore sir tom answered scudamore scudamore yes remember name now be one of lad general craufurd spoke to about want to see come to to morrow with brother go down now join company want here tom gladly went down for longed to be doing something soon found company taking up firelock of one of men who have fallen be soon hard at work loading firing into assailant for hour strife continued fortunately general murray have found boat three mile higher up stream have crossed thus menacing enemy line of retreat suddenly great pealing of bell be heard in oporto with shouting cheering house top be covered with people waving handkerchief french be evacuating town inhabitant at once took across large barge to villa suburb lying across river just below serra hill here sherbrooke began to cross be now time for english to take offensive there be now three battalion in seminary a french drew sullenly off to join column now flowing steadily out from oporto along valonga road gate be thrown open english passing out formed outside wall poured volley after volley into retreating foe have murray fallen upon flank disaster of french must have be complete general feared that enemy must turn upon destroy division before assistance must arrive therefore remained inactive allowed long column of fugitive to pas unmolested for next eight day english army followed hotly in pursuit several skirmish occurred soult effected most masterly retreat saving army when seemed upon brink of destruction by leaving gun baggage behind leading men by path over mountain supposed to be impassable for large body of men lost altogether men in short campaign included prisoner either captured in action left behind in hospital killed number of gun left behind be fifty eight english have only killed wounded sir arthur plan for invasion of spain be not yet complete accordingly halted army to await supply reinforcement during time young bugler have opportunity of calling upon major general hill transport supplied by spanish government have failed grossly troop be badly fed at time when taking long march most required support first day after halted boy determined that must a soon a be off duty call upon general hill while parade be going on however saw general ride up to colonel tritton enter into conversation with bugler who be standing near be ordered to sound call for officer to assemble in front when did so colonel tritton left general side spoke few word with there be short conversation then colonel rejoined general side officer returned to place colonel now rode forward to center of line said in loud tone men have piece of news to tell think that will be glad to hear upon arrival at lisbon reported gallant conduct of tom peter scudamore in rescuing one of comrade when washed overboard in bay of biscay captain merivale of latona also reported general hill when heard circumstance be also good enough to send home report recommending for promotion have received answer from commander in chief announcing that be granted commission in regiment a reward for act of distinguished gallantry regiment be dismissed a men fell out gave loud general cheer tom peter be surrounded by comrade who shook by hand congratulated upon promotion boy be too much surprised affected to speak have scarcely recovered from bewilderment when carruthers came up to led to colonel here general hill first then officer warmly shook hand with boy be much touched by warmth with be received be soon hurried off to tent of officer several of ensign be slight young men insisted upon rigging boy out in uniform boy have le scruple in accepting kind offer inasmuch a expected day to enter spain when baggage must be cut down to smallest possible proportion officer a well a men be obliged to leave almost everything behind sam be delighted at promotion of friend asked to be appointed servant request be at once acceded to regiment have now be three month in spain boy have continued to work hard at spanish devoting several hour day to study talking whenever must find opportunity difficult matter a portugal be full of spanish who have crossed frontier to avoid hated yoke of french delay in invading spain be caused partly from want of transport more by utter incapacity of spanish junta government by arrogance folly of cuesta spanish commander in chief who be always proposing impracticable scheme to wellington inflated with spanish pride obstinacy believed that own worthless troop be fully match for french be jealous in highest degree of british general at last on th of june british army advanced scarcely have made day march however when utter faithlessness of spaniard became manifest provision transport promised be not forthcoming from very day of advance british be badly fed indeed often not fed at so great be suffering during campaign suffering caused by heartlessness of people whom have come to deliver from foreign yoke that british soldier came to cherish deep bitter hatred against spanish be intense feeling of animosity have little to do with cruel excess of english soldiery upon capture of burgos san sebastian after many delay from cause british army reached oropesa upon th july there formed junction with cuesta army upon d allied army moved forward upon same day spaniard came in contact with french must have inflicted severe blow upon ignorance timidity of spanish general enabled enemy to draw off concentrate without loss british troop have now be for many day upon half ration sir arthur gave notice to junta that unless requisition be complied with must retire from spain cuesta however believing that french be retreating in haste pushed army across river alberche with vain idea of defeating entering madrid in triumph sir arthur seeing fatal consequence must ensue be spaniard attacked alone laid aside previously formed resolution put army in motion across alberche position of allied army be now most dangerous far more so indeed than english general supposed badly informed by spanish greatly underrated enemy force taking advantage of delay caused by want of provision carriage soult victor ney be marching force from various point concentrating to crush invading army upon th french met spanish army general zayas who commanded spanish advance of infantry cavalry scarcely offered resistance men broke fled in disorder panic must have spread to whole spanish army have not general albuquerque brought up more cavalry held french at bay while cuesta retreated in great disorder spanish loss by dispersion flight be le than men whole army must have be broken up have not general sherbrooke advanced with division placed between french flying spaniard ally now recrossed alberche took up position to cover talavera sir arthur chose strong defensive position a be evident that spanish be worse than useless in open field spaniard be placed with right resting upon left upon mound whereon large field redoubt be constructed front be covered by convent by ditch stone wall breastwork felled tree thus worthless a be troop must scarcely be driven from position almost impregnable line beyond spanish be continued by campbell division next to came that of sherbrooke left extending to steep hill mackenzie donkin have not yet fallen hack from alberche hill be in rear british troop including german legion be strong with thirty gun spaniard have men seventy gun spanish contingent must however be in way relied upon be indeed never seriously engaged real battle be between british troop french french attacked british outpost with great impetuosity mackenzie donkin be driven in with loss of men latter took up position with brigade on hill on sherbrooke left former took post with campbell division to belonged french cavalry now galloped up towards portion of line held by spanish discharged pistol at whereupon spanish infantry whole of artillery broke fled in wild confusion for mile continued flight in evening spanish cavalry be sent round in pursuit drove of coward back to line seeing wild confusion be raging on ally right victor resolved although evening be at hand to make sudden dash upon hill upon left held only by donkin brigade be key of position hill be very steep upon front french side while towards rear sloped gradually ruffin division be ordered to attack followed by villette in support while lapisse be ordered to engage german legion be on left of sherbrooke division hill division be lying down behind hill when ruffin troop advanced to attack there be expectation of attack that evening wood increasing darkness covered movement of french troop weary hungry english soldier disgusted at inhuman neglect of spaniard furious at cowardice be chatting over event of day discussing chance by mean bright of expected battle to morrow day have have food save small portion of grain served out raw unground tom peter have be chatting with officer who be grouped under tree when sambo came up to beckoned aside look here massa tom here six egg tree for tree for massa peter thank sam be capital know will get into row if get caught taking thing take massa old hen give to tom laughed how be that sam well massa saw sitting on nest went up

triangle if have be caught however a be rude to return present of course can not take back to hen suppose be raw yes massa good make fire make hole bofe end suck right sam be not nicest way under circumstance perhaps be best at rate be too hungry to wait till can get fire lighted so saying boy sucked raw egg then joined men when just a did so first dropping rifle shot then perfect roar of musketry broke out upon hill above needed order to be given men fell into place prepared to climb hill assist donkin brigade be evidently unable alone to resist attack knapsack be thrown off firelock tightly grasped regiment impatiently awaited order to advance none be more impatient than colonel who after few minute seeing by fire that english be falling back that french have gained crest of hill waited longer for order gave word for regiment to advance be way up hill when general hill galloped down to meet then turning led way beside colonel tritton general hill have have narrow escape donkin have repulsed french who attacked in front force be insufficient to guard whole crest of hill consequently enemy have come up round flank be now in actual possession of crest general hill ignorant of have ridden with brigade major right into midst of french before found out mistake brigade major fordyce be killed own horse wounded bridle seized by french grenadier have however broken away have ridden off under storm of bullet with cheer norfolk ranger followed gallant leader reached crest poured tremendous volley into enemy charged with bayonet french of whom small portion have a yet gained crest be unable to resist impetuous onslaught at once gave way ranger be now joined by th th so that with donkin brigade formed strong body of troop french who have fallen back now united with main body attack be renewed with force of ruffin division heavy mass pressed upwards in spite of destructive fire of british be within twenty yard of crest when with hearty cheer english troop burst upon with bayonet french again fell back broken disheartened ended fighting on th of july long line of bivouac fire soon blazed upon side wounded be carried down hill to field hospital have be erected under cover men eating scanty supper wrapped in great coat be soon asleep officer chatted for short time longer a be tired next day be sure to be severe one too soon lay down by fire when morning broke be seen that enemy have massed large force of artillery upon hill just opposite to one held by english soon afterwards ruffin division a before supported by villette advanced to attack covered by tremendous fire from artillery british have adequate force of artillery to reply to iron storm ball swept through line mowing down rank causing great loss regiment in reserve lay down to avoid iron shower while ranger th prepared to resist french when came within fighting distance a men approached summit of hill french artillery be obliged to cease playing in direction turned attention to british center while fierce musketry contest took place between french hill donkin men ground be rough troop on side broken up into small body fought desperately general hill be wounded british troop fell fast french however suffered even more a hill brought up reserve english gained ground foot by foot until drove again down steep side of hill a french retired artillery once more opened fire to cover retreat pause now ensued french in brief contest have lost men british have suffered severely french then held council of war determined to attack along whole line in force hour passed away english munched corn smoked pipe watched enemy scattered over plain weather be very hot men of side went down to little stream divided position drank filled water bottle in perfect amity of officer who spoke french conversed with french officer exchanged cigar for brandy joked laughed a if have be best of friend at one o'clock french drum be heard to beat men be soon formed in order tom peter stood with group of officer on brow of hill nothing must be finer than sight far away view stretched over country thickly wooded with chateau farm house scatted here there through tree dense mass of french must be seen a moved in column towards position from be to attack upon eminence nearly opposite to position boy must see long line of french artillery far away to right rose church of talavera while behind hill be british spanish cavalry ready to charge must french endeavor to turn british left by pushing round foot fifty pace from officer of norfolk ranger sat sir arthur wellesley on horseback watching attentively through field glass movement of enemy at short distance behind be staff british troop be standing in easy order little behind crest of hill so a to be sheltered from artillery fire with french be sure to cover advance of column of attack be grand sight peter tom said wish must begin make one fidgety waiting for scarcely have tom spoken when a if in answer to wish series of jet of white smoke puffed out from opposite hill two three second later came thunder of eighty gun whizzing sound of a many ball instinctively group drew back pace be not upon that tremendous fire be opened be directed against right of british line almost at same moment cloud of skirmisher appeared among tree followed by dark column of sebastiani division upon english gun at once opened fire rushing forward with usual impetuosity cleared away obstacle have be raised across british front charged with fury against british position campbell division however assisted by mackenzie brigade two spanish battalion stood firm driving back skirmisher advanced in line cheering loudly head of french column withered away under tremendous fire pushing forward overlapped drove back with terrible loss capturing ten gun then campbell prudently recalled men to first position british artillery have necessarily be silent while friend foe be mingled together opened furiously upon french a tried to re form upon support spanish cavalry regiment dashed down upon flank retired again in great disorder incident of fight must be seen from british position on hill troop almost held breath with excitement a british line clashed against head of french column loud shout of triumph burst out spontaneously a french broke fled be now turn of left already villette division preceded by grenadier supported by ruffin division be advancing british cavalry be ordered to charge ground be however quite unfit for cavalry colonel arentschild very experienced officer who commanded german hussar drew up regiment at edge of deep cleft crossed front refused to take men to certain destruction d dragoon however dashed into ravine men horse rolled over in direction still got across charging furiously between french infantry regiment poured in terrible fire fell upon brigade of chasseurs in rear victor sent up polish lancer westphalian light horse to assistance of chasseurs who already outnumbered d gallant regiment be completely broken survivor escaping to shelter of bassecourt spanish division lay beyond hill having lost men officer tom peter did not see disastrous affair for on approach of enemy column fell into place in rank be however in vain that french tried to gain crest of hill effort at point being indeed far more feeble than have be either in morning upon previous night be in center great effort be made here lapisse threw division against of sherbrooke covered by own artillery by gun upon hill charged right up to position british however repulsed guard carried away by excitement of moment followed with reckless ardor french reserve of infantry cavalry came up artillery plied british with shot shell fugitive rallied again came to attack guard fell back in confusion german next to severely pressed began to waver for time seemed that british victorious upon flank be yet to lose battle by being broken in center now however th sir arthur have ordered down from hill when saw rash advance of guard be seen advancing in line through disordered mass wheeling back allowed retreating regiment to pas through then again formed fell upon flank of victorious french column french paused in advance guard german rallied came back again to fight shot of british gun plowed line in column french wavered a british light cavalry trotted up with intention of charging fell back drew off to first position amidst shout of victory along whole length of british line thus battle ceased party occupying ground have held in morning british loss in killed wounded missing in two day fighting be that of french have british be in condition to have sallied from position pursued retiring enemy victory must have have far greater result exhausted half starved british be incapable of following up advantage next morning at daybreak french army quitted position retiring across alberche formed line of battle there awaited attack must english take offensive be in position to do although in course of day craufurd have come up with d d th regiment three regiment have heard of first day fighting from spanish fugitive have marched with speed to assistance of

spaniard be now more markedly shown than ever although in cuesta army in town of talavera provision be abundant yet inhabitant carefully concealed while wounded fighting men of british army be in want so great be misery indignation of soldier at shameful treatment from for whom be doing so much that must willingly have attacked spanish army plundered town from period to end of war british hated spanish with deep bitter hatred wellesley now received news that soult have crossed mountain through pas of banos have be left undefended by spanish be marching upon rear believing that soult have only men with whereas in fact have sir arthur left spanish army at talavera in charge of hospital with sick wounded retraced step with intention of giving battle to new enemy upon d however learned real strength of soult army upon same day heard that general cuesta have basely retreated from talavera without having provided transport according to promise for british sick wounded of who have strength to crawl rejoined british army who be unable to walk be left behind fell into hand of french by whom be treated with far greater kindness attention than have be by spanish upon th cuesta joined sir arthur at six o'clock next morning only possible course for safety be adopted victor be advancing from talavera soult be hurrying from placentia to cut off retreat of british accordingly sir arthur fell back upon arzobispo on tagus artillery baggage wounded first crossed bridge at two o'clock entire army be across so great be hunger of men that herd of swine happening to be seen close to line of march soldier ran upon shot bayoneted devoured raw taking up strong position guarding bridge of tagus british army remained quiet until end of august during time became so weakened by starvation that must scarcely walk great portion of cavalry horse nearly baggage animal died of hunger at last sir arthur finding that remonstrance availed with junta fell back again to portuguese frontier by slow march for army be so utterly enfeebled that resembled vast body of invalid rather than army of unbeaten soldier chapter viii pause in operation talavera be fought in july for four month longer sir arthur wellesley kept troop on spanish frontier where presence served a check against invasion even by very formidable army of portugal after utter bad faith cowardice shown by spanish great commander be determined never again to trust in promise to undertake movement dependent for success upon co operation junta then declared that spaniard must alone unaided sweep french beyond pyrenees spanish army of infantry cavalry gun advanced in november against madrid be met by french army of infantry cavalry gun battle began at eleven in morning by three french with loss of

carried with only dozen so little despatch done up in tiny roll of length about thickness of bodkin be sewn inside lining of coat in middle of cloth where be doubled in at seam so that even be clothes to be examined carefully felt over chance of detection be slight indeed have on starting dozen piece of spanish gold coin sewn between thickness of leather of sol of of shoe for did not start in beggar clothes in have first disguised clothes be indeed worn somewhat patched be of stout material wore shoe stocking have indeed appearance of spanish boy of peasant class weather in north of spain be often very cold in winter boy felt that with rag bare foot must suffer severely that have to say do have be learned by heart name address of agent of british government at town have be laboriously learned before starting a peter said ruefully be worse than dozen greek imposition at place of importance must find person to whom be instructed to apply must accost with password must be put up by while remained there when have gained intelligence required of number of french troop in place neighborhood knowledge always obtained by going round counting men on parade in case of small village finding out easily enough from peasant number quartered there must write report on number intention a far a must learn amount of food in store sentiment of population must enclose despatch in goose quill give to host who be responsible for forwarding in great number of case indeed man to whom be accredited be muleteer men hated french with hatred even more deep deadly than of other spaniard for in addition to national cause of hatred mule be constantly being requisitioned seized by troop forced to accompany army for long distance at nominal rate of pay for animal then too be in close connection with guerilla for whom carried good up into mountain from town when chance came must leave animal in mountain join in cutting off enemy convoy acted a messenger spy too took friend in hill early news of intended movement of enemy many day have boy traveled in company of muleteer merry careless fellow singing talking to mule apparently best natured of men until something must be said must recall hated foe then black eye must flash finger clutch knife handle must pour out long string of deep spanish oath great be surprise of men on receiving password from two boy never hesitated instant in taking in in giving hospitality a long a remained in accompanying to next town handing over to charge of comrade going in direction not even to did scudamores ever betray that be not what be taken to be two spanish boy employed by english commander a messenger often be questioned how english have come to entrust important communication to two boy reply always be that father mother have fled to portugal from french be living there near english line that have offered life in case of son treachery system of hostage seemed probable enough to questioner if boy fare be rather harder treatment more unceremonious than must have be have said that be british officer in disguise ran far le risk of detection from accidental word sign indeed must have be next to impossible for have desired to convince one of identity there be fear now of accent betraying since have left army have never even when alone together spoken in english made rule kept to for two reason one being that found that if did not get into habit of always speaking spanish might inadvertently address other in english thus betray second that wanted to learn to speak absolutely like native have in four month thoroughly learned to do at first pronunciation occasional mistake excited curiosity when asked question a to part of spain from have come constant communication with muleteer friend have quite removed for last two month not one person have doubted that be not only spanish that came from northern province hitherto have journeyed principally between large town over country held by french that part of work be finished have accurately computed number of army with massena be to advance shortly to besiege ciudad rodrigo have now to carry despatch to guerilla leader hitherto have not in single instance excited suspicion not frenchman have asked question adventure of anything like exciting nature have taken place be now however entering into country entirely different from have hitherto traversed northeast of spain be wild mountainous offer immense natural facility for irregular warfare through various pass of pyrenees lead road from france whether to vittoria on great road to madrid through navarre to catalonia here there fortified town still held out against french town of gerona in catalonia have only fallen after six month regular siege desperate defense fully rival that of saragossa be not little singular that spaniard who in open field be with few remarkable exception absolutely contemptible yet frequently defended town with wonderful fortitude courage desperation may indeed be said that in siege where spaniard be commanded by brave resolute chief behaved admirably great range of hill country be stronghold of guerilla convoy from france have to be protected by large force even then often suffered greatly from harassing attack of active enemy band of guerilla chief differed greatly in strength varying from merely ten dozen men to three four thousand indeed band varied continually men when not required must scatter to home cultivate little patch of ground throw down spade take up rifle again when heard of convoy to cut off invading column to beat back band too must vary in proportion to renown of chief energetic man who at head of handful have performed daring feat must find week afterwards leader of many hundred while chief who be slow dilatory must find band melt away like snow in summer character of warfare depended much upon character of french general few of kept troop under command sternly in hand must permit plundering insisted upon fair treatment of spaniard in turn wanted nothing better than to remain quietly in home guerilla band must melt away to nothing other general furious at savage nature of warfare incessant toil loss entailed upon troop allowed latter to do a pleased burning house dead body marked course then peasantry now turned guerilla retaliated a savagely giving quarter sacrificing prisoner putting wounded to death sometimes with torture on side horrible atrocity be committed guerilla be armed partly with rifle carbine partly with musket landed on coast by british government who also from time to time sent powder money to assist to continue resistance to french although nowhere really formidable yet being scattered over great extent of country band occupied very large body of french troop who must otherwise have be disposable for general operation in field english commander in chief have of course shadow of authority over guerilla indeed over of spanish troop communication to simply asked what arm ammunition required begged to send list of number of men must throw on french communication line of retreat in case must find in position to make general advance against also recommended most strongly bearer of despatch to care be to chief known a nunez that be now bound mule train be nominally destined for vittoria to town leader have got pas specifying number of mule nature of good

side of ravine slope be a steep sharp a of busaco so that opposite crest be within easy cannon shot enemy in order to attack british position must have to descend into bottom of steep ravine then climb up precipitous ascent to meet british soldier awaiting fresh unshaken at top so strong indeed be position that english general be doubtful whether massena must venture to attack upon th craufurd moved division forward must have repeated mistake of coa have not wellington gone forward recalled troop bringing off with difficulty in face of advancing mass of french by three in afternoon french

musketry rang over head then th wing of th dashed across with fierce cheer charged portion of column engaged in wheeling breathless in disorder from prodigious effort french be unable to resist fresh attack in instant british be among mixed up in wild confusion fighting hand to hand mass of combatant went mingled together down hill be success of french column have gained crest of long duration for leith brought up one of brigade colonel cameron with th regiment dashed at enemy with bayonet without firing single shot while th attacked flank french unable to resist onslaught relinquished position

battle of busaco be indeed one of secondary importance loss be not great on side although of french be fully threefold greater than of british a former be exposed during attack to grape shell of british gun while french gun afforded assistance to infantry french loss in killed wounded prisoner did not exceed of only be killed be strategical advantage gained by battle for french upon following day found road across hill to british left from martagoa through bonzalva throughout day made feint of renewing attack upon english position be not until late in afternoon long column of men be seen crossing hill to left wellington discovered that busaco have be won in vain for flank be turned there be nothing for to fall back upon torres vedras before night whole british army be in retreat what horrible scene of confusion tom remarked a marched into town of coimbra next day confusion captain manley said be enough to drive commander in chief out of mind here wellington have for week be endeavoring to get portuguese government to compel population to retire upon lisbon carrying can destroying mill burning corn must not carry off government did issue order have taken step to carry out although knew along must never repel invasion in open a be greater portion of poor wretch will lose posse might have carried off quietly enough during last two month many of will lose life will block

towards lisbon bullock cart carriage mule donkey horse be crowded together laden with aged child sick such property a be most portable valuable happily massena have circuitous detour to make road in

however have not arrived by night road be cleared troop passed on there be pursuit for massena allowed troop to halt plunder coimbra british by easy march fell back to torres vedras though unpursued disorder relaxation of discipline always mark retreat showed wellington be obliged to hang several plunderer to resort to other severe measure to restore to discipline that army only week before have repulsed best troop of france towards end of march french pressed again craufurd with light division have narrow escape of being cut off great be satisfaction of british troop when took up position so carefully prepared for equally great surprise of massena french army when beheld almost impregnable line of redoubt fortress of whose very existence have only heard confused rumor two three day before yet formidable a be chain of fort occupied by british be weak in comparison to second line five six mile in rear to wellington must have fallen back if driven from first position second position be indeed that have originally intended to have taken up redoubt on exterior range of hill being intended a outpost while massena delayed advance outside line of fortification have so grown increased in strength that wellington resolved to hold in first place there be therefore a will be seen by plan three line of defense first from alhandra on tagus to zizandre on sea coast following winding of hill be twenty nine mile long second main line be from quintella on tagus to mouth of san lorenza twenty four mile in length third intended to cover embarkation in case of necessity extended from passo d'arcos on tagus to town of junquera on coast massena spent day in surveying british position came to conclusion that be too strong to be attacked have order of wellington be carried out whole country wasted of provision french army must have made precipitate retreat to avoid starvation for have provision connection with spain wilson trant with portuguese levy hung upon rear captured coimbra where massena have left sick wounded in number upon very day after main french army advanced from town so vast be supply however left in country that massena be able to take up position first immediately in

staggered like sinking ship suddenly sternly recovering closed with terrible enemy then be seen with what strength majesty british soldier fight in vain did soult with voice gesture animate frenchman in vain did hardiest veteran break from crowded column sacrifice life to gain time for mass to open out on fair field in vain did mass bear up fiercely striving fire indiscriminately upon friend foe while horseman hovering on flank threatened to charge advancing line nothing must stop that astonishing infantry sudden burst of undisciplined valor nervous enthusiasm weakened stability of order flashing eye be bent on dark column in front measured tread shook ground dreadful volley swept away head of formation deafening shout overpowered dissonant cry broke from part of tumultuous crowd a slowly with horrid carnage be pushed by incessant vigor of attack to farthest edge of hill in vain did french reserve mix with struggling multitude to sustain fight effort only increased irremediable confusion mighty mass breaking off like loosened cliff went headlong down steep rain flowed after in stream discolored with blood eighteen hundred unwounded men remnant of six thousand unconquerable

day last day of month being very earliest date at according to calculation considerable body of french must come up to relief ciudad lie on rising ground on bank of agueda fortification be fairly strong being protected by very high glacis be difficult to effect breach in glacis be smooth ground outside ditch in well constructed work wall of fortification rise very little above ground beyond from be separated by broad deep ditch thus ground beyond ditch be glacis cover wall from shot of besieger render extremely difficult to reach in case of ciudad however there be outside place two elevated plateau called great small teson gun placed on must look down upon ciudad must therefore easily breach wall then be spot from wellington determined to make attack french however be aware of importance of position have erected on higher teson inclosed palisadoed redoubt mounting two gun howitzer great difficulty attending operation be that there be fuel shelter to be obtained on right

have grumbled rarely at discomfort when really engage in work of war however british soldier care for nothing holding up rifle pouch haversack to keep dry men crossed river laughing joking there be little done day for fire of enemy be too fast deadly for men to work under in daylight at night scudamores left horse with of divisional officer accompanied troop into trench to learn work have there to be done directly be dusk twelve hundred men fell to work to construct battery night be dark be strange to scudamores to hear thud of so many pick shovel going to hear now then low spoken order to see nothing save when flash of enemy gun momentarily lit up scene half minute so shot shell grape came tearing through air followed occasionally by low cry deep moan exciting a be for time boy having duty found difficult long to keep awake presently dozed off at first to wake with start whenever shell fell close presently to sleep soundly until dawn by time battery eighteen foot thick be completed on th fourth division on th third carried on work be nightly disturbed not only by heavy fire from bastion from gun french have mounted on convent of san francisco in suburb on left little be effected

for men to scramble up fallen rubbish to top order be therefore given for assault for night attack be to be made at four point simultaneously th th th be to attack from convent of santa cruz to make for ditch enter work way along to great breach mackinnon brigade of third division be to attack great breach from front light division posted behind convent of san francisco be to attack from left make way to small breach while false attack to be converted into real one if resistance be slight be to be made by pack portuguese at st jago gate at opposite side of town a night fell troop moved into position lord wellington went to convent of san francisco from whose roof must survey operation scudamores with rest of staff took up place behind suddenly there be shout on far right followed by sound of confused cheering firing while flash of flame leapt out along wall gun of place opened fire with crash now th th th rushed with great swiftness along ditch when at foot of great breach be met by third division together poured up breach roar of musketry be tremendous once at top of breach however made progress from trench have be cut beyond ring of fire broke out while musket flashed from window in house near be evident that serious obstacle have be encountered that main attack be arrested be terrible peter said a almost breathless watched storm of fire on around breach be thousand time worse than battle be awful to think how shot must be telling on dense mass can nothing be done hurrah there go light division at small breach tom exclaimed a french fire broke out along rampart in quarter violent cheer came up even above din from great breach answering fire light scene for major napier who commanded have forbidden men to load telling to trust entirely to bayonet there be delay here firing of french ceased almost immediately a with fierce rush men of light division bounded up ruin won top of breach for moment two there be pause for french opened so fierce fire from

there be perpendicular fall of sixteen foot bottom of be planted with sharp spike strewn with fragment of shell french have rolled down into have not be for light division coming up taking defender who occupied loopholed fortified house commanded breach in rear attack here must never have succeeded next few day be employed in repairing breach putting place again in state of defence a be probable that marmont might come up besiege french marshal however when hurrying to relief of town heard news of fall a weather be very bad for campaigning provision short fall back again to winter quarter believing that wellington must content with success make fresh movement until spring english general however be far too able strategist not to profit by supineness of adversary immediately ciudad rodrigo be taken began to make preparation for siege of badajos far stronger fortress than ciudad defended by strong detached fort three day after fall of rodrigo general hill came up with division to norfolk ranger now belonged scudamores have therefore delight of meeting old friend again saw little of however for be constantly on road to lisbon with despatch branch of service being now strained

making counter invasion of portugal on th of march army arrived at elvas on th pontoon bridge be thrown across guadiana following day british troop crossed river invested badajos with fifteen thousand men while hill graham with thirty thousand more moved forward so a to act a covering army in case french must advance to raise siege badajos be defended by five thousand men under general phillipson most able energetic commander who have in way strengthened defence put in position to offer obstinate resistance before attacking fortress be necessary to capture one of outlying fort known a picurina be selected because bastion of trinidad lay behind be weakest portion of fortress trench be commenced against on night of th although french made vigorous sortie work progressed so rapidly that be ready for assault on fort on th delay of two day having be occasioned by french taking gun across river swept trench rendered work impossible until division be sent round to drive in french gun invest fortress on side picurina be strong desperately defended be captured after furious assault lasted one hour cost nineteen officer three hundred men be not however until next evening that fort must be occupied for gun of town poured hail of shot shell into that permanent footing must not be obtained in gradually day by day trench be driven nearer to doomed city cannon of battery worked day night to establish breach soult be known to be approaching wanted to gather up available force a believed town capable of holding out for month at least still be approaching although three breach be scarcely yet practicable fire of town by mean overpowered wellington determined upon instant assault on night of th of april troop prepared for what turned out to be most terrible bloody assault in annals of

filled with tar combustible fell close to third division exposing rank forced to commence attack before hour appointed crossing rivillas by narrow bridge under tremendous fire third division assaulted castle although scaling ladder be over over again hurled down stormers at last obtained footing rest of troop poured in castle be won similar more rapid success attended assault on san roque be attacked so suddenly violently that be taken with scarce resistance in mean time assault upon breach have commenced be best to give account of terrible scene in word of eloquent graphic historian a picture be one of most vivid be ever drawn time tumult at breach be such a if very earth have be rent asunder central fire bursting upwards uncontrolled two division have reached glacis just a firing at castle commenced flash of single musket discharged from covered way a signal showed that french be ready yet stir be heard darkness covered breach hay pack be thrown ladder placed forlorn hope storming party of light division five hundred in descended into ditch without opposition then bright flame shooting upwards displayed terror of scene rampart crowded with dark figure glittering arm be on one side on other red column of british deep broad be coming on like stream of burning lava be touch of magician wand for crash of thunder followed with incredible violence storming party be dashed to piece by explosion of hundred of shell powder barrel for instant light division stood on brink of ditch amazed at terrific sight then with shout that matched even sound of explosion men flew down ladder disdaining aid leaped reckless of depth into gulf below at same moment amidst blaze of musketry dazzled eye fourth division came running in descended with like fury there be only five ladder for two column be close together deep cut made in bottom of ditch a far a counter guard of trinidad be filled with water from inundation into watery snare head of fourth division fell be said above hundred of fusilier men of albuera be there smothered who followed checked not a if such disaster have be expected turned to left thus came upon face of unfinished ravelin being rough broken be mistaken for breach instantly covered with men yet wide deep chasm be still between rampart from whence came deadly fire wasting rank thus baffled also commenced rapid discharge of musketry disorder ensued for men of light division whose conducting engineer have be disabled early whose flank be confined by unfinished ditch intended to cut off bastion of santa maria rushed towards breach of

held very strong fort overlooking guarding city fort held out desperately british battering train be weak upon d marmont having received considerable reinforcement advanced to raise siege wellington however refused to be tempted to leave trench to deliver general battle faced enemy with portion of army while continued siege marmont upon part believing that fort must hold out for fifteen day put off attack a knew that large reinforcement be coming up calculation be frustrated by one of fort taking fire on th when assault be delivered whole of fort surrendered marmont at once fell back across

be needed for advance a be quite uncertain whether french be pushing on through open country towards canizal whether be following direct road from toro to salamanca evening closed in sign of french army be seen party halted about six mile from toro small party of cavalry be despatched right left to scour country find out where enemy have gone be very strange where french can have got to be remark made for fiftieth time among staff detached party returned bringing news whatever lord wellington again advanced slowly cautiously towards toro small party be pushed on ahead presently officer rode back with news that have be a far a river that not frenchman be to be seen be too late to do more remained in uncertainty whether enemy have recrossed river after making demonstration whether

picketed horse round scudamores who have be more than twenty four hour in saddle wrapped in cloak stretching on floor be soon asleep just at midnight sound of horse footfall approaching at gallop be heard officer who have ridden without drawing rein from canizal dashed up to farm five minute later whole party be in saddle again news be important indeed marmont have drawn whole army back across toro on night of th have marched to tordesillas crossed there in afternoon after march of fifty mile have fallen upon cotton outpost driven across trabancos not moment time be lost by wellington after received news unfortunately six precious hour have already be wasted owing to despatch not having reached at canizal with three brigade of cavalry set off at once towards alaejos while officer be despatched to canizal to order fifth division to march with speed to torrecilla de la orden six mile in rear of cotton position at castrejon four hour riding brought to alaejos where halt for two

wellington beresford staff with sword drawn be in midst of fight friend foe be mingled together when leading squadron of cavalry from alaejos came thundering down very few of frenchman who have made that gallant charge escaped to tell tale mist be now rapidly clearing up in short time whole french army must be seen advancing moved towards british left wellington ordered troop at once to retire british fell back in three column marched for guarena through torrecilla de la orden french also marched straight for river now one of most singular sight ever presented in warfare be to be seen hostile army be marching abreast column being few hundred yard apart officer on side waving hand to other for ten mile army thus pressed forward officer urging men straining nerve to get first to river from time to time artillery of side finding convenient elevation must pour few volley of grape into opposing column position of two army did not often admit of gradually cotton men fresher than french who have in two previous day marched fifty mile gained ground reaching river marched across by ford winner of great race by so little that one division halted for moment to drink be swept by forty piece of french artillery arrived on spot almost simultaneously with on guarena british found remaining division of army have be brought up from canizal checked marmont in attempt to cross at vallesa while th th regiment with desperate bayonet charge drove carier french division back a attempted to push forward beyond castrillo thus two army faced other on guarena marmont have gained

next morning army be arranged in two line ready for combat at daybreak however marmont moved army up river crossed at ford there marched straight for salamanca thus turning wellington right threatening communication british at once fell back scene of previous day be repeated army marching along crest of two parallel hill within musket shot distance of other time however french troop although have marched considerably farther than english proved best marcher when night fell have mortification of seeing in possession of ford of huerta on tormes thus securing for marmont junction with army be approaching under king joseph also option of fighting refusing battle wellington felt position seriously threatened sent off despatch to spanish general castanos stating inability to hold ground probability that must be obliged to fall back upon portugal letter proved cause of victory of salamanca for be intercepted by french marmont fearing that wellington must escape prepared at once to throw upon road to ciudad rodrigo thus cut british line of retreat in spite of positive order have received from king joseph not to fight until arrived with army upon st army crossed tormes french at alba huerta british at aldea lengua san marta upon day news reached wellington that general chauvel with cavalry gun must reach marmont on evening of d morning of d english general therefore resolved to retreat unless marmont must by mistake give chance of fighting to advantage close to british right french left be two steep rugged hill called hermanitos brother soon after daybreak on d french seized upon one nearest to while british took possession of other then watching other two army remained until noon for wellington must not commence retreat by daylight long cloud of dust along road to ciudad rodrigo showed that baggage of army be already en route for portugal marmont now determined to make bold stroke to cut off wellington retreat although troop have not yet arrived ordered maucune with two division to march round by left menace ciudad road be at three o'clock in afternoon wellington who have be up night thinking that marmont must make move that day have gone to lie down for hour two when tom scudamore who from elevated point be watching movement of enemy hurried in with news that french be pushing left round towards ciudad road wellington leaped to foot hurried to high ground where beheld with stern satisfaction marmont in eagerness to prevent british escape have committed flagrant error of detaching wing from main body instantly issued order for attack great mass of men upon british hermanito moved down upon plain to attack maucune in flank while third division be ordered to throw across line of march to attack in front a advance across plain must be taken in flank by fire from french hermanito general pack be ordered to assail position directly british line have passed marmont standing on french hermanito be thunder struck at beholding plain suddenly covered with enemy tremendous fire be at once opened upon advancing british officer after officer be despatched to hurry up french troop still upon march when marmont saw third division dash across maucune path be upon point of hurrying to spot when shell burst close to be dashed to earth with broken arm two deep wound in side thus at critical point of battle french army be left without head be just five o'clock when pakenham with third division fell like thunderbolt upon head of maucune troop taken by surprise by attack on part of enemy whom have thought to see in full flight yet fought gallantly strove to gain time to open out into order of battle bearing onwards however with irresistible force third division broke head of column drove back upon support meanwhile battle raged along line in plain fourth division carried village of arapiles drove back bonnet division with bayonet fifth division attacked maucune command in flank while pakenham be destroying front marmont be succeeded in command by bonnet who be also wounded clausel able general took command reinforced maucune with own division have just arrived for while restored battle then past right left of pakenham

unsuccessfully to carry french hermanito by assault with portuguese division fate of battle be again in balance british division outnumbered outflanked began to fall back general cole leith spry be wounded french cavalry threatened flank of line wellington however have still plenty of reserve in hand at critical moment launched at enemy sixth division be brought up from second line hurled at center of enemy in fierce prolonged charge while light first division be directed against french division be descending from french hermanito against of foy while seventh division spaniard be brought up behind first line against so tremendous assault a french must make stand be pushed back in ever increasing disorder to edge of forest where foy maucune division stood at bay covered retreat in fast gathering darkness wellington believed that must capture great portion of beaten army for relied upon castle of alba de formes commanding ford at place being held by spaniard have evacuated place on preceding day have not even informed wellington that have done so thus hidden by night french retreated with slight loss from pursuing column in battle french have forty two thousand men seventy four gun ally forty six thousand sixty gun of infantry division be composed of spaniard must not be relied upon in way be probably most rapidly fought action ever known french officer described a defeat of forty thousand men in forty minute french loss be over twelve thousand in killed wounded prisoner so completely be dispersed that clausel week afterwards must only collect twenty thousand to standard be great victory celebrated a first wellington have gained over french for although at talavera busaco have repulsed french attack be not in case in position to do more than hold ground throughout short desperate fight scudamores have be fully engaged in conveying order from one part of field to shot shell flew around in direction yet when met at end of action found that have escaped without scratch day following battle pursuit began have king joseph advancing army united with clausel broken troop must have opposed wellington advance with force far superior in number to defeated at salamanca joseph after hesitating fell back in one direction clausel retreated in opportunity for concentration be lost wellington found foe to bar way on triumphant march upon madrid joseph fell back

deadly hatred with have inspired guerilla chief nunez when first rode into town indeed have spoken of one to other have agreed that must be pleasant to be able to walk through street without fear of

doubt whether security from hatred of guerilla be a complete a have fancied be sitting with number of other officer in large cafe in puerta del sol principal square in madrid when girl came round

careful in future peter avoid quiet street after dark keep sharp look out at time will get knife between rib a sure a fate time however passed on without anything occurring to give support to suspicion must not discover that be being watched footstep dogged nevertheless continued to be to certain extent upon guard after dark in daytime number of english soldier about street be so large

one by night other by day sam passing day sleeping in wood master traveling by day at night sleeping in wretched village posadas too must far rather have slept in wood for insect filth made sleep almost impossible in place besides ran good deal of risk a to discovery of disguise have however chosen inn in hope of hearing something might give clue a to object of search only information have gained be to effect that nunez still have quarter at old place have be driven out of village have be burned by french position be convenient one house have be cleared roughly roofed with bough of tree straw band be still there much be satisfactory must hardly have expected to learn more unless have happened to meet of member of band have not traveled by main road a upon large force of french be collected even if tom must have passed through boldly sam must not have made way even by road have chosen tom have met several body of french while at vittoria very large force be assembling destined for relief of burgos sam have few incident to relate have be carefully instructed by tom before starting a to road must take position distance apart of town village upon have traveled only at night have once twice exchanged word with passer by people did not travel much at night in so disturbed country when sam heard foot passenger approaching a be more frequently case party of french cavalry left road lay down until have passed one two foot passenger have met suddenly have passed with usual spanish muttered salutation darkness disguise prevented recognition of color now sar sam said when have finished breakfast what be to be done next think sam that party who have got peter have arrived yet must only have started on day that did have a long road to go most likely have got bullock cart wo travel more than fifteen mile day at outside have got peter in cart covered up with something may be sure think will be here for day so at earliest if knew what sort of cart be must attack on way

wellington if hear pistol shot hear shout beam will know be caught must make off a hard a can to that small town in plain where there be french garrison ask for commanding officer show letter offer to

fallen go off to bed even if walked boldly about place must likely enough meet one night that evening tom entered village a soon a be fairly dark knew from former experience sentry be always placed at point whence must get view of road made way so a to avoid risk of observation by when reached place whence must in turn view post of watcher found that be deserted concluded that brigand have become careless from belief now french have once destroyed village must not be likely to come up to search for there second time besides might reckon that french have hand much too full with advance of allied army to spare men time in raid upon guerilla in particular indeed must have argued wrongly for french during whole war however much be pressed by wellington always kept sufficient force in hand to scatter guerilla a fast a become formidable tom have now taken off beard wig have put on small whisker be general fashion of wearing hair throughout spain thus trusted if surprised in dark to pas a one of band so quiet be village when entered that at first thought be deserted at last however saw light in one of house in center of village approaching carefully noiselessly saw group of five men sitting drinking round fire made on ground in center of one of windowless room smoke finding way out through roof tell one said be getting sick of life be ready to go kill french to be left up here

sam watched night without hearing sound of vehicle in morning saw that several more guerilla have come in during night in morning party of two three began to come in from direction of vittoria be evident from shouting noise in village that brought satisfactory news of kind in afternoon most of went out again in body to wood at foot of hill soon afterwards sam saw cart coming along across plain two men walked beside sam must see one if not two more perched upon top of load three others walked along at distance of fifty yard ahead a many more at about same distance behind must see others making way through field dis berry bad job sam said to berry much afraid dat massa tom not get back in time der too many for sam to fight by must do someting whereupon sam set to to think with might presently burst into broad grin sure enough dat do said now let arrange about what dey call de pamerphernalia first emptied out content of couple of dozen pistol cartridge wetted powder rolled up in six cartridge like squib three short one three much longer then opened tom kit took out small box of paint tom have carried with for making dark line on face in other way to assist disguise taking white paint sam painted eyelid up to eyebrow circle on cheek giving eye at short distance appearance of ghastly saucer dat will do for de present said now for business if dey wait till get dark right if not sam do for nunez two three more den go down with massa peter then carefully examining priming of pair of pistol carried very pistol given to peter by passenger of marlborough coach prepared to set out be now six o'clock calculated that waggon must by time have mounted hill reached village have already collected large heap of dry stick log at point tom have pointed out now lit then started for top of hill looking back just a reached crest must see knowing where be very light smoke curling up over clump of tree intervened between fire be so slight that be convinced that must not be noticed by ordinary observer sam saw at once on reaching top of hill that guerilla be crowded round waggon stood at edge of small clump of tree in middle of village moment be favourable at once started forward sometimes making detour so a to have shelter of tree sometimes stooping behind low stone wall until reached first house in village be now comparatively easy work for there be enclosure wall patch of garden ground be breast high with weed stooping crawling sam soon reached house close to waggon be mere hut have not be repaired roof be gone charred shutter door still hung on hinge be very place from to see without being seen sam entered by door from behind found that through slight opening in window shutter must see be going on fifty guerilla be standing sitting in group at distance of twenty yard in centre of group lying on ground be figure at once recognized a peter be wound round round with rope beside stood rather danced nunez pouring forth string of abuse of threat of curse enforcing with repeated kick at motionless figure de debil muttered sam neber able to stand dis if not stop dat massa nunez put bullet through dat ugly head of yours a sure a stand dere must do till last ting for whether kill not be up with massa peter if once fire fortunately be tired in short time desisted threw down on ground take off rope one of said there must be fear of running away have three four day to live instead of a many hour take gag out of mouth throw water over to bring round pour wine down throat want to be fresh so a to be able to enjoy pleasure have in store for now let have dinner sam felt that for hour at least peter be safe therefore with same precaution a before crept away from hiding place through village over hill crest to place where have made fire log be burning well gave out little smoke sam looked at sky dusk cum on berry fast said hour massa tom come on with soldier if see fire hurry up sharp so saying sam heaped on pile of wood then made way back knew that tom must not approach until be too dark for movement of troop to be seen by look out that must not be expected to reach village until fully hour after dark just hour half said to ebery thing depend upon what happen before dat time be quite dusk before regained shelter of cottage have gone round by wagon have taken from large stable fork muttering a did so golly dis de berry ting close by saw carcase of bullock guerilla have just slaughtered from cut off horn tail when sam peeped out through shutter saw that something be going to be done be sitting smoking cigarette with look of savage pleasure in face while men heaped up large fire in front of tree like dat gentleman look sam said to be time dis chile begin to dress for de pantomime dat quite plain massa tom get here too late thus saying sam began to deliberately undress peter arm foot still bound be sitting with back against tree watching what be be convinced preparation for death for last ten day have lived in sort of confused painful dream from moment when upon entering room two hand suddenly gripped throat others thrust gag in mouth then blindfolded while one from behind lashed arm to side then altogether lifting like log carried downstairs threw into cart have not till now seen anything bandage have never be removed from eye cord from limb sometimes have be made to sit up soup wine have be poured down throat piece of bread thrust into mouth then have be again gagged thrown into cart over brushwood fagot have be piled there have lain until at night stop be made when be taken out fed then thrust back again covered over from first have never doubted who be captor what be destination therefore experienced surprise when on arrival at village on bandage being taken off eye saw where be that be useless to beg for mercy of savage into whose power have fallen knew well enough looked a calm indifferent a if did not hear word of threat imprecation nunez be heaping on see that fire enraged guerilla said there will be roasted english pig that be not yet that be too quick death here said to follower make little fire by side of big one there under arm of tree put on plenty of green leaf will smoke pig bit before roast peter still eyed unflinchingly be determined that pain must wring complaint prayer for mercy even now did not quite despair for thought that have just one chance of life be sure that tom must move heaven earth to save reckoned that must at once guess who have carried off with what object felt that tom must be certain to set off to rescue have reflected over in long day of weary suffering from moment that be unbandaged propped against tree have listened attentively for unusual sound how tom must rescue did not see be so utterly crippled from long confinement that knew that must be hour perhaps day before must walk step yet still thought possible that tom might try feared more than hoped for trembled lest if tom be really there that must do rash thing must involve in fate whether tom be here not peter thought a looked unflinchingly at nunez one thing be certain if know brother will not have many day to live after for tom will follow over spain will avenge at last such be peter thought so likely did think that tom be present that be scarcely surprised when heard a from ground behind well known voice massa peter keep up heart sam here massa tom be here in half hour with french soldier if dey go to kill before dat sam play dem trick can run massa peter if cut de cord sam dat bad job neber mind massa peter keep up heart sam keep quiet a long a can when de worst come sam do de trick right show sam must only cost life must help besides must put on guard wo kill yet will smoke so on will make last a long a can peter be able to say for at moment nunez be occupied in rolling lighting second cigarette peter received answer for sam seeing guerilla bringing stick leaf to make fire a nunez have ordered crept back again into deep shadow behind fire be now giving out volume of smoke guerilla climbed up tree slung rope over three others approached peter heart beat rapidly be with hope not fear knew from word of nunez at present be not going to be burned a guessed to be hung over smoke until be insensible then brought to life again with bucket of water only to have suffocation repeated until pleased nunez to try fresh mode of torture be a imagined rope be attached to leg amid cheer of guerilla two men hauled upon other end until peter swung head downwards over fire there be flame dense volume of pungent smoke rose in face for moment eye smarted with agony then choking sensation seized blood seemed to rush into head vein to be bursting there be confused din in ear last throb of pain then be insensible that be enough for present nunez said cut down men advanced to do so paused with astonishment for from behind great fire be loud yell yah yah yah louder than last then leaping through flame appeared a supposed devil sam appearance be indeed amply sufficient to strike horror in mind of band of intensely superstitious men have entirely stripped with exception of sandal have retained in order to be able to run freely on head be two great horn in one hand held fork in other what appeared to be tail really belonged to slaughtered bullock from month horn end of tail poured volume of fire arising need not to say from squib have prepared great white circle round eye added to ghastliness of appearance seeing terrible figure leap apparently from flame be wonder that scream of terror rose from guerilla spanish peasant may believe about saint angel belief yet more implicitly in devil black with horn tail here be with appendage tipped with fire who be able turned fled in terror who be too frightened to run fell on knee screamed for mercy while one two fell insensible from fear taking squib from mouth giving one more startling yell to quicken fugitive sam made two stride to where peter be hanging cut rope lowered down nunez have at first joined in flight looking over shoulder saw what sam be doing rage frenzy at thought of being cheated of victim even by evil one overcame fear rushed back shouting be mine be mine wo give to fired pistol almost in sam face ball carried away portion of one of sam ear with yell even more thrilling than have given before plunged pitchfork into body of guerilla then exerting immense strength lifted upon a if have be truss of straw took three step to great bonfire cast brigand into there be volume of spark tumbling together of big log most cruel of spanish guerilla have ceased to exist awful sight completed discomfiture of guerilla hearing chief shout sound o pistol have looked round sight of gigantic fiend casting into fire be too much for with cry of horror fear continued flight few of who have fallen on knee gained strength enough from fear to rise fly rest lay on face sam saw that for present be clear lifting up peter still insensible body a if have weight whatever turned went at brisk trot out of village then over crest down towards fire then heard ring of metal in front of voice said qui vive while voice said be that sam bress de lord massa tom dis be sure enough what be much better here be massa peter thank god tom said fervently be hurt why speak peter right massa tom talk in minute two now smoke choke better presently here massa take down to fire pour little brandy down throat now massa officer lead de way back to village a tom took peter in arm sudden fire of musketry be heard down on road fellow have got jules said know what have alarmed be running away push forward general reynier said give quarter jules keep by negro see that come to harm men might mistake for guerilla night be pitch dark extraordinary appearance of sam must not be perceived until after scouring village shooting few wretch whom found there gathered round fire before reaching however sam have slipped away for moment into hut where have stripped here quickly dressed removed paint from face rejoined group who be not little surprised at seeing black face in short time party who have be posted on various road came in be found that have between killed thirty forty of brigand have brought in two three prisoner have killed taken nunez general reynier asked work be only half done if scoundrel have escaped have asked prisoner one of officer said tell extraordinary story that devil have just thrown into fire what do mean by such folly a that general asked angrily be making fun of sir be certainly serious enough over be running for life when fell into hand have be horribly frightened at something ask that fellow there general said pointing to prisoner who have be brought in by detachment can not have spoken to others man be brought forward then jules asked in spanish what be running away for man gave glance of horror at fire devil came with pitchfork fire came out of mouth tail horn be tipped with spark captain fired at of course bullet did good devil put fork into carried to fire threw in jules of other young officer burst out laughing general said humph can easily prove portion of story see if there be human remains in fire wind be blowing other way a sergeant went up to fire in obedience to general order said there be great smell of burnt flesh here sapristi yes a tossed over log with foot there be body here sir pretty well burnt up be curious story general said where be that negro perhaps can enlighten sam have already left to look after peter jules put fellow against wall give volley then march men down to wood where horse be will bivouac here for night party now brought up peter who have quite come round be unable to stand indeed to move arm so injured be by rope have completely cut way into flesh however be cheerful bright able really to enjoy supper be soon prepared that done general reynier said captain scudamore will call black man when have finished supper doubt need want to tell took place before arrived prisoner be full of cock bull story that devil have stuck fork into captain pitched into fire story be corroborated at least to extent of fact that on turning fire over found body there sam called questioned told whole story tom translated a went on to french officer be received with chorus of laughter at thought of oddity of sam appearance of brigand terror with warm admiration for able stratagem courage shown by black tom be delighted peter who have until now be entirely ignorant of manner in have be saved feebly pressed sam hand said few word of gratitude thanks so delighted sam that retired to cry quietly next day moved down to vittoria where peter be tenderly nursed by madame reynier week later be fit to sit on horseback next day after hearty affectionate parting started to rejoin own army be now dressed a spanish gentleman jules with four trooper accompanied a escort made long detour to avoid french army in field under clausel at last came within sight of british outpost here jules escort halted after warm embrace with merry young frenchman rode forward after usual parleying with picket be passed forward to officer commanding post happened to be well known to after first surprise few word of explanation rode on towards head quarter of army besieging burgos chapter xix vittoria general clausel fell back a wellington advanced to burgos british laid siege to castle of place like wellington siege be commenced with wholly insufficient train of artillery without time necessary to carry out regular siege operation considerable portion of army be posted so a to watch clausel place be badly fortified french under governor dubreton defended with immense skill courage english assault be repulsed successful sortie be made by garrison at last after failure of fourth assault siege be given up allied army turned face once more towards portugal be time operation in south upon wellington have relied to keep at least portion of french force engaged have failed signally french general be bringing up troop from part of spain general souham having under general clausel maucune foy with force far superior to of british advanced to give battle then wellington whose anglo portuguese troop be much weakened by sickness fell back rapidly sending order to general hill who commanded troop left behind in madrid to evacuate city to fall back unite with on tormes be only by masterly maneuvering stiff fighting at venta de pozo on carrion on huebra that wellington drew off army to ciudad rodrigo during retreat british suffered very severely discipline of army became greatly impaired so much so that lord wellington issued general order rebuking army saying that discipline have deteriorated during campaign in greater degree than have ever witnessed read of in army without unusual privation hardship long march number of straggler may be imagined by fact that loss of allied army be upwards of nine thousand of whom not more than two thousand be killed wounded at burgos in combat during retreat number includes spanish a well a anglo portuguese loss be beginning of december when allied army reached winter quarter around ciudad rodrigo be fortunate that season of year necessity french have to refill magazine collect food gave breathing time rest to british although strengthened by junction with hill by arrival of reinforcement from coast wellington be not in position to have made stand against force a french must have brought against tom peter scudamore have rejoined army at hottest part of siege of burgos have taken up work at once lord wellington heard from tom brief account of what have taken place said few kind word expressive of pleasure at having escaped from so great peril grave preoccupied a be with position of army yet laughed at account of scare sam have given guerilla among friend nothing be talked of for day two adventure time be stirring however one event rapidly drove out sam became greater favorite than ever among officer of staff while orderly be never tired of hearing how pretty nearly frightened band of guerilla to death by pretending to be evil one in person next four month be passed in preparation for grand attack with wellington confidently hoped to drive french out of spain news of defeat of napoleon in russia have cheered heart of enemy of france excited to make great effort to strike decisive blow french army be weakened by withdrawal of several corp to strengthen army napoleon be raising for campaign in germany british gold have be so freely spent that portuguese army be now in really efficient state portion of spanish army have be handed over to wellington be now in far more trustworthy condition than have be heretofore while whole of north of spain be in state of insurrection french in spite of effort be unable to repress invasion be delayed until end of may in order that crop might be in fit state for subsistence of cavalry baggage animal in last week in month be ready in several column allied army poured into spain nearly hundred thousand strong french ignorant alike of wellington intention preparation be in position to stem effectually mighty wave of war be driven headlong before with many fierce skirmish until scattered force be for most part united on ebro here joseph occupied strong position thought to hold until whole of troop must come up wellington made detour swept round right french fell back in haste took up position in basin of vittoria where store baggage have be carried off a army retreated from madrid valladolid burgos other town be collected at vittoria be gathered court enormous mass of fugitive a spaniard who have adhered to cause of joseph have with wife family accompanied french in retreat hence accumulation of baggage animal cart of store of description of magazine of food artillery of helpless frightened people be enormous for retreat of army in case of defeat there be one good road already encumbered with baggage fugitive terrible accumulation arose partly from fault of joseph who be wholly unequal to supreme command in emergency like present confused bewildered by urgency of danger have hesitated wavered lost precious time by resistance at of river wellington have passed unopposed might easily have gained few day thus have allowed time for great mass of fugitive to reach french frontier for foy clausel of whom be within day march upon day of battle to have arrived with reinforcement of good fighting men instead of have suffered to be outflanked day after day army forced into retreat without effort at resistance course of action irritating disheartening to troop especially to french who admirable in attack be easily dispirited be ill suited to defensive warfare position have now chosen for battle on kingdom be to be staked be badly selected for action front be indeed covered by river zadora be crossed by seven available bridge none of have be broken down while there be one good line of retreat besides being already encumbered with baggage wagon must be easily turned by ally french army weakened by men who have marched upon preceding day in charge of convoy for france be still about strong ally british portuguese spanish about french be strongest in artillery wellington seeing that joseph have determined to stand at bay made arrangement for battle on left graham with men be to attempt to cross zadora at gamara mayor when must find on main road behind vittoria so cut french line of retreat hill with like force be to attack on right through defile of puebla so entering basin of vittoria to threaten french right obtain possession of bridge of nanclares in center wellington with troop must force four bridge in front of french center attack main position at daybreak on st of june weather being rainy with mist troop moved from quarter on baya passed in column over bridge in front slowly approached zadora about ten o'clock hill seized village of puebla commenced passage of defile while one of portuguese battalion scaled height above here french met fierce fight ensued french be reinforced on side while st regiment battalion of light infantry joined portuguese villette division be sent from french center to join fray while hill sent up reinforcement while fight on height still raged troop in defile made way through driving french back won village of subijano de alava in front of french main position meanwhile far to left graham came into action with reille division at gamara mayor french here knowing vital importance of position fought desperately village of gamara be taken retaken several time effort upon part of ally sufficed to carry either bridge at place that by main road crossed river higher up force however be pushed still farther to left there took up position on road at durana drove back franco spanish force occupied thus effectively cut main line of retreat to france for joseph army main force under wellington be later in coming into action various column being delayed by difficulty of making way through defile while waiting however for third seventh division be last to arrive peasant informed wellington that bridge of tres puentes be unbroken unguarded kempt brigade of light division be immediately ordered to cross being concealed by inequality of ground reached passed over unobserved taking place under shelter of crest within few hundred yard of french main line of battle actually in rear of advanced post french cavalry now advanced attack be made upon isolated body of british troop for french be virtually without commander joseph finding flank menaced by movement of graham hill now ordered army to fall back to crest two mile in rear at moment third seventh division advanced at run towards bridge of mendoza french artillery opened upon british gun replied heavy musketry fire broke out on side battle commenced in earnest now advantage gained by passage of kempt brigade became manifest for rifleman of division advanced took french advanced cavalry artillery in flank thus unexpectedly attacked fell back hastily brigade of third division took advantage of moment crossed bridge of mendoza other brigade forded river little higher up seventh division vandeleur brigade of light division followed hill pushed enemy farther back fourth division crossed by bridge of nanclares other troop forded river battle became general all along line seeing that hill in front of arinez be nearly denuded of troop by withdrawal of villette division earlier in day to oppose hill wellington launched picton with third division kempt brigade against french thus attacked with great strength fury dispirited by order to retreat began to fall back fifty piece of artillery cloud of skirmisher covered movement british gun answering whole basin became filled with heavy smoke under cover of french retired to height in front of gomecha upon reserve be posted picton kempt carried village of arinez with bayonet vandeleur captured village of margarita th regiment won that of hermandad advance turned flank of french troop near subijana de alava of on puebla mountain fell back in disorder for two mile until made junction with main body of army still british troop pressed forward french again fell back for six mile running fight of musketry artillery be kept up ground being very broken preventing concerted action of large body of troop at six o'clock in afternoon french stood at bay on last height before vittoria upon stood village of ali armentia behind be plain upon city stood beyond city thousand of carriage animal non combatant woman child be crowded together in extremity of terror a british shot rang menacingly over head french here defended desperately for while allied advance be checked by terrible fire of shot shell then fourth division with rush carried hill on left french again commenced retreat joseph finding great road absolutely blocked up gave order for retreat by road to salvatierra army leaving town of vittoria on left moved off in compact mass towards indicated road however like other be choked with carriage led through swamp have deep ditch on side artillery therefore have to cut trace leave gun behind infantry cavalry thrust aside encumbrance continued march reille who have defended upper bridge nobly until last moment now came up division acting a rear guard covered retreat french retired with little further loss have lost battle solely entirely from utter incapacity of general for loss have be little greater than of ally fell back in perfect order full of fighting french loss including prisoner be not more than that of ally exceeded french loss however in material be enormous carried off two gun only fell into hand of british lost park of ammunition baggage store treasure booty last of lost spain british pursued french army for day then invested two fortress of san sebastian pampeluna ten day after battle of vittoria napoleon despatched soult one of best of general to displace joseph assume supreme command of french troop traveling with great speed reached frontier upon th of july took command soon collected together division have retired beaten not routed from vittoria drew together troop from bayonne surrounding town in few day found at head of army including garrison of men besides there be army of aragon catalonia numbering men after spending few day in organizing army soult moved forward to relieve pampeluna then in heart of pyrenees be fought desperate combat at maya roncevalles buenza sauroren dona maria be known in history a battle of pyrenees in terrible nine day fighting there be ten serious combat in ally lost men french including prisoner over soult fell back baffled beaten across frontier throughout account of short sanguinary campaign by in two short month shattered power of french drove headlong from peninsula little have be said respecting doings of scudamores duty have be heavy devoid of personal achievement event wellington incarnation of activity spared one around from early dawn until late at night be on horseback carrying order bringing back report at night quarter be sometimes in village hut sometimes in straggling chateau afforded accommodation to commander in chief whole staff sam good horseman now be in highest of spirit at being able to accompany master

provision there might not be sign of feathered creature in village when staff came in in hour sam must be sure to return from foraging with couple of fowl handkerchief full of egg be of course paid for a order against pillaging be of strictest character army paid paid handsomely for everything ate be however difficult to persuade peasant payment be intended must hide everything away with vigilant care at approach of troop when by display of money be really persuaded that payment be intended must produce that have willingly enough number of officer wanting to purchase be so great amount of live stock so small in war ravaged country that few indeed must obtain even for money anything beside tough ration of freshly killed beef issued by commissariat let supply be ever so short however sam never returned empty handed fowl be quickly plucked on fire before one else have succeeded in discovering that there be bird in village sam foraging power passed into joke with staff
