hundred in buying bawley at leigh a at most other fishing place men work on share boat take share of men share owner of boat supplying net a well a boat bawley therefore brought mr robson in sum equal to earned by fisherman with deduction however for damage to net spar in good season receipt sufficed to keep boy girl comfortably in bad season have to live very closely be obliged in specially bad time to dip little into reserve of hundred pound upon other hand there be occasionally windfall when smack rendered assistance to vessel on sand helped to get up anchor discharge cargo at time of

first began work on board bawley a time went on became accustomed to life of fisherman longing for wider experience gradually faded away for be seldom indeed that leigh boy go to sea leigh men being a race devoted to home regarding with grave disapproval who strike out from regular groove did well morning mother jack said a came downstairs in clean guernsey pilot trouser have fine haul off lower

have expected news for year considerable number of leigh bawleys go down to harwich fish off port for two three month absence of jack be always great trial to when be with felt that be safe for be almost unheard of thing for bawley to meet with accident when fishing in mouth of thames off sea be heavy although even there accident be rare for boat be safe staunch fisherman handle splendidly still risk be greater than when working at home leigh men attribute freedom from accident in slight degree to fact that boat never go out on sunday be god fearing men fisherman however bad time however hard pinch be seldom indeed that bawley put out from leigh on sunday save to assistance of vessel in distress excursionist who go down in summer weather to margate ramsgate scarcely think that ship must be cast away broken up upon hidden sand beneath sparkling water know not that scarce one of sand at low water be dotted with low black timber that there be few more dangerous piece of navigation in world than passage up mouth of thames on wild night when fierce gale be blowing snow sleet driving before obscuring guiding light mark channel between sand bessy for so ben tripper have named bawley after favourite sister be lying on mud just above leigh fishy smell pervaded air for close by be boiling shed with vast heap of white cockle shell be dug by cocklers from sand at end of canvey island on maplin sand somewhere off shoebury large boat often return deeply laden with on reaching cockle be thrown out in great heap by side of creek where be covered at tide here be left to clean to get rid of sand have taken in when burrowing two three day later be carried up to boiling house thrown into great copper of boiling water open at once fish drop from shell content of copper be passed through large meshed sieve to allow fish to pas through retain shell go to add to heap outside heap must in time rival in size cinder tip of midland be not that there be use for shell make

bawleys be now carvel built plank being placed edge to edge so a to give smooth surface a in yacht large vessel now for most part carry spinnaker boomed out when running before wind balloon foresail thereby greatly adding to speed in light wind one peculiarity of bawleys be that when at mainsail instead of being stowed with spar parallel to deck be made up on gaff be then hoisted with throat seven eight foot up mast while peak rest on stern be done to give more room on deck enable men to get more easily in out of fo'castle have however curious appearance fleet of bawleys at anchor resembles nothing so much a flock of broken backed duck ben tripper mate tom hoskins finished tarring boat under water line soon after four o'clock in afternoon jack share of work consisting in

glistening red brown in sunlight beyond in ray lay long line of bawleys while score more nearer at hand lay heeled over on mud a have be left by receding tide to stranger black hulk must have looked exactly like other leigh men must tell boat afloat ashore even without looking at number painted on bulwark just a shepherd can pick out one sheep from flock be time to go back lily jack said at last

two boat be lowered anchor got into be easy matter to row boat with heavy weight in against wind tide before have got fairly away from vessel have already swung round considerable distance be heeling over good deal from force of wind tide be nearly hour before boat be far enough off to get anchor over with effect wo dare to haul on now joe said must only come home anchor ai heavy enough to work stern round expect when tug come along will get to help else will keep on driving higher higher hallo exclamation came from jack who now happened to look round towards boat have accidentally taken stand on highest point of sand bank in watching steamer have forgotten about tide under influence of north east wind have risen with great rapidity patch of dry sand be scarcely fifteen yard wide must be entirely covered in very few minute look bill boat have gone be true grapnel very light one with short length of rope have be thrown carelessly down on sand when last hauled boat up a full strength of tide have caught boat have dragged considerable distance be drifting away up ray what be to be done joe exclaimed do think must wade along to island bill jack asked bill shook head there be deep channel where must be over head ca swim stroke more can joe will swim to boat bill try get back joe shook head be in deep water now jack grapnel ai holding bit will drift a fast a can swim of course

back quiet might manage to keep up for bit anyhow boat heeling far over to breeze be dashing along at great pace towards be question of minute jack found extremely difficult to keep foot sand seemed to be scooped out from under by force of tide wind be blowing in violent gust added to difficulty of withstanding force of current wave pull jack bill said will have over ca hold on without bill will do swim off alone hold on by till go together go off by jack boat will be here in five minute now think can hold on until then anyhow be best chance be now waist deep for little by little a sand gave way under foot have be driven backwards towards deeper water there be one other thing bill do think can shift joe so a to sit on one shoulder if get on other will add to weight will try bill said be

live on board boat went only for short trip taking meal before starting on return doing cooking on board here be out for longer hour boat be always home be more independent of tide unless wind be dead against must at time run out to fishing ground ten mile away near cork lightship fishing be various sol whiting haddock be principal fish brought up in trawl there be occasionally big skate two in net have to be handled with considerable circumspection a must take off finger two with greatest ease with powerful jaw sharp teeth fish be always hung up in air for day two before eating a flesh improves by keeping eatable portion be then cut out rest be thrown overboard fish be for most part eaten by crew small sol dab flounder be hawked in town rest of take sent up to london there be excitement too in fishing apart from that connected with hauling up trawl examining content for sand off coast be dangerous wreck have at one time taken place there innumerable occasionally net must catch in one of timber have perhaps be lying there hundred year more then came up torn into fragment if obtained really firm hold there be nothing for to cut trawl rope lose altogether in fine weather however step must not be taken except a last resource after trying in vain to get net trawl up rope must be buoyed next day attempt must be made to raise net boat being assisted by three four others loss of net be serious one a took ten pound more to replace trawl beam belonging sometimes storm must blow up suddenly then net have to be got on board with speed topsail lowered mainsail reefed fleet of perhaps hundred vessel must go racing back into harwich there to anchor just above guard under shelter of shotley spit short way up orwell according to direction of wind hardest part of leigh fisherman life jack have not yet encountered for boy be seldom taken stow boating stow boating be really sprat catching one can exactly explain meaning of term be carried on in winter at edge of sand far down at mouth of river boat be out for many day together frequently in terrible sea when boat be more under than above water work of getting up net be heavy exhausting for hardship labour reward be often exceedingly slight sometimes sprat be abundant good pay be made sometimes when winter account be balanced up crew find that share will barely suffice to pay for keep on board not farthing be left for support of wife child londoner who purchase sprat at almost nominal price know little of hard struggle who have caught have to make end meet after fishing for month ben tripper said one friday evening will run up to leigh to morrow spend sunday at home think will lose much for weather look bad think there will be fishing to morrow be pretty sure there wo ben mate said think that be going to blow really hard that will get wet jacket a go up be accustomed to tripper said carelessly anyhow if come to blow too hard for can make for shelter into crouch black water oh be all right a to ben be not question of wet jacket sea that be thinking of only whether be likely to drop anchor in ray to morrow night if be sure of must not mind dusting must rather lie here quiet than have regular day heavy knocking about then have to run in to burnham after so must ben assented if wind come from anywhere to west of south be use thinking about have be chopping changing about to day there be saying way will come when fairly make up mind about think from look of sky evening that be a likely to come from north east a not in case allow will make good passage of ay be right enough tom hoskins assented say run from harwich pier to leigh have never be done yet by leigh bawley under six hour though have be pretty close several time have got spring on now with wind from north east must run six hour very close if did beat there be two three of can go faster than bessy close hauled running free doubt if there be one can touch will make start at seven ben said will take last of ebb down to walton then catch flood have at full strength by time be opposite clacton jack be delighted at thought of spending sunday at home with mother though be not for to give opinion agreed with tom hoskins that be likely to have dusting on way up sun have gone down angry threatening star must be only seen occasionally through driving mass of cloud even at snug anchorage bessy be rolling heavily jack be out soon after dawn there be haze over sea sky wind be blowing strongly be from north west now jack thought that be likely to draw round to quarter uncle have predicted there must be heavy sea on now way from swin middle to nore with wind meeting lee tide said to of course when ebb be done will smooth down bit will be all right if weather doe not come on too thick fog be bad enough gale be bad enough when get two together must rather be at home in bed by long way than on board bessy well jack what do make out of weather ben tripper asked a came out from fo'castle look rather wild uncle think wind be working round to north of east just a thought must last night yes think be ben said surveying sky well get fire alight at once jack get breakfast ready will have meal before start will have enough to do when be once under way will run down to naze anyhow then will see what be like outside if like look can pop back anyhow will have lost nothing for there be shooting net to day be quite certain

to course have before be following wind be almost on beam even under reduced canvas bessy be lying far over water covering three plank of deck on starboard side must see buoy presently must hear deep tolling a hammer struck bell with motion of buoy ah here be heavy rain squall coming down be glad be round bell buoy before came up jack may a well put tea kettle on cup of tea will be comfort three be wrapped up in oil skin in spite of have general sensation of dampness for have be raining more le ever since started jack be below when heard far louder roar of wind than before heard uncle shout brail up main a far a can tom jib be about want now jack looked out from fo'castle wind be blowing tremendously sweeping head off wave driving into sheet of spray then great drop of rain struck deck almost with force of bullet minute later came down almost in bucketful do want uncle shouted voice did not reach ben ear guessed what have said waved hand to to remain in fo'castle jack took off sou wester shook water from oil skin then opening locker where coke be kept replenished fire settled down so dark when squall struck boat that must scarce see across little cabin regardless of howling of wind motion of vessel sat on floor putting in stick after stick to hasten up fire a soon a kettle boiled put in handful of tea sugar took kettle off fire then got couple of large mug half filled with tea sat balancing until fluid be sufficiently cool to be drunk then tying on sou ' wester again made way out gave mug to of others go down below again jack uncle shouted at top of voice although jack be within two three foot of scarcely heard there be nothing to be done at present here be use looking out for swin middle at present jack took look round before went below away at distance on hand be white mass of foam where sea be breaking on sand went up to bow looked ahead through darkness then went back to uncle caught sight of light right over bowsprit ah have lit up then tripper said thought must for be almost a dark a night have best get side light ready flareup suppose will want for if see steamer coming down will give clear berth wo be able to look far ahead in face of wind rain jack went forward again lay down on locker thought little of storm be severe one doubt with wind nearly due aft weather tide be nothing to bessy whose great beam in comparison to length enabled to run easily before wind when long narrow craft must have be burying presently thought heard uncle shout getting up looked aft tom hoskins be now at helm tripper be standing beside pointing at something broad away on beam jack at once made way aft what be uncle saw flash of gun ah there be again there be ship ashore on middle sunk jack gazed in direction in uncle be pointing in minute there be flash be over with ben tripper said solemnly strongest ship that ever be built must not hold together long on sand with sea on a there will be there now can not do something tripper be silent for minute what do think tom might get there through swashway there be plenty of water for must lay course there be risky business know may not be able to get near when get there that can not tell till see how be fixed still if must get there before go to piece might perhaps save of mind ben if other said have wife child if like to take risk be ready ben tripper looked at jack must not mind if be for boy said mind uncle jack burst out must not have hang back because of not for anything in world do try uncle must be awful to think of afterwards when hear of being lost with hand that might have saved of perhaps if have tried ben still hesitated when bright flash be seen be appeal for aid must not resist put down helm tom said now jack help to rouse in sheet will do now then for pull on jib sheet now will put last reef in foresail hoist slack brail haul down main tack bit must keep good way on crossing tide now that be nearly close hauled instead of running before wind jack recognized much more strongly than before how heavy be sea how great force of wind lively a boat be great mass of water poured over bow swept aft a wave struck lee bulwark be completely buried give helm tom tripper said get hatchway up cover well lash tarpaulin over be bad enough here will be worse when get into broken water near wreck most of bawleys be provided with hatch for closing long narrow place known a 'well be only under quite exceptional circumstance that be ever used jack man got up managed to fit in place getting tarpaulin over be beyond power will throw up into wind ben said haul on weather fore sheet a do belay with foot of sail just to windward of mast now rouse in main sheet be right quitting tiller a boat lay to to wind ben lent aid to other two in three four minute tarpaulin be securely lashed over hatch boat completely battened down now jack have best lash to something will be swept overboard will have lot worse than presently now tom before get well away again get last reef in mainsail then can haul tack down taut again sail will stand much better so will want to keep to windward if be to go through swashway when be ready fore weather sheet be let go lee sheet hauled main sheet be slacked off little bessy proceeded on way be terrible half hour fortunately dense heavy cloud have broken little be lighter than have be only rendered danger more distinct once in swashway be name given to narrow channel between sand wave be le high on hand be breaking wildly for there be still four five foot of water over sand sea be nearly abeam now several time jack almost held breath a wave lifted bessy bodily to leeward threatened to cast into breaking water few fathom away skipper knew boat well humoured through wave taking advantage of squall to eat up little to windward always keeping sail full plenty of way on at last be through swashway though sea be again heavier wave frequently swept over deck jack gave sigh of relief must make out hull of vessel now looming up black over white surf surrounded have ceased firing from powder being wetted gun disabled way have better get at tom ben tripper asked be pretty near on top of sand only way have chance of helping be by laying to anchoring on edge of sand to leeward of may be able to drift line down to see other way anchor must hold to windward of suppose be best way tom must make best allowance can for wind set of tide otherwise will never drift line down to wo hold together long stern be gone a far a mizzen so must be quick about wreck be evidently sailing vessel mast be gone bulwark carried away lay far heeled over group of people must be seen huddled up in bow a neared tom hoskins jack have for last ten minute be busy getting spare anchor up on deck fastening to wrap of trawl net be by far strongest rope have on board what water be there on sand ben six seven foot on edge le further on draw over five foot so will keep on till touch moment do so let two anchor go wind tide will take off again quick enough pay out ten twelve fathom of chain directly hold up drop lead line overboard to see if drag if doe give more rope chain anchor be got overboard in readiness to let go at moment notice instant bessy took ground foresail be lowered mainsail partly brailed up so that have only way on sufficient to stem tide a entered broken water jack be obliged to take step back hold on to mast motion have before be violent to certain extent regular now be tossed in direction so sharply violently that expected moment that mast must go tom looked round at latter pointed to sail waved hand tom understood going to mast loosened brail little to give more sail for wave completely knocked way out of when forged ahead again tom returned to post jack held breath time boat pitched kept on without touching until within eighty yard of wreck then a pitched forward down wave there be shock nearly threw jack off foot prepared for though be in moment steadied crept forward cut lashing of hawser just a tom severed that of chain latter rattled out for moment there be shock le violent than first then renewed rattle of chain showed that be drifting astern ben now left tiller sprang forward jib be run in by traveller got down foresail have be cast off have run down forestay moment struck three now set to work to lower mainsail be dragging tom said examining lead line not fast give five six fathom of chain ben said attending to veering out of hawser done again watched lead line hung straight down by side of vessel have got ben said now then for ship for first time since entered broken water have leisure to look about on board ship have lost time have already launched light spar with line tied to into water will miss ben said after watching spar for minute see allowed for wind tide wind doe not affect spar tide will sweep down thirty forty yard on port bow turned out so on board payed out line until spar floated abreast of smack at distance of thirty yard away what be to be done ben asked if be to try to get up sail again must drift away so far to leeward must never be able to beat back look here jack said if signal to to veer out more rope must soon do must not swim across tide now if be twenty fathom further astern must manage must never swim in sea jack well must try uncle of course must fasten line round if can not get there will haul in again there can not be danger about so saying jack at once proceeded to throw off oil skin sea boot while ben went to bow of boat waved to on wreck to slack out more line soon understood spar be presently floating twenty yard further astern jack have by time stripped strong line be now fastened round body under arm going up to bow of boat so a to give a long distance a possible to drift prepared for swim chapter v rescue jack be good swimmer have never swum in sea like if raise arm uncle pull in at once if see can not reach spar sha' exhaust by going on will come back take fresh start let have plenty of rope right jack wo check jack took header swimming hard under water came up distance from boat will do tom shouted in ben ear be nigh half way between rope already be however more difficult task than looked have water be smooth must have be easy for jack to swim across tide to spar before be swept below found at once that be impossible to swim fast so buffeted tossed be by sea while be almost smothered by spray carried by wind to top of wave trod water for moment with back to wind took deep breath then dived again when came up be delighted to see that be a near a possible in line of spar be towing few yard from ceased swimming moment later tide swept down upon have before starting fastened piece of lashing three foot long to loop round chest moment reached spar lashed firmly round rope passing one arm round spar lifted other above head in moment felt strain of rope round chest soon tightened above water jack felt that strain of pulling not only spar through water might be too much for rather than run risk again waved hand a soon a line slacked fastened to rope from wreck loosened hitch round spar allowed latter to float away be half drowned by time reached side of bawley for have be dragged in teeth of wind tide wave have swept clean over head illustration rescue of passenger from wreck at first on board pulled slowly in order to enable to swim over top of wave force of spray in face be so great that must not breathe waved to that must draw in at once a soon a understood pulled in rope with will more under than above water be brought to side of smack lifted on board wind bringing down sound of cheer from on board wreck a be got out of water ben undid line round body carried downstairs wrapped couple of blanket round laid down on locker then ran upstairs to assist tom who have carried line forward be already hauling in be right tom have got good strong hawser on see there be light line coming with to carry sling a soon a end of hawser came on board be fastened to mast line by have be hauled in be unfastened tied to looped round hawser payed out a on deck hauled on minute later two sailor got over bulwark woman be lifted over to placed in strong sling beneath hawser lashing be put round then waved hand fisherman hauled on line in two minute woman be on deck of smack lashing be unfastened knotted on to sling ready for next passenger then at ben signal that be ready on board wreck hauled sling back again jack remained between blanket for minute two have not lost consciousness a soon a breath came jumped up gave rub with blanket slipped into dry clothes be on deck just a woman arrived be insensible directly sling have started on return journey ben carried on into fo'castle jack set to work make lot of cocoa there be spirit on board cocoa be better after put other kettle on chuck plenty of wood upon fire a soon a one be boiling now be empty fill up again must say there be twenty thirty of pint apiece will not be too much take drink lad a soon a have made want a much a do fast shipwrecked people came along line there be not moment to lose for wreck be breaking up fast sea brought floating timber past bawley be good job now tom that anchored where did instead of in direct line of tide for one of timber must stave hole in bow a if be bandbox aye that must ben thought have made rather mess of at first be well that a say ai in line of drift nineteen person be brought on board captain being last to come along line first four be woman rather first two be woman third girl of ten year old fourth woman then came middle aged man evidently passenger then came ten sailor steward two mate captain be that ben asked a captain stepped from sling be last captain said thank god be saved who be left on board when came in sight owe life to men have little hope that one of must live to see night when made out coming towards there be time to talk ship can not hold together many minute longer when break up in earnest of timber will be sure to come way have got buoy with length of rope on chain ready to slip ben said spar lashed to hawser now tom let chain out will jump below knock out shackle now captain if one two of men will lend hand to get up canvas will be out of sooner please get except woman out of cabin put aft want head well up for running before sea now lad tumble out lend hand captain said see have got cocoa here well who have have mug come out at once let others get aft a soon a have have share lady be right hope quite right captain one of men answered begin to feel warm already be natural enough for cabin be like oven after deck of petrel now skipper do give order captain said a ben took tiller run up foresail haul in starboard sheet will bring head round now let go cable hawser there be sharp rattle of chain

main sheet well boom sail out with oar trice main tack up a far a will go bessy be now running almost before wind moment great wave loomed up high behind stern looked a if must dash down upon deck slipped easily away cloud have broken up much now wind have in way abated gleam two of sunlight made way through rift of cloud threw light green patch upon gray angry sea be splendid sea boat of captain said must hardly have believed small craft must have made such good weather in such sea there be few boat will beat bawley ben said well handled will live through pretty near anything can quite believe that of be who sprang overboard to get line be not either of ben said tom can swim stroke be nephew jack that lad who have just come out of fo'castle be gallant action captain said must have thought well nigh impossible to swim in such broken water be astonished when saw leap overboard saw that spar have drifted with tide to windward of there be other way of getting at be in hope of seeing throw lead line over line might have hauled in way so might ben agreed if have thought of though doubt whether must have cast so far still ought to have tried be stupid trick to be sure allow must have thought of other time have have dusting in getting up to that brain must have gone wool gathering one can not think of everything captain said have hand full a be be there anything else can do at present if not will just go below for minute see how wife passenger be getting on have cup of cocoa if there be left be now in knob channel sea although still heavy be more regular a passed mouse light ship there be several large steamer at anchor there be now straight run down to nore held on ben tripper have already asked captain where must like to be landed can put into sheerness southend leigh said tide be high now can land at of without difficulty must get more quickly up to town from southend leigh must recommend side because tide will be running out from medway pretty strong before get there when be case there be nasty sea at mouth think can not do better than leigh captain said of course be anxious to get on shore a soon a can to get woman into dry clothes will not make more than twenty minute difference whether land at leigh southend be much handier for landing at leigh distance to inn where can get between blanket while thing be being dried then leigh let be few minute will make difference one way other if have not caught cold already will not do so in warm cabin wind be blowing far too strongly to admit of conversation except in shouted sentence fortunately there be good supply of tobacco on board rescued sailor who have almost pipe in pocket have after smack be once clear of broken water enjoyed consolation of smoke accustomed to look down on water from high deck of large ship have at first felt doubt a to ability of low bawley to struggle safely through towering wave a soon a saw how well behaved how little water took over side felt that danger be over became disposed to look at thing more cheerfully steward have a soon a came on board relieved jack of duty at galley have kept kettle going now served out second supply of cocoa round hung up a many of lady thing a must dispense with round fire to dry passenger have remained below with lady be suffering from broken leg having be knocked down swept along by sea soon after vessel struck six of sailor two of mate have be washed overboard crushed to death when mast went over side a passed nore perfect fleet of steamer sailing vessel be at anchor there tide have turned strongly now there be nasty heavy choppy sea until bessy passed end of southend pier when entered comparatively smooth water in le than hour sail be lowered anchored fifty yard from coast guard station look out there have already observed number of people on deck have guessed at once that have taken crew off wreck of kind a soon a anchor be dropped boat came alongside captain have a neared shore asked tripper about inn at once sent crew ashore in charge of mate with order to go to bell to see that have everything required saying that must a soon a lady be on shore go to one of shop order supply of clothes to be sent up for lady be next taken ashore then injured man carried up placed in boat stretcher being sent off for to be laid on messenger have be already sent up to doctor on top of hill to come down to ship inn where party now went lady have become so thoroughly warmed by heat in little cabin that declined to go to bed having be supplied with dry garment by landlady be soon comfortable surgeon on arrival pronounced fracture of passenger leg be few inch above ankle to be simple one not likely to be attended with serious consequence after setting bandaged in splint said that although must recommend few day perfect quiet there be actual reason why patient must not be taken up to london if particularly wished ben tripper have gone with captain pile of flannel shirt stocking guernsey trouser shoe have at once be sent up to bell furious a be gale be possible to speak so a to be heard in street of leigh ben now learned for first time particular about wreck petrel be seven hundred ton ship captain said on way home from australia belongs to james godstone son there be james godstone now son be passenger saved be owner of dozen vessel about same size a petrel wife daughter be two of lady saved went out with to australia girl be not strong have be recommended sea voyage have be married when be at home last time be taking wife out with so mr godstone arranged that wife daughter must go with carried other passenger other woman saved be stewardess mr godstone did not go out with went across by suez joined there for homeward voyage made fine run home took pilot on board off deal gale be blowing up then a looked a if be coming from north east did not care about riding out in down going back so a to be under shelter of south foreland did not come on really heavy till be nearly off margate then got with vengeance still a wind be free kept on then a know came on almost pitch dark think pilot lost head anyhow a be one of who be drowned need not say whether be to blame not thought be getting too close to broken water told so said be all right did make allowance enough think for leeway be making minute later struck can guess rest back broke in few minute mizzen went over side carrying with pilot first mate six sailor soon after began to break up at stern cut away other two mast to relieve sea made clear breach over got lady mr godstone who have be on deck when struck got leg broken by first sea pooped forward a soon a must managed to fire one of gun three time have hope of rescue coming from shore there be chance of ship coming up helping though how be to do must not see however nothing came near until saw sail expect that steamer coming up from south brought up under foreland while from north must of course take swin anyhow must have be over with have not come to rescue even when saw making over towards have not much hope for did not see how must get close enough to to aid be quite sure that open boat must have lived in broken water chapter vi altered prospect a soon a shipwrecked crew be on shore jack robson landed made way homeward at railway crossing met mother hurrying down for news that bessy have arrived with number of shipwrecked people have spread rapidly through place well jack so hear bessy have be helping wreck have idea that must be home to day what in world induced uncle to make run in such weather a be nothing like so bad when started mother a have wind tide with there be nothing to fear for bessy be accustomed to wet jacket must have got nothing worse if have not be for hearing gun making for wreck then certainly have tremendous sea heaviest have ever be out in however be under storm sail did very well be nasty work when anchored in broken water near wreck jumped about so thought mast must have gone however everything held managed to save nineteen people from wreck be pleasant thought mother must go through again twenty time to do by time have reached door of house there run upstairs change jack will get tea ready by time come down have have hot cocoa mother be a right a possible still will not object to cup of tea something to eat with have breakfast before started at eight be seven now thought when hoisted sail must be down here under six hour of course going off to wreck made difference anyhow must not have driven fast in such sea by time jack have have tea comfortable glow have come over now that be over felt bruised stiff from buffeting have gone through after hour chat with mother sister in told more fully event of wreck turned into bed slept soundly till morning captain murchison for be name came round hour after jack have gone up to bed to ask to go round to inn a lady wished to see thank for share in rescuing on hearing that have gone up to bed asked mother to request to come round in morning at ten o'clock have reason to be proud of son mr robson said leaping over in such sea a to get hold of line from ship be most gallant action told line be tied round sir so that there be danger in at there be always danger in such business a mr robson force of wave in willow water be tremendous will beat man to death if drown then there be difficulty of getting on board again when vessel be rolling pitching so tremendously danger of being struck by piece of drift wood from wreck can assure that be very grand action son may have told about next morning gale be still blowing fiercely although with le strength than on previous day jack have heard from mother of appointment to go to ship with much discontent have at first positively refused to go hate going up to see strange people mother anyhow be sure want to be thanked be glad enough to have have share in saving life of course be uncle ben tom handling boat did have nothing to do with except little swim with rope tied safely round why be nothing to affair have with bill joe corbett must go jack lady naturally wish to thank for what did for whether like not must go must be very rude uncivil not to do so must be sure to send round here if did not come what must say except be so unmannerly that must not go jack twisted on chair uncomfortably see why must thank uncle ben for lot have done with grumbled be boat be skipper did besides expect bessy will have to be overhauled before go out again came down with tremendous crash on forefoot water be just coming up through board in fo'castle when came in of course may have come in from above expect sprang leak somewhere forward thought be very low in water when came in expect that must have be half full aft for be very much down by stern have pump going time be always clear water did not think of at time have have lot of water over be likely might have got in through hatch feel sure now that be leak well suppose if must go must mother hate for however just before jack be about to start there be knock at door mr robson opening saw two lady girl immediately on arrival evening before mr godstone have telegraphed home for servant to come down in morning by first train with clothes for herself daughter have arrived with hour before mr godstone have therefore be enabled to resume usual attire to lend outfit to mr murchison jack did not in least recognize in three lady soaked draggled woman of whose face have caught slight glimpse on previous day have come round mr robson mr godstone began to thank son for share in saving life yesterday thought that must be more pleasant to than coming round to at inn thank madam mr robson replied be kind of to think of have have good deal of trouble in persuading jack to go round be just

acquired manner of husband friend be still more surprised at pretty furniture of room be tastefully decorated wall hung with picture of marine subject for bessy have brought down bodily belonging from dulwich mr godstone at once walked up to jack with outstretched hand hope be none worse for exertion of yesterday said daughter have come round to thank for very great service rendered mr murchison mildred godstone also shook hand with jack former added thanks to mr godstone jack coloured up hotly said be uncle have to thank ma'be be bawley tom sailed have nothing to do with one way other except when swam out for line mr godstone said smiling have one tied round be right jack protested husband doe not think be nothing a seem to consider mr murchison said a have be sailor life ought to know say that be very gallant action in such sea a see be bound to believe lady have now taken seat mr godstone felt little at loss have jack home jack mother be what have expected to find matter must have be simple enough felt at once that talk of reward for service jack have rendered must be at present impossible what pretty room have got mr robson what charming picture be husband painting mr robson said quietly be artist oh know name mr godstone said have four of mr robson picture in drawing room be very fond of marine subject served a introduction for hour conversation proceeded briskly then mr godstone rose husband leg be very painful morning said fear that will have to keep bed for next two three day when be well enough to lie down on sofa will come down fetch son for mr godstone be of course anxious to see be afraid that if come round will not get jack to inn well be not so very bad be jack mr robson asked after visitor have left no mother be see be ever so much better coming here than must have be if have gone to inn because there be for to talk to so that really there be not much said to if have be at inn there must have be nothing to talk about at except about wreck well now be over will go down see how bawley be have best change thing first uncle be going to get up a high a must at top of tide so a to be able to look at keel jack found that uncle tom have turned out at three o'clock in morning have got bessy a high up a possible on sloping shore just beyond house be standing beside now while benting local boat builder be examining bottom well jack have taken out in sleep morning uncle said have uncle never woke until eight o'clock so have just twelve hour sleep nothing like good sleep jack when have have hard day work yesterday be enough to take out of anyone be damaged at jack asked yes forefoot be sprung just where join keel came down just on joint will be rather nasty job to get right wo yes jack benting say must have new stem altogether doe not think keel be damaged stem be cracked right through will cost lot wo jack said yes be nasty job jack because of course will want lot of fresh plank in in fact will want pretty well rebuilding forward of mast will cost about twenty pound to make good job of benting said a joined must like to take job for le not on contract if did day work might come to little le little more can not say jack looked anxiously up into uncle face for knew that twenty pound be serious matter wo be at expense jack ben replied to look captain murchison came down at seven o'clock morning have look at with told yesterday that be afraid have damaged on sand a have made lot of water on way up said be to have examined at once get estimate for repairing thoroughly that must undertake must be paid asked what age be of course told be only four year old have only finished paying off money borrowed when have built last year said that a be only four year old be worth spending money on if have be old boat must not have be worth while throwing money away on benting say can make a good a new again bit carpenter said will be just a strong a be on day be turned out how long will be about must get done in three week will go over to southend by twelve o'clock train order timber can arrange evening whether will have done by contract day work captain murchison that evening when returned from town where have gone up to report to lloyd loss of ship have talk with benting being assured by that bessy must after execution of repair be in respect a stout craft a before arranged with to do for sum named to set to work immediately three day later mr godstone be able to be brought out on to sofa in sitting room captain mr murchison have gone home two day before former came down again to leigh on morning mr godstone got up after talk together captain murchison went out fetched ben tripper in mr godstone presented with cheque for hundred pound for fifty for tom hoskins owe life said will never forget service have rendered captain murchison tell that boat will be a good a before after be repaired if must not be so sell at once for what can get for order new one will pay difference in case consider owe boat whether be five year hence ten fifteen if be alive want boat give authority to order one of best can be built to tell to send bill in to have not given anything for nephew for have be talking to wife maybe can serve better in other way mr godstone have indeed be in for chat day with jack mother have told husband that felt sure mr robson jack must like offer of money lad be very intelligent said mother be of quite different class to fisher people here father be gentleman have manner of lady must like for to do boy permanent good william well will see about dear husband have said a soon a be well enough to talk to will find out what own wish in matter be jack be therefore sent for after uncle have left inn well lad mr godstone said a entered be glad to see at last to thank for what did for other day wife tell that like being thanked a deed be better than word wo say much more about so hear have only be living here about two year be sir lived at dulwich before so hear father be artist have taste way jack shook head sir never thought of being artist always wanted to go to sea to go to sea eh mr godstone repeated well then have got wish oh call going to sea jack said contemptuously mean wanted to be sailor not fisherman why did go then lad well sir in first place mother did not know anyone who have to do with ship then friend be here knew place way thought that by buying bawley a have done in time must come to sail earn living a uncle doe then think must ever have agreed to going to sea right away from know about well lad see case be changed now have to do with ship captain murchison here command one at least doe at present moment will do so a soon a can buy to supply place of petrel a saw one yesterday that think highly of will probably buy a soon a have be surveyed so see that difficulty be at end a to mother doubt must have objected to going a ship boy perhaps must if be going a apprentice call midshipman on board ship like name better than apprentice though thing be about same captain murchison will be sure be glad to have with will do best to make good sailor of may be sure that will push on if deserve a fast a possible may be that in ten year will be in command of one of ship well what do say to oh thank sir jack exclaimed must like that better than anything in world if mother will let think that mother will stand in way of good mr godstone said must see that prospect be far better one than can have here for after profit of bawley be not large life be infinitely harder one than of sailor have better not say anything to mother about until wife have have chat with chapter vii on board wild wave mr godstone found difficulty whatever in persuading jack mother to allow to take advantage of husband offer mr robson have at husband death decided at once that with small sum of money at disposal only method must see of making end meet be to go down to leigh invest in bawley have never told jack that have even thought of allowing to carry out wish to go to sea have thought over have only decided on making fisherman of after much deliberation desire to keep with have of course weighed with be secondary consideration have so decided because be evident that have gone to sea must have be a ship boy in such rough life must have have time to continue study must speedily have forgotten most that have learned might have remained many year before mast before must pas a third mate thought therefore that must do better by remaining at leigh becoming in time master of bawley in two year have passed have come to have doubt a to whether have decided wisely profit of fishing be exceedingly small prospect be poor knew well that husband have hoped that son must follow line must maintain in own rank of life fretted at thought jack must settle down for life a leigh fisherman that lily must probably in time become fisherman wife when therefore mr godstone told that husband be ready to place jack on board one of ship a midshipman that must take care have chance of making way up mr robson thankfully accepted offer boy have always wished for life at sea said be thankful indeed that must have chance of getting on be most grateful to mr godstone for offer most gladly accept be least husband can do mr robson considering share son took in saving life must not consider that discharge debt owe for mildred be matter altogether now in first place be sure must wish sometimes that little girl must have education of different kind to can obtain here now must like to send to good school where must be well educated need not look farther forward than at present be only ten year old now in seven eight brother may be second mate with prospect of becoming captain in three four must like sister to be educated a lady be very kind mr godstone mr robson said with tear in eye in first place think must bring to part with in second like to take advantage of kindness second reason be absurd mr godstone said decidedly suppose instead of saving life son have helped to get out anchor have got ship off must have have share of salvage might have come to many hundred of pound be nonsense because saved life instead of good there must be reward for service a to first reason can quite enter into know must not have liked to be parted from mildred therefore propose to send away from to do in way to send girl to really good school will not cost le than hundred year that sum will be very glad to pay until be of age to leave school now understand that principal reason in coming to leigh be that son must in time be able to sail boat that reason doe not exist longer might therefore be a well anywhere else a here brother can look after interest in boat will get same share of profit a if be living here think for son sake a well a daughter must be pleasanter better that be away from here now be going to pay hundred year for girl to be educated make difference to how hundred be spent providing get education seems to therefore that must be better if be to move again say to dulwich where doubt have still friend having lived there for so long then must send a day boarder in good school for thirty forty pound year must still keep with have nice home for jack whenever come back from sea well think over seems to to mr godstone to be by far best plan for party will be much most pleasant to a must then hope to see often to see for how child be getting on give answer to now will be week before husband can be moved up to town so there will be plenty of time for to look at in light before decide know

not intended to go so far have only wished to add to excitement ill feeling that prevailed by tumult attended with loss of life upon side be well satisfied when saw how eagerly native rushed to arm a soon a conflict fairly began have sent men among rioter urging not to proceed further until army be at hand to support knew that plunder have obtained from small shop must only excite desire to appropriate content of rich store in european quarter be therefore well contented with what have be done have happened to be passing when little party rushed from burning house into crowd a did so caught sight of naval uniform of boy imagined that belonged to one of ship of war saw at once that life might be valuable to if party triumphed must hand over take credit for capture if great

alexandria government of khedive minister be really nothing more than nominee of arabi army demand of english admiral for satisfaction for outrage compensation to sufferer punishment of guilty be met with evasive answer so threatening insolent be bearing of egyptian troop that greater part of european population again left house took refuge on board ship in harbour more more peremptory became

sailed out of crowded with fugitive from town english fleet consisted of invincible monarch penelope sultan alexandria superb inflexible temeraire with gun boat signet condor bittern beacon decoy nearly month have passed since lad have be taken prisoner be in absolute ignorance a to what be going on in town except that have be told by one of guard who spoke few word of english that arabi troop be master of alexandria that european in egypt must be destroyed may be master of alexandria at present jim tucker said to comrade a talked matter over wo be master long be possible enough that may cut throat of european in egypt will have to pay dearly for if do believe will keep alexandria long just look at men of war in harbour why there be white ensign flying over dozen of suppose be wasting time palavering at present when time for action come see will astonish egyptian fellow said morning that there be twenty thousand troop in town jack said if there be hundred thousand must make odds jack must make odds about blowing place up jim must make lot of odds if came to landing suppose must land more than couple of thousand sailor from fleet if did a much though have doubt must lick about five time own number in field must be awkward business if have to fight way through narrow street of town well suppose there will be ship along with troop soon jim said must take fortnight three week to get ready fortnight to get out here perhaps waited week so to see whether egyptian be going to cave in before began to get ready at rate there ought to be troop here in fortnight next morning early four of guard came down motioned to follow be evidently in high glee among be one who spoke english come along english boy said big fight going to begin see fort sink ship in time well will see about tucker muttered a followed guard perhaps be crowing too early fine fellow at rate arthur hill said may thank for giving view of guard led to spot where six seven other men like armed with musket be standing sitting on bank commanded view of port sea beyond boy threw on ground looked at panorama stretched away before must see two great port known a old new port with peninsula jutting out between on stood khedive palace named ra el tin other important building beyond stretched long spit of land parallel with shore sheltering two port spit be studded with fort formed principal defence of alexandria although there be several fort among fort mex marabout on mainland near mouth of harbour most of fort have be erected under superintendence of french engineer be considered capable of defending town against naval force must be brought against be armed with heavy artillery of best modern construction port be entirely clear of shipping ranged along facing fort lay eight british ironclad four of faced fort at ra el tin mouth of harbour three lay off mex battery one off fort commanding what be known a boghaz channel while little group of gun boat lay out beyond line of battleship further away to east must be seen great number of sailing boat steamer just at seven o'clock great puff of white smoke broke out from black side of invincible be carrying admiral flag even before sound reached ear of little party on hill similar burst of smoke spurted out from other vessel then came deep roar of heavy artillery mingled with rushing sound of huge missile through air almost immediately answering fire broke out from battery fringing sea in minute two hull lower mast of men of war be entirely hidden in cloud of white smoke very ground seemed to shake with thunder of heavy gun mingled with came sharper sound of of smaller artillery in fort long rattle of machine gun in top of men of war so terrible be din that egyptian ceased chatter sat in awed silence shell from egyptian gun must be seen bursting over vessel while jet of water spurting out far to seaward in direction marked course of round shot be downright awful be arthur hill said in hushed voice have often thought must like to see sea fight never thought must be a terrible a more did arthur jack agreed feel just a have done when have be out in bawley big thunder storm have burst overhead if feel like here what must be on board ship believe be so bad there jim tucker said be hard at work there at big gun have got much time to think about wish must see what harm shot be doing have got tremendous gun in of fort pretty well a big a be on board for hour there be change whatever in state of thing then little gun boat be seen to be in motion steaming away to west engaged marabout fort have hitherto taken part in fray without return on part of assailant believe fire of fort be slackening jack said look at fort at entrance to harbour outline be ragged uneven wish wind must freshen up bit to let see little more of what be going on hour be evident to that fire of fort be nothing like a heavy a have be at first while gun of fleet continued to thunder a steadily a when first commenced at twelve o'clock several of fort have ceased to fire altogether at one gun boat having silenced marabout fort joined three men of war in bombardment of mex battery temeraire having silenced fort at entrance of boghaz channel joined in attack on ra el tin pharos fort at three o'clock there be tremendous explosion in pharos fort now only occasional gun answered fire of assailant soon ceased at four signal flag be seen to run up to masthead of invincible instantly fire from british ship ceased dead silence succeeded din of battle have continued almost unbroken for nine hour chapter xii free for two three hour before cessation of bombardment flame have be bursting out from several building in neighbourhood of palace of ra el tin being in line of fire have doubtless be struck by shell from ship passing over fort in front when fire ceased egyptian rose motioned boy to return to prison well see friend jack said to man who spoke english have not sunk english vessel in few minute a talked about not even one of little gun boat a far a can see from here have not even damaged man made reply to comrade escape of british ship be mystery that be made of iron understood have idea of enormous thickness of side must not even imagine that ship must be built sufficiently strong to keep out missile discharged by immense cannon in fort that not even mast must have be knocked away seemed to almost miraculous in point of fact ship have be struck once twice with shell from massive cannon egyptian gunner be unaccustomed to use of huge piece have consequently aimed too high shell have passed either between mast far overhead upon other hand smaller gun have be worked with accuracy missile have dropped harmless from iron plate of ship fire of men of war have in first place be directed mainly against great cannon machine gun in top have created terrible havoc among men who be carrying on laborious to difficult operation of loading while huge shell from great gun have carried wholesale destruction among thus powerful gun upon egyptian have relied to beat off attack from sea have be fired seldom one by one have be dismounted rendered unserviceable by fire from ship gallantry with egyptian gunner stuck to work be object of surprise admiration to british sailor seemed scarce possible that men must work under so tremendous fire a to be exposed fort be literally torn to piece at end of day be little better than heap of ruin scattered thickly with corps of egyptian artilleryman well what do suppose will be up to next jim arthur hill asked when door have again closed upon suppose will begin again to morrow if fellow have not have enough of see hardly fired gun for last three hour a far a must see fort be pretty well knocked to piece one at mouth of harbour blew up there be several other explosion held out lot better than thought must do must say can not believe will be fool enough to go on to morrow chatted for time a to chance of surrender of resistance to last a to what be likely to befall then wearied with excitement of day voice became more more drowsy dosed off upon heap of straw jack be first to wake sat up looked round puzzled for time say wake up fellow exclaimed suddenly there be tremendous fire somewhere others sat up at once have be asleep for hour night have fallen there be red glow of light in cell here arthur jump up on shoulder jim said standing under opening in wall arthur climbed up uttered exclamation a eye became level with opening can not see town think must be on fire be almost a light a day outside whole air be full of spark red cloud of smoke be tremendous jump down let have look jim said impatiently jack have by turn view of scene quarter of hour later door opened suddenly four of guard ran in come quick one of said seizing boy by wrist hurried up stair house be in confusion men be packing up bundle bey giving direction in angry voice a soon a eye fell on boy gave order in egyptian take off clothes quick guard translated order be evidently time for hesitation boy took off waistcoat jacket trouser then guard picked up from bundle lying beside three woman dress wound round bringing end a usual over head falling down to eye then put on thick blue veil extending across face just under eye falling down to waist disguise be thus completed three boy be transformed into egyptian peasant woman of whom only eye be visible five minute be ready bey with ten twelve men boy started out from house most of men carried musket have large bundle upon shoulder a issued from house boy obtained full sight of city uttered simultaneous exclamation a did so city appeared to be in flame sea of fire extended from port over european quarter including great square while in many other part separate conflagration be raging there be however time to pause to examine scene party hurried along until came down upon road leading across narrow strip of land running between two inland lake be crowded with fugitive mixed up pell mell together be egyptian soldier in great number population of town men woman child for four hour walked along then throng along road thinned egyptian drum be sounding soldier turned off lay down in field ready to form into regiment again in morning rest of fugitive feeling that be now beyond danger of pursuit soon followed example party to boy belonged kept on for short distance further then turned off followed by road for quarter of mile then stopped at farm building on knocking at door peasant came out at word from bey at once drew aside for party to enter bey took possession of cottage men leaving bundle inside threw down on ground without be soon fast asleep idea that captive might escape did not even occur to boy have thrown down little apart from rest be nice go jim said chap be taking off a hostage may be dragged about like for time for until army be got together conquers whole country see how be going to be released see what there be to prevent going straight back again jack said have got splendid disguise might go anywhere be not bad idea jack how be to do one be coming other way yes think can go back by road jack agreed might get round other side of lake must think how be to do jack know anything about country know much about jim remember day before landed when be looking at book mr hoare lent so a to get up something about alexandria before landed there be map of town remember that lake behind called mareotis such name extended eight ten mile to west of town be only separated from sea by high beach on mex fort stand see why must not work round there get down on to beach make way on to town fellow be sure to land to morrow morning take possession of have passed across isthmus between two lake so one want to get round must lie somewhere to north west anyhow fire will be guide to if keep rather to left of must strike lake have only got to follow to keep right be with jim said what do say arthur be game arthur replied let be off at once what time do think be have idea know how long slept be quite dark except for fire so must certainly have be past eight o'clock set out hour later must say that must be between twelve one now if not later will begin to get light again soon after four so have time to lose well let crawl away a quietly a can jack said think chap be asleep can not be too careful until get bit away from boy found very difficult to crawl in female garment kept on a noiselessly a possible until distance from cottage then stood up followed lane until came to road crossed line of railway beyond swam fresh water canal then guided by glare of light over alexandria made way across field after hour walking found on shore of lake be low swampy have to keep distance from edge reflection of light on smooth surface enabled to follow direction a well a if have be walking close to kept on until morning broke by time glare of light above alexandria lay due north of have better lie up here jim said there be sure to be village near lake first person who came across questioned must find out will not be sorry to stop at jack said for loose yellow slipper thing be horrid for walking in have tried going barefoot for bit there be prickly thing in grass soon have to give up there be difficulty in finding shelter for in many place belt of high rush bordered lake entering one of for little distance pressing down lot of rush to make dry bed on damp earth lad lay down be soon fast asleep sun be blazing high overhead when awoke eye be hot be jim tucker first exclamation be enough to roast fellow alive be hot jack agreed worst of be there be anything to eat there be not likely to be jack replied till get to alexandria there be gun of fleet still at be evident that fort have not surrendered see how can possibly get along past fort on beach to west a long a hold out besides be not likely that there have be landing from ship yet rabble of alexandria will be plundering killing will be safer anywhere than there so must jack agreed there be one thing quite certain can not stop here without food water might perhaps do without grub for day two certainly not without water there be maize grain ripe in field so will do well enough for eating suppose must have well people must drink here jack suppose there must be well jack said doubtfully see water in lake be salt must say get fresh water anywhere near because ground be so sandy rather expect get in small channel from fresh water canal well anyhow can get water there arthur hill said vote go back there again not of course anywhere near where egyptian be though know whether must make much difference for must be on one side of canal on other still have better go beyond then can a say keep ourselves going by picking maize corn can find for day two till hear firing cease there be sure to be boat somewhere on lake jack said might get hold of one go across to alexandria night reconnoitre if find there be sailor troop there can take to boat pull back again think must be better to do than to try to work round by sea shore for believe have fortification running across from sea to lake so a to prevent place from being attacked by force landing beyond fort well vote set out at once jim tucker said be frightfully thirsty there be very few house a far a can see if keep sharp look out ought to be able to manage so a not to meet anyone if peasant doe run against ask question so much worse for others agreed at once started across country be only cultivated here there laid course so a to strike canal at point mile higher up than at have left only saw few peasant in field made detour so a not to come near of on way picked dozen head of maize be too thirsty to attempt to eat after three hour walking vegetation became brighter greener cultivated field thicker in half hour stood on bank of canal went down to edge knelt down took long drink must like dip arthur hill said will have one arthur when get dark must never do to bathe now see soul about still someone might come up on further bank at moment white skin must betray at once now have have good drink can hold on will go back again now sit down among bush eat corn when have finished meal boy agreed that maize eaten raw be not by mean desirable food however satisfied hunger sat discussing plan until evening agreed that arthur hill plan be certainly best will give one more day jim tucker said vote stop here to night then have good drink in morning then start back again keeping along canal here until be close to lake then will have good drink start out walk along lake until find boat then will hide away somewhere near cross after get dark be agreed that plan must be carried out after good night rest started again next morning kept down by foot of bank of canal followed until saw lake stretching away on left then went up have drink hurrah arthur hill exclaimed a picked up broken earthenware pot have apparently be thrown out by passing boat will hold quart of water will give drink to night a walked have heard heavy gun still booming over sea felt by mean certain that troop have yet landed however determined not to put off expedition across lake if must find boat carrying jar of water carefully with struck across to lake followed a before keeping careful look out for boat have proceeded about two mile along edge when saw stern of boat projecting beyond rush fringed water edge pushing more rapidly forward came upon beaten path through reed following came upon low flat boat very roughly constructed be not much of craft jim tucker said will do for capitally now have only to lie down take thing quietly until dark fancy be about three o'clock in afternoon now by sun lay down among clump of bush short distance from lake a soon a sun have set went back to boat again have already made meal have finished maize water stood by boat waiting until must become perfectly dark looking across tranquil sheet of water at distant town over smoke still hung heavily a sky darkened flash of fire must be seen be at last just going to get on board when heard exclamation of surprise behind looking round saw two native who have evidently come down with intention of going out in boat chapter xiii among friend astonishment of two native at seeing a supposed three woman standing with boat be le than of boy at being thus suddenly surprised suspecting harm however at once moved forward asking in egyptian what be doing here with boat down with boy jim tucker exclaimed at once threw upon one of boatman while jack arthur instantly sprang upon other wholly unprepared for attack men be thrown down almost without resistance get rope from boat arthur jim tucker exclaimed leaving jack to hold prostrate man arthur hill jumped on board boat in minute returned with two piece of rope with arm leg of native be soon firmly tied now what be going to do next jim tucker asked must not do to leave here jack said if managed to untie other must give alarm if have to come back must be caught if must not manage to untie other might lie here die think have better take with suppose will be best plan jim agreed know that will make much difference in end for must be left tied somewhere still must certainly make safer for accordingly men be lifted into boat laid down in bottom then boy threw off female garment taking long pole punted boat out into lake water be so willow that be not until have gone more than mile from shore that laid in pole took to clumsy oar hour rowing shore began to rise high in front of a approached stopped rowing listened attentively now before go nearer have better gag fellow jack said if be to set to to shout a soon a have landed chance of getting back again must be at end tore off two strip from cloth rolled up put in prisoner mouth putting lashing across so that must not get out then put men so far apart in boat that must not touch other lashed in position done again wrapped in woman garment quietly rowed to shore have little fear of finding anyone here native if landing have be effected from ship must be engaged in work of plundering while if english have taken possession of town must probably be keeping in house one be near when landed fastening head rope of boat to stone pushed gently off again if anyone must come along jim said be too dark for to see fellow lying in boat now must take bearing accurately a go along so a to be able to find boat again if thing go wrong with have landed mile beyond town now made way towards a came to house few people be about one paid attention to three veiled figure glare of light be sufficient indication to of direction must follow for have agreed that if landing have be made sailor must be certain to be at work trying to put stop to spread of flame presently came to edge of district swept by fire wall for most part be standing although in many case have fallen across road heap of rubbish inside still glowed

wild wave a soon a have unloaded cargo from italy be chartered for calcutta via cape fortnight after arrival at home jack be again summoned to rejoin ship wild wave be again fortunate in weather during early part of voyage when off cape encountered heavy gale jack have never before seen storm at sea accustomed a be to short choppy wave at mouth of thames be astonished at size of now beheld seemed to a large in comparison to size of barque a have before seen be to of smack for three day vessel lay to fortunately glass have given notice of approach of storm upper spar have be sent down vessel got under snug canvas before struck therefore rode out gale with farther damage than carrying away of part of bulwark loss of hen coop various other of deck gear a soon a gale abated sail be made continued on course glad be over eh master robson sailmaker joe culver said to jack a be leaning against bulwark on evening after storm have subsided looking at reflection of setting sun on glassy slope of long swell be still heaving joe culver a be always called on board old joe be character have sailed a man boy over fifty five year on board ship belonging to firm now although sixty seven year old be still active hearty be legend among sailor old joe have not changed in slightest degree from time be entered in ship book a boy old joe be like figure head of ship sailor said one day got carved out of wood when be little though have got dinted about bit ai never changed nothing to speak of if must paint up bit must be a good a new joe must have gone into quarter on shore with pension year before for long service have made marked character while other sailor came went in service of firm fact that name have be on book for so long period with two break have made sort of historical character at end of long voyage be always expected to show at office to have few word with head of firm be still rated a able seaman with extra pay a sailmaker be never expected to go aloft in other respect must still do work must turn out new sail alter old one a well a sailmaker on board mr godstone fleet a captain murchison remarked to owner when saw that joe be voyage to form one of crew old fellow must be worth pay if never put hand to work keep crew in good humour with yarn story if there be grumbler on board always manages to turn laugh against to show to others in true light a skulker sneak look after boy put up to duty act generally a father to man like attached to owner always cheerful good tempered ready to make best of everything to do work to best of power be very valuable man on board ship always feel that thing will go on comfortably forward when see joe culver name down in article be grand joe jack replied in answer to question though be very awful have idea that storm must be anything like wave so high have seen storm on own east coast seemed bad enough be nothing to be nothing to storm have seen in latitude master robson have doubled cape two score of time must say eh more than coming going have seen storm here to have just blown over be capful of wind why sir have seen ship laid on beam end when be not showing rag of canvas even when have cut mast away pressure of wind on hull kept down until thought that must never right again altogether have be wrecked eight time three of be down in 'ere latitude say a name have be on book of firm for fifty five year ai quite correct for twice be written off with dd after somehow other turned up again just a see one of 'ere business happened hereabouts must like to hear about awfully joe well sir seeing be not what may call everyday sort of affair a perhaps yarn might give hint a might be useful to if ever get into same kind of fix mind if tell just at present have not finished work if other two young gent like to come forward here at six bell will tell about chapter xvi old joe yarn at seven o'clock three lad gathered round old sailor forward joe having got pipe to draw to satisfaction proceeded to relate story of shipwreck happened said on very first v'yage made a ab proud be a may guess have done at last with being ordered here ordered there kicked here cuffed there be just twenty one then a active hearty young chap a must want to see not over big know spare in flesh a strong active a on board ship well came on to blow just about same latitude where storm struck other day much heavier never saw worse sky in v'yges when blow came seemed to there be end of everything at once need not tell about storm just take last one pile up about ten time have got although be ready prepared for have snugged down till scarce showed rag of sail over went at first blow till thought a be going to turn turtle cut away main mizzen at last got before run gale blew for ten day right on end sea be tremendous over over again be pooped bulwark be carried away boat smashed caboose pretty nigh everything else on deck swept clean off five of hand have be washed overboard three men be down below badly hurt first mate have leg broke be pretty well exhausted a may guess where 'd got to none knew for have never have glimpse of sun since gale began must not have made much difference if have because see must hing just run before wind wherever liked to take knew anyhow have got down into high latitude for gale have be blowing pretty steady from north west air got bitterly cold of sudden though must not see above mile anywhere round be pretty sure be in neighbourhood of ice towards afternoon of tenth day weather cleared just little though wind seemed a high a ever caught sight of big berg captain who be a good sort a ever sailed have done best all along to keep up spirit cook have be washed overboard in caboose skipper have kept steward at work boiling water over little spirit stove have aft kept supply of hot coffee there at hour for with biscuit have got on fairly well now told that thought gale must soon blow out that a soon a abated enough to set rag two of sail must try bring up under lee of berg be to be have just struck four bell there be gleam of daylight be at helm with captain who have never lain down for above hour at time since gale began beside suddenly saw become lighter ahead just like gray shadow against blackness have just noticed when skipper cried out 'good god there be berg straight ahead be over with then gave shout hand on deck ' there be nothing to do must not have changed course point if have tried ever so much berg a must see in minute stretched right away on side of 'you can leave helm joe ' say skipper have done men must do be in god hand now went forward with rest for knew well that only chance be to get on to berg when struck did not seem much of chance be wonderful how one cling to hope of few hour more life be not five minute from time when first saw gray shadow ahead that struck crash be tremendous mast snapped off a if be pipe stem whole front of ship seemed stove in believe that more than half of gathered forward be killed either by fall of mast by breaking up of bow bowsprit be driven aft through bit against stump of foremast did share in work be standing in fore chain having got over there to avoid fall of mast though be holding tight to shroud be well nigh wrenched from hold there be one terrible cry then ship seemed to break up a if be glass be in water great wave came thundering down on seemed to a if be being carried right up into air then felt shock be sometime before knew anything more when came to myself be daylight for bit must not move thought rib be staved in at last after much trouble made shift to work out found be about fifty foot above water wave have carried upon crest a swept up face of berg just a be at highest have by god mercy jammed in between two pinnacle of ice though daresay others have swept up a high none of have moved sat for time dazed stupid then began to take view of position ship be gone there be not sign of bit of floating timber of messmate suppose wreckage have be swept away by current iceberg have reckon be floating long time for be seamed over with crack crevice have be up under pretty hot sun before long gale blew south surface be rough honey combed did not feel a grateful a ought to have done lad have be cast up for saw nothing death before thought that must have be better to have died when lost sens in water than to have to die again a be by cold hunger on berg however set to to climb over berg down to other side so a to get under lee took two three hour of hard work by end of time clothes be dry got spirit hope in again once over there be pretty comfortable berg sheltered from wind sun began to shine out bit through cloud in afternoon although be still blowing hard there be blue sky overhead there be good many other berg in sight none of seemed near a big a one be on fortunately have couple of biscuit in pocket having thrust in there when ran up when there be call for extra hand at helm one of ate then lay down on broad ledge went off sound asleep when awoke be night be warmly clad when struck having thick oil skin over pea jacket felt bit cold however be soon off again when awoke morning have broken ate half last biscuit took drink out of pool know whether be melted ice rain water then climbed up to top of berg looked round have not expected to see sail did for be far out of track of ship still be just possible one might have be driven south a have be wind have pretty well dropped now sea be going down must see by small berg near that be driving through water at good rate when great mountain of ice like know get way on will keep for mighty long time did not make much difference to way be going have only biscuit left chance of getting more sat down wondered how long must last whether must not be easier to go down jump off into water than to sit there die by inch a be thinking be looking at what have taken for big berg away in distance right on course be making suddenly came to that be not same colour a others looked up to see if there be bit of cloud anywhere about might have thrown into shadow there be at last felt sure that be no iceberg at island jumped on foot now quick enough island must be better than berg anyhow there might be shell fish fruit though fruit did not seem likely so far south bird seal have heard tale from others a to island in south sea though knew well enough must not find cocoa nut such like thought might get hold of something with to make shift to hold on until whaler happened to pas along for hour two stood watching at end of time be sure be land also that be driving pretty straight towards a got near must see be big island stretched right across course be still long way off felt sure must ground somewhere in night for have heard that iceberg drew tremendous lot of water be two three time a deep below surface a be above be two three hundred foot high so unless water kept deep right up to island must take ground good way off when got dark went down on other side of berg for have sense enough to know just in same way a mast of ship went straight forward when struck pinnacle of berg must go toppling down towards island when grounded be hungry enough can tell that day kept last half biscuit until morning so a to give strength to swim dosed off for bit about eight bell a near a can guess heard deep grating sort of noise then felt rising up went higher higher till began to wonder whether there be chance of berg turning over there be noise like thunder a piece of ice broke off went crashing down other side then slowly began to sink down again must say for hour berg rolled up down then went off to sleep a may guess be on top of berg at daybreak saw have drifted into big bay have grounded about midway cliff in most place rose sheer up out of water here there there be break must see that land beyond be rough desolate looking ate last half biscuit then made way down to water edge shore seemed to about mile away longish swim in cold water be good swimmer sea between berg land be a smooth a pond took off clothes put in middle of oil skin wrapped round tying one of stocking round neck of bag to keep together have bought oil skin just before started on voyage knew that must keep out water tidy must not get down nearer than twenty foot of sea so dropped bag in then jumped a have hoped thing floated light pushed before a swam found that by putting hand on must keep up well when wanted to rest however did not want much of that water be too cold to be idle in never stopped swimming until got to shore at point have marked out a easiest to land on be long opening bag getting into thing be perfectly dry first thought be of food while have be swimming thought sort of barking noise be long in seeing that there be lot of seal on rock picked up goodish chunk of stone then lay down set to crawling towards have heard from sailor who have be whaling that way to kill seal be to hit on nose kept in mind a crawled up did not seem to notice got close among without moving then jumped up there be young seal lying not ten foot from before have time to turn smashed down bit of rock between eye there lay dead raw seal flesh ai sort of food a must take for choice be too hungry to think about cooking ate a big meal a ever have in life up till then have really thought a there be chance of being saved in long run now felt a there be for first time felt really grateful have not shared in fate of messmate knelt down thanked god for having brought safe to shore then set to to climb up to top of cliff be hard work a afterwards found have just hit by god mercy on only spot on part of island where must have got up for in most place cliff rose pretty near straight up four five hundred foot above sea when got to top saw that there be mighty high hill covered with snow to south east might have be fifteen twenty mile away be dreary kind of country rocky desolate with tuft of thin grass growing in crevice of rock saw that there be precious little chance of picking up living there that if be to get grub be to sea must look for thought best thing to do be to try find out sheltered sort of cove where perhaps might find bit of cave for knew that when winter came on there must be chance for in open so set out to walk brought up with big hunk of flesh must last for three four day what have got to look for be fresh water walked day keeping along pretty close to edge of cliff found plenty of little pool of rain water among rock did pretty well be not hungry enough to tackle raw flesh night have nothing to make fire with have got match in pocket in tight fitting brass box have kept dry there be fuel next morning started again after walking for four five hour came to spot where cliff broke away sudden getting to edge saw that there be narrow bay stretching way up into island hour walk brought to head here a have hoped found little stream running down into when find bay most time will find water running in at head ground sloped gradually here in great terrace rock be hard black looked a if have be burnt have heard since that be what call volcanic being so sheltered there be more thing growing here wherever little earth have gathered saw thing for world like cabbage made up mind to try when got chance with seal meat at last got down near water just at head of bay be shelving shore along at side a far a must see be rocky there be plenty of seal here too along on beach on rock on terrace be quantity of bird penguin a knew from what have heard of did not try to get out of way just made angry sort of noise ' will talk to presently hearties said 'what have got to do now be to look for shelter be end of april knew that must not be long before winter must be upon if be not out of by time must soon be frozen stiff did not go near seal for did not want to frighten looked about rest of afternoon next day must not find what might properly call cave so determined to make use of best place must fix upon be spot in lower terrace in face of rock seemed a if lower part be softer than upper be black hard almost like glass underneath rock have crumbled away perhaps six foot in depth soft rock be about four foot thick be more gone in place than others chose spot where hole be about eight foot long made up mind to close up front of just leaving hole big enough for to crawl in out first of brought up big stone built wall filled up crevice with tuft of grass then brought up smaller stone piled against shooting in sand from beach till have made regular solid bank four foot thick against wall then levelled bottom of cave with sand spread thickly with dried grass took five day hard work there be difficulty about food have only to go pick up few stone go among penguin knock over made shift to cook over fire made of dry tuft of grass have be careful not to disturb seal did not want of until weather got cold enough to freeze flesh thought of oil from blubber have nothing to hold when have finished hut began to hunt about to see if must find drift wood must only find few piece in cove gave up for did not see how must anyhow keep up fire through winter then bethought that penguin must furnish with feather set to work at with earnest in week have filled cave two foot deep with feather day must feel that got colder at night there be sharp frost so determined now to set to at seal there be none of sort that get fur from there be not much warmth to be have from skin still must do to block up entrance to den killed five six of found that of young one be furry enough to make coat of a be sitting on ground by next morning lamenting have nothing to boil down blubber in idea struck might use blubber a candle sticking wick into set to work stripped blubber off seal cut in square of about six inch then got bit of one of fresh skin bent up round of right size for square to fit into fastened spread on rock to dry thought of how be to make wick bothered must not spare clothes at last after trying different thing found that of grass be very tough put bundle of in pool let lay there for week for be north of ireland boy knew how worked flax at end of time took out let dry then bruised between flat stone found that have tough fibre thanked god picked lot more of put to soak may guess tried experiment night made six big wick put in one of cake of blubber lighted found that burned famously gave out lot of heat killed more seal by time winter set in in earnest have stock of meat enough to last for month two three hundredweight of cake of blubber have made several bowl plate out of seal skin have fashioned in mighty rough way suit of young seal skin with hood covered head face except just mouth eye from first have eaten cabbage regular with food must not cook because have nothing to boil water in be rather bitter to eat raw be better than nothing with flesh knew that must eat green food if wanted to keep healthy among drift wood have luckily found couple of broken oar to have fastened with seal sinew two sharp strong bone made very fair spear by end of may ground be covered deep with snow cold set in bitter what have bothered most of be where be to store stock of frozen meat blubber knew that there be chance of bear coming that must scent out however might hide at last determined to put in hole something like have made into den for hole be not like mine on level with ground be on face of smooth cliff about forty foot high made rope of seal skin fastened to projection in rock over hole lowered down found place must do well be quite big

be very seldom passed within sight of island at sailor be not fond of land except when be actually going to make port further keep away from better be pleased such splendid weather a must have thought must have made difference jack said must be glad if be going to coast up whole way why have have nothing gentle regular wind ever since storm off cape yes may not last way jack mr timmins a walked past overheard lad word said there be place in world where have more furious cyclone than in bay of bengal happily come very often perhaps there be only one really very bad one in four five year when there be one destruction be awful island be submerged sometimes hundred of square mile of low country flooded village washed away frightful loss of life have be in one two sharp blow up bay never in cyclone have be in one in china sea be bad enough in conscience wind fell lighter a made way up coast kept well out from land have not sighted since leaving ceylon so light be wind that be day before mr timmins told that be now abreast of madras how much longer will be before be at mouth of hoogley sir depends upon wind lad with strong breeze aft will be there in three four day if have calm may be a many week week of light baffling wind then breeze died away altogether there be dead calm sun poured down with great force sky be le blue clear than usual at night be stiflingly hot next morning sun again rose over sea a smooth a sheet of glass wonder what captain two mate be talking about so seriously jack said a three lad leant against bulwark in shadow of mainsail expect be wondering whether pitch wo melt off bottom jim tucker said with laugh what will happen if crew be baked alive be sure be pretty well a hot a oven sky look rather queer colour jack said looking up can hardly call blue at be more like dull gray than blue arthur hill said what be up wonder captain have disappeared in cabin on coming out have said few word to mr timmins who at once went to edge of quarter deck shouted hand to shorten vessel be under cloud of canvas for sail must draw have be set upon to make most of light puff of wind of young seaman looked a if must hardly believe ear at order jack heard one of older sailor say to mate a ran up ratline what did tell hour since bob that like enough must have scarce rag on by sunset lad sprang up ratline with men for took share of duty aloft arthur place be in mizzen jim in main jack in fore top stunsails be first got in then royal topgallant sail men be working well captain voice came up loud from quarter deck work steady lad work can minute be of consequence jack looked round horizon must see nothing to account for urgency sun be nearly overhead ball of glowing fire yet jack thought le bright than usual for must look at steadily circle be clear well defined from point right away down to horizon dull heavy looking sky stretched away unbroken by single cloud a soon a topgallant sail be furled upper spar be sent down then course be clewed up two of jib taken off close reef topsail be next order when be done men after more than hour work descended to deck drenched with perspiration ship be under easiest possible canvas nothing three closely reefed topsail fore staysail small jib mr hoare third mate have be aloft with men a soon a be on deck work of coiling away rope ranging light spar tidying up began chapter xviii cyclone what on earth be about arthur hill asked comrade a three boy gathered together after work be done why there be not breath of wind be done for practice do think jim shook head expect be going to have one of cyclone mr timmins be speaking about other day though see sign of except queer colour of sky expect glass must have be going down very fast there be captain popping into cabin again well be not long about added a captain murchison hurried out again spoke to mr timmins who immediately gave order furl mizzen main topsail lower down fore staysail well there ca be more to do now jack said when order be carried out unless set to work to set again look jack arthur hill said grasping arm pointing away on starboard beam wall of black mist seemed to hang upon horizon rising momentarily higher higher squall be coming lad captain shouted when strike hold on for life carpenter put man with axe at of weather shroud may have to cut away before have done with eye be now turned towards bank of cloud be rising with extraordinary rapidity small portion of upper line seemed at time to be torn off to rush ahead of main body then to disappear suddenly blown into fragment low moaning sound be heard line of white must be made out at foot of cloud bank water around ship be still a smooth a glass though there be slight swell swayed to fro caused shroud block to rattle louder louder grew murmur again captain voice be heard hold on for life lad then with scream roar a of thousand railway whistle gale struck ship so tremendous be force although closely reefed fore topsail be only sail that wild wave be showing aloft for jib blew from bolt rope instant squall struck vessel heeled over over until lee rail be under water further further went until end of yard be under water sea seemed to jack who be holding on by weather bulwark a if be directly under foot illustration caught in cyclone thought that ship be going to capsize have not cargo be well stowed must have done so be now almost on beam end pressed down by action of wind upon hull rather than mast have not be that boy have at last moment twisted rope round body must have dropped into water for deck afforded hold to foot jack felt completely bewildered at noise fury of wind have thought that after gale have passed through south of cape knew what bad weather be be beyond anything of have slightest conception looking round saw mr timmins clinging to bulwark making way along with greatest difficulty until reached sailor stationed with axe at mizzen shroud saw man rise from crouching position holding on to bulwark strike three blow on lanyard then there be crash mizzen mast broke suddenly off four foot above deck fell into sea jack thought that vessel lifted little for must see one more streak of deck planking mr timmins looked round towards captain who be clinging to wheel latter waved hand mate again began to make way forward passed boy without word for loudest shout must have be inaudible in howling of wind stopped at main shroud again axe descended mainmast went over side relief from weight of mast pressure of wind upon be immediate wild wave rose with surge lee rail appeared above surface then rose further mr timmins looked back again at captain latter made sign must see that pressure of wind upon foremast be beginning to pay vessel head off before a did so slowly righted until when fairly before wind be upon level keel then there be dull explosion heard even above gale fore topsail split into ribbon ship be now before gale be scudding from effect of wind on bare pole hull alone at great speed through water a soon a have righted lad threw off lashing still clung tight to rail struggled aft till stood under shelter of poop be something like jim roared at top of voice into jack ear even then word must scarcely be heard jack nodded at present even have conversation be possible must have have inclination for for felt stunned bewildered have taken place in ten minute be that time since ship have be lying motionless on still ocean now be rushing with one mast only standing before furious gale have have narrowest possible escape from destruction a yet sea have scarce begun to rise seemed flattened under terrific pressure of wind scooped hollow in drove water before in fine spray jack have read in paper about tornado in america how house be sometimes bodily lifted with content carried long distance how everything above surface be swept away a if scythe have passed over have heard account discussed by fisherman general opinion in leigh be that there be mighty little truth in leigh men thought knew what gale be what must do knew chimney pot tile must be carried distance with wind that arm of tree must be twisted off that empty boat must be carried considerable distance that house must be bodily whirled away be going so far beyond anything came within experience a to be wholly disbelieved jack knew now a looked round that more be possible felt whole vessel leap quiver a gust struck with only one bare pole standing must have be scarce surprised now have ship be lifted bodily from water a to walking along deck must have be impossible man must have forced way against wind jack felt be to attempt to move from sheltered spot where be standing must be taken up carried away a if be figure of straw presently mr hoare came down from poop dived into cabin making sign to lad to follow stood there for minute panting with exertion captain have sent down for spell said first jack moore be lashed to wheel sometimes thought that four of wheel must have be blown right away well lad be cyclone may live hundred year never see such have better stop in here for might get blown right away can be of good on deck there be nothing to do wind have got will take where like can hing keep straight there will be tremendous sea up before long water at upper part of bay be willow will have sea like yours at mouth of thames jack only on big scale life be in god hand boy forget to ask for help where alone can be obtained now must be going up again steward give glass of weak grog biscuit do know lad side fairly ache once twice be pressed against wheel with such force must scarcely breathe if have be pinned there by elephant butting must not have be more powerless be right steward get oil skin sou ' wester from cabin have better get kettle on over spirit stove so that can have cup of hot cocoa when like now then be ready for fray again buttoning closely up mr hoare went on deck again jack moore be next to come down captain order steward be to have glass of grog well young gentleman be gale mistake have be at sea over thirty year have never seen anything to be compared with if get through need never be afraid of not if live to be white headed after jack moore have gone up mr timmins captain came down by turn took cup of cocoa said few word to boy be indeed almost too much exhausted by struggle through have gone to be able to speak boy gathered again under lee of poop watched scene have changed considerably wind seemed a violent a ever sea be no longer kept in subjection to be now tossing in wild confused manner half hour have settled in sort of regularity be sweeping before wind in deep trough like wave with steep side resembling to jack have be accustomed in sea reach on gigantic scale soon again be broken up be succeeded by wild tumultuous sea like boiling cauldron vessel be thrown violently from side to side taking water over now on one beam now on other at time shaking from blow a if have struck upon rock so sharp sudden be movement that lad must not keep foot again made way into cabin even here be necessary to shout in order to be heard what extraordinary sea jim never saw anything like before be what be from jim replied pointing to tell tale compass hanging from beam overhead jack glanced at why be running due south aye expect have be two three time round compass already be what make frightful broken sea well a long a keep on running round round jack said there be fear of running against land anywhere jim be further advanced in study of navigation forget said centre of cyclone be moving along time though may go round round centre be moving in same direction a cyclone be going whatever may be for hour storm raged without slightest sign of abatement sea be now terrific waist of ship be full of water green sea swept over vessel bow carrying everything before pouring aft burst open cabin door deluged cabin by turn boy made way to door looked out come out fellow jim tucker shouted after one of trip of investigation men be coming out from fo'castle there be something to be done boy came out crawled few step up poop ladder holding on for life a did so did not attempt to get on to poop for felt must be blown away if exposed there to full force of wind looking round scene be terrible surface of sea be almost hidden by cloud of spray blown from head of wave sky be inky black hung overhead sea save for white head be of similar hue ahead there seemed gleam of light jim tucker holding on by rail raised two three foot higher to have better view moment be sufficient sprang down again shouted in comrade ear breaker ahead needed further word light ahead be gleam of sea of white foam towards vessel be hurrying nothing must be done to check change course have mizzen be standing effort might have be made to show little sail upon bring head up into wind to anchor even must have be done cable must have snapped like pack thread there be nothing for destruction jack followed jim example crawled to top of gangway holding on by poop rail raised to foot looked forward right across bow stretched band of white breaker beyond through mist must make out line of low shore lad descended again into waist with great difficulty made way forward to where men be huddled together round entrance to fo'castle too have kept look out knew of danger into be running impossibility of avoiding be there anything to be done jim tucker shouted silent shake of head be sufficient answer vessel in be doomed officer be now seen leaving helm coming forward be proof in of hopelessness of prospect vessel be indeed steering straight before gale a there be regular following wave there be fear of broaching to boat have at commencement of storm be hanging from davit be gone useless one two have be smashed to piece by heavy sea striking others have be torn from fastening blown clean away long boat alone remained lashed amidships on deck jack pointed to old sailor shook head pointed to sea boat must hope to live in minute once in breaker must be swamped instantly officer made way forward be over lad captain shouted of may reach shore on piece of wreck a break up will get long boat ready for launching of may cling to now lad let shake hand round meet fate a british sailor must do calmly bravely at rate of may be saved yet crew of wild wave have be happy one discipline have be good although indulgence have be allowed men be fond of officer there be silent hand clasp round then of sailor followed officer to boat a did so knew well that order be given merely to keep employed for chance of anyone being washed ashore reaching alive through tremendous surf be small indeed a cut away boat cover looked round low cry broke from several of ship be close to broken water man clung to something awaited shock in few second came a descended wave there be tremendous shock followed instantaneously by crash a foremast went over bow accompanied time with sound of rending timber cut away lashing of boat captain shouted drawing knife setting example a did so touched jack pointed into bottom of boat lad understood be to put in plug at ordinary time be left out to allow rain water to escape a fell jack in turn touched arthur two climbed into boat to replace plug a did so fiercer gust than usual struck vessel lashing of long boat have just be cut gale seized raised in air a if have be made of paper jack arthur uttered cry involuntarily clung for life to thwart over over be whirled confused giddy scarce knowing what have happened clung on be sort of nightmare how long lasted knew not presently there be terrific crash knew more chapter xix cast ashore when jack opened eye lay for time wondering where be what have become of there be star in sky overhead light be stealing over felt that be daybreak there be loud dull roaring sound in ear sound must not understand for not even breath of wind fanned cheek at last slowly fact came to mind there have be great storm vessel be among breaker have got into long boat with arthur to put in plug have be lifted up blown away then suddenly jack sat upright be light enough for to see that be still in boat back be broken side staved in around be mass of tangled foliage close beside lay arthur hill blood slowly oozing from terrible gash in forehead jack leaned over raised loudly shouted name in ear with sigh arthur opened eye what be jack asked feebly be saved old man have be blown right ashore in boat have got shaken hurt bit thank god be alive where be arthur asked looking round a far a can see jack replied be in middle of grove of tree have be blown down by gale leaf branch have broken fall otherwise must have be smashed up must have be lying here for last ten hour be just about six o'clock when struck for looked at clock in cabin last time be down there a sun will be up before long must be getting on for five now now let try to get out of with greatest difficulty for be still weak terribly shaken boy made way through tangle of tree branch into have so providentially fallen uttered exclamation of surprise a reached edge of wood sea be nearly mile away tremendous surf be still breaking for quarter of mile out band of white breaker extended along shore there be sign of wild wave scarce speaking word made way down to shore with faint hope that of comrade might have be thrown on strand alive few bit of broken timber alone showed that wreck have taken place rest have probably be swept by current up down coast walked for mile then stopped sea here have made clean breach over land extended a far a eye must reach retracing step be again stopped by similar obstacle then went inland passed round grove of fallen tree looked landward a far a must see stretched broad sheet of water broken only by branch of fallen tree be evident that vast tract of country have be submerged by storm that what be now island upon stood have only be saved from similar fate by being few foot higher than surrounding country tree upon have be felled very surface of soil seemed to have be torn off by fury of gale scarcely word have be spoken from time first reached shore fate of shipmate have depressed profoundly a yet must scarcely feel grateful for own escape jack be first to rouse from state of despondency well arthur said thing look very bright must hope for best at rate let thank god for having rescued in marvellous manner seems almost miracle boy be bareheaded cap having be blown away at commencement of gale now stood with bended head for minute silently thanking god for preservation now arthur jack said cheerfully let go down to water see how fast be sinking be running like sluice into sea at end of island suppose that will be many hour before be gone a soon a be must set out make way across to land beyond be sure to find village there to get sort of food after have be down to water vote go back to wood lie down in shade there sun will soon be unpleasantly hot a there be chance of getting drink sooner be out of better day passed slowly boy talked little when did so conversation turned entirely upon lost shipmate for subject occupied thought far more than present situation before night water have so far sunk that only glistening pool appeared where broad sheet of water have before spread arthur be suffering much from thirst must have started at once jack persuaded to wait until next morning may tumble into deep hole full of mud said must get on very slowly let have good night sleep start with first gleam of daylight will be able to get along fast then found however that be not very fast work for country have be cultivated soil be now converted into soft mud in sank up to knee here there a went on saw pile of mud sunburnt brick with timber projecting knew that marked site where village house have stood among clump of fallen tree saw bit of colour knew that be body of of native here there too saw carcass of bullock at last found ground under foot much firmer have be road jack said flood a went down have left three four inch of mud on be fairly firm underneath if can manage to keep on will get on well for six hour plodded on sometimes losing path floundering in deep mud at others regaining going along briskly at end of time mud be le deep in hour be beyond range of inundation here there tree be still standing after hour walking came to village house be unroofed many of levelled to ground wall of few be still erect native be moving about few be digging at ruined house apparently searching for remains of buried there evinced interest in arrival of two shipwrecked white boy being too utterly cowed broken to think of anything own misery there be well arthur at least expect be that jack said pointing to post upon be long pole with rope hanging from end in air hurried to spot for be suffering severely arthur be scarcely able to speak found to delight that jack surmise be correct one hauling up rope bucket full of water came to surface arthur be about to seize when jack said have better take thing arthur native might make row if drank from bucket arthur seized half gourd jack have picked up dipped into bucket handed to jack fire away man be worse than be jack replied gourd have to be refilled two three time before be satisfied then went back into village jack pointed to mouth made sign that wanted something to eat native shook head apathetically proceeded with work at last went up to old woman sitting in chair rocking backwards forward paid attention when jack addressed upon holding out shilling to manner at once changed hobbled into house returned with pile of flat cake made from native grain will do now jack said a munching away at bread tramped on must get to place sooner later where there be somebody who can talk english how much money have got arthur have got two pound arthur said took out of chest while gale be going on thought if be wrecked did get to shore might be useful wish have done same jack said have luckily got sovereign in pocket for be going to pay joe scale for six light canvas trouser made well three pound between be not bad have got four five shilling loose will do hope until get to place where can change gold walked on till sunset passing several other village by way of have suffered more le severely by storm be evident that a got further inland work of destruction have be le complete at sunset sat down in grove of tree still standing first have passed there spent night look good sized place jack said a late on following afternoon came in sight of what be evidently town of size will probably find someone there who can speak english after crossing bridge over river entered town addressed several people shook head pointed forward what do mean jack be sure know unless mean there be somebody farther on who speaks english presently came to large house several people be passing in out jack spoke to one of shook head pointed indoors must be right place arthur went into large room where two three native be sitting writing looked up in surprise at two travel stained english lad can of speak english jack asked one of at once left desk came forward can speak english what do want thank goodness jack exclaimed fervently be two officer belonging to english ship be wrecked in storm two day ago believe rest have be drowned have made way on foot across country be first person have met who can speak
