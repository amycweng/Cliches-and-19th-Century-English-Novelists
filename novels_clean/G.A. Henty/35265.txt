carriage then gave full vent to fury disappointment raved aloud cursed fortune connected with poured imprecation of kind description upon head of miss harmer last exclamation a flung down in corner of carriage be let beware for by will find if be in existence if cost life added after pause now resume own narrative how surprised be that evening when came in of course just at first be too much occupied in kissing harry whom now saw for first time a have only arrived from north evening before to notice anything strange about manner then papa introduced to mr petersfield after have spoken word two to have time to look at face saw that there be great gloom upon greater even than occasion warranted for have be expecting little joking remark from papa about being woman of property now so that be more struck by subdued expression of face be anything matter papa asked quietly yes dear great deal be matter be sorry to say mr harmer will be missing missing papa exclaimed almost incredulously yes love must not take too much to heart may come to light yet at present be missing sat down with faint feeling in heart be not that cared for money for own sake thought of lady desborough felt rush of coming trouble sweep round however after moment drove back feeling asked in a cheerful voice a must how be missing papa ah dear be rub mr harmer have in house now be nowhere to be found believe indeed there can be little doubt that miss harmer have concealed at rate that know where have be hidden away have noticed last week strange manner sort of secret understanding between sister thought little about at time now however can understand by light of present state of affair remember now what smiled at at time a impotent threat miss harmer said in passion that while lived sophy husband must never enter door of harmer place papa said have very good life income why must do thing a there be several reason dear will talk over after tea be hungry tired be sure mr petersfield harry be same so let have tea at once will do good will be able to look at matter in far more cheerful light afterwards what be going to give dear cold pie papa fresh boiled mackerel dish of prawn muffin capital now will go wash hand make ourselves comfortable by time will be ready for be soon down again seated round table papa began to question harry about work in north harry who be never depressed above five minute about anything entered into most amusing description of life on railway be laughing merrily in spite of trouble before tea be over be sure one who have looked in upon must have guessed that have day a good a lost l between when have done papa said there dear be hundred per cent better now a have taken one great consoler tea let take tobacco be sure harry be dying for pipe although often smoke indoors on special occasion will make exception what say mr petersfield be very fond of good cigar lawyer said producing cigar case will not miss ashleigh object not at said harry always smoke when be at home be quite accustomed to if find too much can easily open window little tea thing be soon cleared away took seat round fire for although weather be not actually cold usually have fire in evening a indeed by seaside one can do almost year round with comfort papa sat on one side on stool by harry next mr petersfield on other side a soon a cigar pipe be fairly alight table cleared alone papa began now dear will answer question asked before tea will do so at length a what be saying to may be sort of guide assistance to mr petersfield who from late partner mr ransome having have management of mr harmer affair doe not know very much of business papa then explained whole history of harmers nearly a have told although of course in far fewer word thus see concluded there be several reason may suppose actuate miss harmers first principal be religious question miss harmer be a have said educated in convent be brought up to have ever since lived life of ascetic severity have be taught to look upon advancement of church a thing to be striven for upon earth summum bonum to be aimed at be accustomed to consider harmer estate a destined to go to furtherance of object when herbert harmer by accidental death of two brother suddenly succeeded to looked upon a absolutely stolen from church to be by elder brother will to have gone then left house went abroad did not return until death of gerald harmer seemed again to open way for have since resided there off on in hope probably that brother might return to old faith might die without will in fact that unexpected contingency might happen last three four year since mr harmer declared intention relative to sophy have very much intermitted visit only returned on news of brother first paralytic seizure thus see last twenty year of life may be said to have be given to endeavour temptation to to suppress will be of course enormous in order that property may come to afterwards a eldest brother intended to romish church have besides motive now one doubt greatly soothes conscience be mercilessly severe upon sophy look upon a brother murderess therefore have twofold satisfaction of punishing so of avenging brother death of enriching own church strong inducement dear sir mr petersfield who be bachelor said religion malice two strongest motive power in female especially elderly female mind mr petersfield said remember that be here that be talking treason apologize humbly miss ashleigh said smiling really continued to papa what say explains whole matter give even more awkward appearance in eye than have before question be what be to be done what be to be done papa repeated be indeed difficult question to decide upon believe will to be in existence think will venture to destroy be one thing to allow will to lie hid in secret drawer to take out deliberately burn one requires very different degree of courage hardihood to other think will venture to destroy think will mr petersfield said quailed so unmistakably under denunciation do know doctor give great credit for that be grand sir lawyer rubbed hand at thought give word never saw anything better done in whole of professional experience harry laughed yes father actually alarmed at time be awfully impressive papa must not help smiling little be said well meant to be woman to be extremely superstitious have heard confess to belief in spirit apparition flashed across that best thing must do to prevent destroying will be to touch on score do think be safe for time one of worst feature to mind be appearance of father eustace where doe come from who sent for said have come from abroad a be italian must have telegraphed for think can find out harry said dick thornton who be one of telegraph clerk be at school with have doubt can get out of who message be sent to who sent even if can not get word do mr petersfield said that message might be of great value to by way mr petersfield papa said there be point have just occurred to may serve to guide materially in search do keep mr harmer deed paper not keep title deed of property sort of thing keep copy of tenant lease paper of kind to may have occasion to refer in dealing with why do ask question be very important one dear sir be pleased with answer how so lawyer asked rather puzzled in way if will have be only important document at harmer place might have be kept in of drawer searched to day miss harmer might have removed last week destroyed concealed in room in other place where must never find now have reason to believe be not so for in case must have left lease other document must have found be quite clear to mind then that mr harmer have secret place of concealment to alluded when told clerk that burglar in world must not find in place of concealment whole of paper together with will be stowed away miss harmer who doubt know of existence of place of concealment will be perhaps content to let remain there relying upon secrecy of hiding place will not be tempted to destroy will capital dear sir mr petersfield exclaimed energetically be quite right be indeed a say great point gained before have solitary document to look for might be contained hid away in small space drawer with double bottom woman desk sewed up in stay beg pardon miss ashleigh in fact in small out of way corner now have regular receptacle to look for capable of holding bulky document at rate good sized box be indeed great point gained there will be beyond doubt for think miss harmers face be quite sufficient evidence that be not destroyed besides may reasonably suppose that box be not concealed about miss harmer room be where be originally placed by brother question arises 'where deuce be that ' can guess where be said where other three exclaimed simultaneously in 'priest chamber ' wherever may be answered remember well that when be once talking to mr harmer about old time old house hiding place said that harmer place be celebrated a having one of snuggest hiding place in kingdom that many priest have lain hidden there for month asked if knew where be told that did for when boy have gone into on occasion other with father when came back took possession of house have again examined found snug hiding place that used a sort of strong room promised that day other must show to never thought to ask unfortunately never mentioned again by jove harry exclaimed will find yet while papa mr petersfield uttered exclamation of surprise satisfaction sure enough doctor will be in 'priest chamber ' only question be how be to find how be to get into when do must think there can be difficulty about harry said have to do be to go before magistrate swear that will be there get search warrant to examine for mr petersfield smiled must find great difficulty in getting warrant why so harry asked indignantly do mean to say that if knew there be will hidden in certain place will left property that must have right to go in search for must be very delicate matter indeed mr petersfield said very delicate still not impossible by statute of of george chapter s be enacted that if person will during lifetime after death of person steal for fraudulent purpose conceal will codicil other testamentary instrument will be guilty of misdemeanor being convicted thereof be liable to various punishment by same statute chapter s say if credible witness will prove upon oath before justice of peace reasonable cause to suspect that person have in possession on premise property whatsoever in respect to such offence such a stealing will c will have be committed justice may grant warrant to search for such property a in case of stolen good now by act be clear that warrant must be obtained upon affidavit that believed a do believe that will exists must not allow to pull house to piece be quite certain that in other way must discover chamber built for purpose of concealment say baffled priest hunter of old time men who be pretty well accustomed to finding of sort of hiding place who knew exactly where be likely to be situated must never find even while be searching for miss harmer might enter by secret door wherever may be abstract destroy will without being one bit wiser at rate must be certain after have given up hopeless search left to destroy will to prevent possibility of ever trying again with better fortune best course be to find out first where chamber be next how to get into when two point be discovered can arrange about going in taking possession of will without asking one leave in matter be believe only chance of recovering by strategy take one of servant into pay get to search for chamber leave to a of course be acquainted with of domestic know have anything more can suggest at present must anything strike will write from town a go by early train will now with permission retire to bed will of course write to immediately find out anything may seem to to have smallest bearing upon affair must especially advise that hint to one belief in existence of will a may get to miss harmer ear although if belief that search be being made for may be content to let remain for year concealed a at present may be assured must believe that be working to find priest will destroy at once agreed in propriety of following advice then separated for night next morning got up at six to make breakfast for mr petersfield before started be pleased at having done so have not much time for talk before went said honestly mr petersfield do think will ever find will honestly dear miss ashleigh be very much afraid never will be lamentable affair be certain in own mind that be in existence that place of concealment be known to miss harmer under circumstance of case feel assured that even on death bed there be chance of ever revealing where be only chance in mind be in finding hiding place direct energy to point find that chamber may be assured will find will when others came down to breakfast at nine o'clock proposed that must return at once to canterbury papa said that affair must cause so much talk excitement in place that must be quite overwhelmed with call from one have to repeat whole story dozen time day must be terrible infliction that a harry must be mostly out must have to bear whole brunt of attack so be settled that must stay there at rate week ten day longer until first stir excitement be over so papa harry went over day to canterbury remained quietly down at ramsgate for day brought back news of importance one day towards end of week papa came back to dinner alone harry did not arrive until nearly ten o'clock a came in told that have have long chat with friend thornton of telegraph office what have learnt harry asked will tell about dear directly have made comfortable proceeded with most provoking coolness to take off coat glove to arrange in chair before fire now will tell went down to station to day there saw dick thornton shook hand with said what one say 'this be bad job harry ' ' devilish bad job ' answered never mind expletive harry put in can imagine interrupt agnes wo tell anything ' want to have chat with thornton ' said can see ' ' get away from here till six ' suppose come round to place have chat with when get away ' 'done said accordingly have snug little dinner cooked got bottle of wine up from cellar at about half past six dick came in after have dined have talked over whole affair told must do great service by telling whether miss harmer have sent off telegraphic message if so where 'it must lose place if be known have told harry ' said ' know must ' answered what say will not go further indeed be more a matter of curiosity that may find out where priest came from than from action can take from ' 'well harry ' said ' will tell about can make what use like of place be not so first rate must care very much if did get sack in consequence one of servant from harmer place must say miss harmer own maid for be stiff foreign looking woman came down upon friday afternoon with note message be alone at time for other clerk happened to be away message be in italian be that made notice particularly when got home took trouble to get dictionary to see what be about must not make much of forget italian word english be to bishop of ravenna italy be dead much can be done if lawful for mother send advice assistance 'and did get answer asked 'yes answer came on sunday morning always attend there between half past nine half past ten be also in italian be lawful for mother advice aid have started ' father eustace to wit papa said be harry concluded that thornton told of course said be very much obliged to must take good care that never be known from whom got information now suppose mother talk of mean mother church who be bishop of ravenna remember papa said thoughtfully that about three year ago miss harmer said be delighted to hear that confessor visitor call of convent where formerly lived so many year where always stayed whenever went upon continent have just be made bishop only regret be that be to place in north of italy whereas convent be at florence remember fact specially because after sister have left room poor brother said to 'between doctor must have be much better pleased to have heard that excellent priest have received promotion to heaven man have have complete ascendancy over sister for many year be believe four five year younger than be at rate have be confessor whatever be of convent ever since be there twenty four five year ago be judge by what say gloomy fanatical man whose ambition be to do service to church suppose rise in at rate have complete ascendancy over by ascetic life devotion to church correspond with frequently can not help thinking that advice order given in letter whenever go over there do constantly have tended greatly to make gloomy unhappy woman be be be true brought up with extreme strictness austerity can not help thinking that much of must have worn off if have not be for man influence ' doubt papa continued mr harmer be right action be dictated by priest be who ordered to make friend with brother at gerald harmer death to come over here take up abode know be at convent when heard news that have announced intention of staying there permanently now have sent over father eustace man look religious enthusiast there be doubt that will never allow to change mind even be disposed altogether child be evident only remaining chance be to find out secret chamber if can discover well good if not will be wiser for painful a disappointment be to give up hope of finding will to endeavour to go on a if have never have existence be most unfortunate affair now sir john having died be indeed harry answered sir john must have pushed on must have have difficulty even without capital in making way sir john to whom papa alluded must say be engineer to whom harry have be articled harry time have run out now three four month be only remaining in north on small salary completing piece of work on be engaged old master have died only month before time when piece of work be finished harry have intended buying partnership in good business with l mr harmer have promised for purpose yes be very unfortunate having died harry said unless one have good patron of sort to push one on make up hill work of not that care much can fight way well enough harry stretched great shoulder looked a confident cheerful a if have just gained legacy instead of losing one will go back in two three day to work said will not last much more than month in meantime will be on look out for something else chapter ii swift retribution sophy gregory might have excited pity even in mind of enemy must have seen a lay pale sad in lonely room during long hour

danger in doing so than remaining here in present state of nervous anxiety be most essential that if possible mind must be relieved of present strain that must obtain intelligence a to last moment of adopted father tell that have seizure before be likely therefore that present attack be very sudden in case may not probably must not have said anything against alone must be relief to at rate must be pacified by knowing that be doing must to learn truth fear that brain fever will be termination of attack character may be modified if present anxiety be to extent allayed by applying to day at

make slight alteration know that did not destroy upon that morning be not to be found there be strong reason for supposing that miss harmer have concealed in case although may yet turn up still must look worst in face consider that be very probable that may never be heard of again in case must get nothing sophy asked eagerly not one penny sophy will go to miss harmer sophy closed eye leaned back with faint thank god looked upon a punishment a sort of atonement for fault then in instant fresh thought struck how must robert bear must love le now be penniless instead of being great heiress

get pupil for music begged to write to for be only person must hope to be friend to now of course answered letter from time kept up occasional correspondence papa told that in early letter to robert gregory have expressed determination to discover will at hazard that have now to certain extent acquiesced in papa view that unsuccessful attempt must be certain to prove signal for instant destruction of will that therefore nothing must be attempted unless success be pretty certain robert gregory be more obliged to acquiesce in decision a far a be personally concerned for be unable to appear in canterbury a must have be arrested if have done so returned from ramsgate a have agreed upon about fortnight after funeral harry having already left for north papa must still further have

a much a to say that have heard legend of priest chamber now sarah first thing want to discover be whereabouts of room can only be done in one way want exact dimension be to say measure height length breadth of room passage closet staircase in old part of house because a room existed in old time be only in central part of house be original building that secret chamber need be looked for when have got measurement put down upon paper will see where there be space to fill up do understand sarah did not quite understand so got sheet of paper drew rough plan of house explained matter more fully sarah understood now at once entered into with heart see said want exact position of door window chimney here be small pocket book pencil take one page for room mark down first in way extreme length breadth then position of door window thus put 'in small figure distance from other then showed small plan of harmer place have drawn from recollection of sarah understood perfectly what have to do make notch length of yard on handle of broom said measure exact length of bottom of apron with broom can get height of room with apron other measurement so that will be able to get size even if be disturbed one must have slightest idea of what be doing then asked to measure room be in to make little sort of plan of found so quick intelligent that felt certain must execute task with sufficient accuracy to enable to find out where secret room be situated two girl then took leave really felt strong hope in success of plan not indeed that be mine for be harry idea entirely only gave instruction have previously given after small packet arrived week sent by sarah through thomas to father containing seven eight leaf of pocket book in little more than month have measurement be enabled to make out entire plan in doing of course previous knowledge of house assisted greatly papa assisted in have not at first told anything of what be doing a wished that in case by chance scheme be detected must be able to say that knew nothing about at last however be obliged to let into secret when told be very much interested pleased think must ever have succeeded in putting part together certainly have never arrived at accurate conclusion without assistance when be done found blank space precisely where have anticipated that must do be difficult to explain exact position will endeavour to do so on entering house from front one found in large square hall from one side of library opened from other dining room opposite to front door be immense fireplace in still stood two large iron dog in in winter great wood fire always blazed on one side of fireplace grand staircase went up on other passage led down to room have originally be drawing room from window being at back of house have be long since turned into kitchen fireplace of room stood back to back to one in hall be in block contained in square formed by back of kitchen staircase passage that came to conclusion that secret room must be for even allowing for immense thickness of masonry there be yet large space unaccounted for on floor above there be also space directly over considerably larger than must have be required for chimney of hall kitchen fire even have there be two of there be not for sarah found that chimney of hall made almost right angle ran into kitchen chimney papa after going very carefully into measurement came to conclusion that room be situated nearly over hall fireplace that might be seven eight foot long by five six wide that must be little over six foot high thought be approached by short staircase opening into hall fireplace into one of bedroom above abutted on vacant space on floor one of room have be occupied by herbert harmer other have be be still miss harmer room indeed papa suspected entrance to exist a by in case of necessity provision must be so much more readily secretly supplied escape made in disguise from one exit must entrance be forcibly made at other be mere guesswork dear when there be so much ground to go upon a have got one can guess very closely indeed to truth where must think papa that entrance be most likely to be discovered most likely in hall fireplace back side if remember right be formed of iron with rude ornament upon mantelpiece too be of old oak be covered with carving undoubtedly in of secret spring be concealed hall be best place to try for reason early in morning at various time indeed sarah might search among ornament knob for spring if one came suddenly into hall presence there must appear only natural whereas in of bedroom especially that of mr harmer be not now in use must hardly be often without exciting suspicion sarah came on following saturday evening showed plan have made explained to where thought entrance be how be most likely to find secret spring sarah be much pleased with success have so far attended effort promised to find spring if existed said must get up hour before other servant try knob roughness on near grate however week after week rolled on saturday came message result week before christmas sent to say have tried possible place must not find sign of sent back in answer to ask to try stone brick a far up chimney a must reach with christmas polly came home from school time to stop for good for papa must not very well afford to keep at so expensive school a grendon house indeed wanted bright face happy laugh back again among papa practice be not very lucrative be large not good paying one great proportion of lay among lower class in serious case among be always ready to give time skill indeed for last three year since there be apparent certainty that must be so handsomely provided for papa have purposely given up much of paying practice many among upper class have habit of calling in medical man on slightest pretext like indeed to call regularly have hour chat on sort of subject time papa must not spare indeed know that said to two three of very best patient have nothing serious matter with all want be little occasional medicine good chat of day to do good cheer up have time to give when have dozen dying people waiting anxiously for send to harper be clever fellow know about everything will amuse more than do have large family money will be of use to if get seriously ill want will of course come to so papa have gradually withdrawn from much of paying practice have still income sufficient to keep comfortably be not nearly what have be four five year before however be quite content to work a did giving skill time to who most required be least able to pay for harry came home too little before christmas have finished last piece of work have now obtained appointment of l year to superintend railway in course of construction in north of ireland evening after christmas day received note from sarah saying that morning have in feeling up chimney found projecting knob immediately behind mantelpiece on pressing went into wall that time did so must hear click that must not find that anything else moved hurrah sarah harry shouted when read note aloud be on right track 'the king will enjoy own again sang in stentorian way really do begin to think be on track papa said must tell sarah that doubt there be other spring must be pressed together before after for generally there be two spring to old hiding place in case one must be touched accidentally told sarah who came on next sunday evening to see have rather began to despair before now that have found something tangible became quite enthusiastic said that be determined to find other spring if be year engaged in search be now certain that be right that secret chamber existed that entrance be there of neither of fact have be quite sure in own mind before chapter iv evil

under oath solemnly taken on bible under penalty of forfeiture of amount must condition not be strictly observed awaiting reply c c cecilia angela harmer what astonishment be to in what silent amazement looked at other when papa have finished reading letter one spoke for time at last papa said be very serious question dear offer ought to be thoroughly discussed before being accepted refused l be handsome provision for will start harry in good business will enable girl to marry well yet to feel that bring share to expense of household here papa glanced at saw at once that although have never spoken to on subject have yet thought good deal about engagement with percy then went on be bright side of picture now for reverse be unquestionably entitled to much larger amount who make offer be very people who be keeping out of then too condition about sophy be most repugnant a must naturally have wished in event of accepting sum to make at rate equal participator in with of yourselves matter be one must be thought over very seriously conclusion must be hastily arrived at talk over quietly together be question on must rather give opinion whatever leave to decide entirely by yourselves there be one thing papa have not mentioned polly said be that if take money must give up search for will can not accept miss harmer money then get servant to work against certainly dear that must of course be quite understood if accept money must give up further search for will dismiss idea of ever hearing of again there say more about now let have glass of wine nut after will go into study can talk over among yourselves when papa left drew round fire harry said first thing to be done be to smoke calumet of council accordingly in minute two be puffing cloud of smoke from immense meerschaum of be very proud now said council be begun let sister speak of took advantage of invitation sat looking steadily into fire polly who be now sixteen who have grown up very dear loveable girl be seated between in high backed old fashioned chair with foot on low stool have not hitherto described must not choose moment to do so in must look prettier than did a sat there with light on table behind shining on gold of hair face lit only by dancing light of fire be blonde hair looked almost brown in shadow when light fell on have still bright golden tinge one have admired when be child eye be pure blue complexion be bright clear have particularly lithe lissom figure small head be very gracefully set on neck shoulder be very lively full of fun indeed sometimes have to call to order be little positive wilful sometimes be very loving loveable girl be at present hardly a tall a be a have year to grow be very probable must be taller in time have very long eyelash nearly longest ever saw added greatly to effect of great blue eye mouth nose might have be better for that have grown into very pretty girl well girl what do think about offer of ours harry repeated finding that of answered own mind be pretty well made up on subject wished to hear what others thought so said what do think about harry harry did not seem more inclined to give opinion than have be for sat puffed out such huge volume of smoke polly threatened to take pipe away if did not smoke more quietly at last took from between lip began fact be girl be loath to give opinion not because have not one because wish to influence case be so very different from mine that there be comparison at between be now just twenty one be in position to keep consequently advantage sum of money must be to be not sufficient to counterbalance repugnance feel a far a be concerned to taking money from woman who have robbed still understand be not so much against a to decide to refuse must agree to accept be rather suggestion of mine a be than positive final opinion mean to say that for own sake certainly must not accept of offer be so differently placed that if give vote for accepting will be quite ready to agree with harry made unusually long speech for with difficulty must see personally be very strongly opposed to taking favour from miss harmer after way in have treated being quite of same opinion thought matter be settled a made sure polly must refuse when harry have done took puff two at pipe then turning to polly who be next to said now polly have heard have to say let have opinion for time sister polly did not answer sat gazing into fire with long lash nearly shading eye looking more womanly thoughtful than have ever seen before at last without moving lifting eye said think have better accept harry evidently surprised gave one two short puff at pipe be astonished have made sure that polly must of three be most indignant determined to reject offer for have be most bitter in invective at miss harmer money have at present particular value in eye however made remark expressive of surprise only said let have reason polly yes harry repeated let have reason polly be again silent little sat thoughtfully twining long taper finger one over other then without looking up asked be understood agreed between that two vote carry day certainly said knowing that vote must be on harry side quite so harry agreed if two girl make up mind that be best to accept offer a said before will offer objection well then harry say accept will tell why now although polly have not changed attitude spoke clearly firmly eye be fixed on fire with steady resolute look must agree not to interrupt till have done promise harry said looking rather puzzled at polly very unusual demeanour promise repeated amused rather surprised too very well polly said please remember that now harry be great big strong fellow know be hardly fit to entrust delicate business to that in affair of sort must know no more than child well miss polly harry said in astonishment taking pipe out of mouth be pretty cool hand to talk to elder what next wonder promised not to interrupt harry a said be very good kind know be not not so to say sharp must hardly help laughing harry eye opened so very wide in amazement at girl remark polly be looking so very serious earnest now woman woman indeed harry repeated yes woman polly continued unmoved have left school now be more of woman a far a thing go than be of man woman look very deeply into matter now there be only one of three who a stand at present will be greatly affected by gift say that l be not nice sum to have that might not day assist to get husband at present can manage very well without one must think so put in harry can get on without keep comfortably therefore to money have peculiar charm at present might be rather disposed to refuse than to accept a gift from people who have robbed of large sum there be good deal in harry be there not harry nodded have not yet sufficiently recovered from astonishment into position of superiority taken up by polly have thrown while on part must not fancy what be coming next well see harry have agreed that of be in position rightly to estimate value of l at present now agnes on contrary be in position to appreciate keenly here harry again opened eye looked at with such astonishment really thought must fancy that wanted money to pay off gambling debt something of sort agnes appreciate exclaimed of course polly said please interrupt so harry now l will in probability be turning point in agnes life future happiness unhappiness may depend upon let see how be situated be engaged to percy desborough thank goodness harry muttered to have said something can understand at last be engaged to be capital fellow for unless find will have l know know by face that may be year before marries desborough if ever doe so by george harry exclaimed taking pipe suddenly from mouth jumping up from chair by george if thought for moment percy desborough there will interrupt harry polly said looking for first time up from fire with little glance of amusement into angry face do sit down hear out will see that there be vengeance to be taken upon one harry looked more than half inclined to be very angry however resumed seat took short sulky puff at pipe fact be harry have heard of lady desborough from what have heard must know dear polly interrupted in turn assured at last that have intuitively arrived at correct conclusion about state of engagement with percy dear polly dear agnes said promised to hear out darling spoke in very soft tender voice turning round to laying hand on mine know what be going to say to harry if be painful will go away till have done harry must hear before can come to correct conclusion about money shook head silently pressed hand while went on still remained resting in mine lady desborough now be looking steadily into fire again a if read there be saying be proud woman of world very ambitious very self willed have percy followed wish remained in guard must have expected to have made first rate match a be must not hope that earl daughter must unite fortune to of cornet in cavalry regiment troop with out to india when percy therefore succeeded in persuading agnes here that be best thing must do lady desborough be delighted at match with agnes l be vastly better than must have expected when mr harmer dy what happens agnes have fortune time have be at school since mr harmer died will be missing have wondered thought over what lady desborough must do came to conclusion that must wait for bit must take decided step until be clear that will must never be found that unquestionably when be proved to be gone must interfere to break off engagement between percy agnes come back here what do find find very little said about engagement agnes looking pale depressed percy letter come regularly agnes take up into room come down again after very long time with flushed cheek soft look yet not perfectly happy be not brightly happy what doe mean just what have anticipated percy be unchanged money in eye make difference whatever there be obstacle somewhere that obstacle being of course lady desborough probably by continuance of correspondence have not yet given up hope of will being found have not

for to go up staircase by must not do thing for world must not indeed sir will reward handsomely sarah papa began ask dr ashleigh must not do if be to make rich woman life please sir ask girl be so evidently terrified at idea of going up secret staircase have already done so much for that felt must not be right to urge further looked at other for moment two in silence then polly said proper

ready on wednesday then have long chat over plan papa who have think strange tinge of romance in disposition quite looked forward to adventure polly talked over with great glee papa said that must write to mr petersfield tell that have found chamber ask to come down be present at finding of will so that must must box be too large for to carry give advice a to best course for to pursue on tuesday morning received answer to two letter that from sophy written in high spirit at discovery authorizing to act in name that from mr petersfield also written in term of warm congratulation saying that although legality of course be at least doubtful have felt so warm interest in search that must come down to be present at denouement felt quite sure that will when found must amply justify proceeding said that must leave town by afternoon train so nothing whatever seemed likely to occur to postpone expedition a must not help hoping in heart that something must do mr petersfield came down in evening be full of spirit at prospect of recovering will made several joke about female burglar amused polly very much made feel shivery uncomfortable at night after have gone up to bed polly came into room said agnes darling can see be nervous frightened about expedition of ours be not strong know think that really have better stay at home can just a well go by be only to see if be there when find if box must be too heavy for to carry sarah will not mind going up with second time to help to bring down polly answered know be coward be not so bad a will most certainly go with nothing must induce to stay at home let go alone still can not look at in same amusing way that do be to very awful business will see that when come to point will be able to go through calmly now good night dear will call at past five that night did not close eye thought over possible accident by might be detected at last made so nervous that must remain in bed no longer so got up lighted candle dressed then wrapped in warm shawl read till be time to call others then went woke polly who be sleeping a quietly peacefully a if be girl again at grendon house with nothing on mind extreme difficulty of german lesson woke up with cheerful laugh a remembered what be to be done afterwards knocked at papa mr petersfield door then lighted large spirit lamp under kettle papa have to make coffee when went out returned from night visit at five o'clock met in dining room looking a papa said like lot of conspirator quite agreed with however by time have taken cup of coffee bread butter slice of cold ham spirit quite rose again responded gaily to polly funny remark even felt more confident le nervous than have done since expedition have be proposed be just quarter past five when started still quite dark star be shining brightly keen march wind made shiver draw wrap more closely round a went out into carriage be waiting at door for old andrew to whom have confided somewhat of intended attempt be stamping up down swinging arm in attempt to warm papa have at first intended to walk afterwards came to conclusion that carriage passing through street at hour must excite attention at whereas if be seen walking must be sure to give rise to sort of surmise conjecture pulled down blind drove out through town when be fairly past barrack again pulled up looked out there be faint light growing up in east country round be a dark a ever met passed two three solitary individual going towards from town to work be silent party papa mr petersfield made occasional remark polly tried once twice to enliven must not do felt that be engaged upon serious business that future of life depended upon result a passed through sturry again pulled down blind for villager be astir there light smoke be curling up from chimney flickering fire light must be seen through latticed window many of men be starting to work drove up hill behind village then carriage turned up narrow lane where must be concealed from sight of one going along highroad here got out entered mr harmer ground by small gate followed footpath across park up to house then went round to front door now be once there felt longer frightened excitement of adventure set blood in glow what time be asked papa ten minute to six said dare say sarah be waiting for be for moment that reached door opened stepped out to meet be ready sir said to papa oiled lock bolt yesterday have everything undone ready so a to open door when heard footstep on gravel be not afraid now sir will go up with young lady if like sarah have better wait in hall to let know if hear one stirring in house will remain out here now girl courage victory now for polly said went into hall together there be three candlestick with lighted candle on table took one of with light step crossed hall to chimney place sarah at once knelt down unscrewed dog tongue touched spring then one in chimney door swung round with slight creak startling although expected while be doing looked round hall think that least trace of past fear remained be thinking of last time have be in hall little time before dear mother death how different be position then what change have sad nine month brought about thought too for moment of how might be next time entered with sophy a undisputed mistress quickly a thought have flitted across mind have only got thus far when creak of opening door made turn sharply round prepare for business on hand will go first agnes polly asked offering to pas answered be not in least afraid now be pulse beat quick be purely from excitement think at moment have miss harmer suddenly stepped down staircase before must have be afraid of holding candle well in front of stooped under low doorway began to ascend narrow stone stair polly following closely behind stair a papa have calculated be only five six in number then stood at once in chamber into for so many month have be so longing to penetrate now for will after first breathless look round low exclamation of disappointment broke from of there be box chest of kind to be seen room be mere cell little more than six foot high eight foot long six wide wall be of rough stone have be whitewashed at very distant time only furniture in be small table easy chair quite modern indeed chair be fellow to one remembered in mr harmer library on table stood inkstand pen paper there be torn scrap of paper on floor on picking up one of perceived word in mr harmer well known handwriting on table too be placed two three of scientific book half consumed cigar lay beside be evident from mr harmer have be in habit of using room for study warmth felt moment that came into from being against kitchen chimney suggested reason for so using be apparent that room have not be disturbed since left after reading there on perhaps very night before death there be other furniture place where will must be concealed examined wall closely without result only opening being small hole near roof about four inch square evidently leading into kitchen chimney for purpose of ventilation hiding place a far a must see there be none stair did not stop on reaching room wound upwards ascended very cautiously found that went up about ten step then ended at small door on be two bolt with one inside must fasten so prevent opening even if secret spring outside be discovered touched door have doubt formed entrance into mr harmer room opened by spring must not perceive indeed did look for returned with heavy heart to polly who have remained in chamber who be in vain examining wall for sign of hidden closet looked ruefully in others face be use polly said a cheerfully a must will not find will here be afraid not said gave silent kiss expressing sorrow for sake then taking candle went down stair into hall again sarah be standing listening with hushed breath have found miss sarah place be quite empty oh dear oh dear sarah exclaimed almost cry with vexation be so sorry put candle down on hall table went out into open air shook head in answer to look of papa mr petersfield asked question for saw at once by look that have found no sign of will present be time place for explanation so turned off from house walked fast across ground out to where carriage be standing for morning be fairly broken now figure must have be seen for considerable distance once in carriage related that have seen that there be sign of will to be found mr petersfield papa be very much disappointed mr petersfield remarked that most likely have be within arm reach of will for be certain now that mr harmer did use room for study that doubt there be secret hiding place there made originally for concealment of important paper in case entrance to secret chamber must be discovered be singular fancy of mr harmer to use little place for writing in can quite understand papa said mr harmer lived long time in india where night early morning be pleasantest part of twenty four hour have heard say that often rose at four o'clock got through five hour writing before breakfast can remember now once said to that must find very cold in winter said 'oh have very snug little place for ' did not ask where be although dare say have done so must have told be evident now that be in chamber from warmth from so immediately adjoining room must be very convenient for a must not be under fear of disturbing house by movement have doubt be correct in conjecture that there be secret receptacle there for paper must never be discovered without secret being communicated at rate must give up now said have not least idea that will ever hear more of others be silent for too felt that be in vain now to cherish further hope of discovery chapter vii course of true love reached home after expedition little before seven o'clock then sat down to regular breakfast under influence of spirit rose somewhat recovered little from disappointment polly agreed that be settled that be not to be heiress that be use repining talked good deal of sophy agreed that loss be matter of far more serious importance to than be to feared have terrible life before wondered what husband must do for time while be talking mr petersfield ate breakfast in silence be evidently not attending to what be saying be lost in own contemplation what be thinking of papa asked at last be thinking doctor be be wondering how herbert harmer came to know of secret hiding place of course sister may have told of must doubt if did be wondering if found described in old family document if so where be now there be no longer paper in possession a at miss harmer request gave up week after funeral to new solicitor must think said that mr harmer be shown secret hiding place at time when first knew of chamber be when went into a boy with father doubt papa said doubt be say more about petersfield let make up mind to inevitable have done best now let give up there be not believe slightest chance in world of ever hearing more about be far better to give up than to go on hoping against hope keeping in fever about what will never take place let give matter up altogether turn over fresh page of life be worse off than other people let look forward a if have never be give up past altogether so be settled will henceforth ceased to be subject of conversation among after breakfast mr petersfield took leave returned to london when papa have gone out on round of visit sister polly have sat down for usual hour practice on piano went up into own room shut locked door prepared for task have before for be clear to that must now face position must no longer play at ship with knew that last hope have fled last anchor to have so fondly trusted be gone now bark of happiness be destined to certain irretrievable wreck knew that engagement with percy must come to end that letter must write must be mean of making do so how long sat there on dreary march morning know with paper lying open untouched before black edge fitting symbol of dead hope whose tale have to write upon not that think looked at eye be fixed blankly on wall before not one word did write although time hand held pen ready to set down what heart brain must dictate nothing came heart seemed cold dead a if must feel motion while brain be in strange whirl of thought yet thought framed into tangible shape hardly know what current took past future can not recall one single thought indeed question if one stood out prominently enough among others to have be seized even at time how long sat there know at last be recalled to myself by loud continued knocking at door think heard time before answered did not seem to to be connected at with to be noise long way off even when be sure that be at door that be loud urgent knocking be little time before must rouse sufficiently to answer at last said what be knocking be so loud that voice be not heard now distinguished polly voice calling to tried to rise found that limb be stiff numbed however with great effort for be really frightened at noise got up with great difficulty moved to door opened be about to repeat question what be when polly burst in pale terror stricken tear rolling fast down cheek fell upon neck sobbed out oh agnes agnes how have frightened frightened said how what be matter what have be doing why did not answer knocking answered directly heard then what have be doing agnes have be knocking for ten minute how pale be hand be a cold a ice so be face be nearly frozen there say anything now come down to dining room have difficulty in getting downstairs have sat so long motionless in cold be a polly said nearly frozen required assistance must give before be able to get down at once in dining room polly wheeled sofa up in front of fire then ran off got boiling water from kitchen made glass of hot port wine water insisted on drinking scalding hot time scolding petting then when began to get warm again told that when have done practising not finding anywhere asked housemaid if have seen girl told have gone into room more than hour before that have not seen since polly went back to dining room finding that time went on did not come down came up to room to scold for staying up in cold so long to suggest that if have not finished writing must go into papa consulting room where must be quite secure from interruption have knocked receiving answer have at first gone away again thinking that perhaps have lain down gone to sleep having have such short night after have gone down stair again came to conclusion must not have done without telling of intention so have come up to door again finding that first gentle knocking have produced effect have continued getting louder louder becoming more more terrified until at last just a have opened door have worked into agony of terror that be on point of running down into kitchen to send out for one to come in to force door told polly be very sorry that have frightened so much that really did not know what have come over have sat there thinking that supposed have got regularly numbed have not noticed knocking until got up opened door when be thoroughly warmed again proposed going into library to write letter polly must not let a said that have have more than enough excitement for one day so yielded to entreaty not sorry indeed to put off painful task if only for one day on following morning however went into papa study to write letter got through more easily than have expected polly came in from time to time to see be not agitating too much only staying just for minute two to kiss say little word of consolation love first letter be to percy told what have happened that hope might previously have entertained of finding will be now entirely extinguished told that knew loved for own sake unworthy doubt that must make difference in have ever entered mind frankly said that feared lady desborough must no longer give approval consent that foresaw painful time

to do so at one time resolved upon former wrote beginning of two three letter to effect then said to myself why must do why must assume that must stop allowance of l year percy have when think that with staff pay expects to get in india there be reason why must not manage very well accordingly came to conclusion to write to ada told that have done that will be now unquestionably lost for ever said that be of course grievous disappointment to then after little chit chat upon ordinary matter wound up by asking to show to lady desborough part relating to loss of will although wrote letter at same time did not send off one to ada until following day delayed in way in order that lady desborough might get letter from percy within few hour of receiving mine so that might not answer until have heard percy argument entreaty that must not withdraw approval of engagement second letter sent off have nothing to do to wait patiently oh how anxiously for result percy letter came by return of post be just what knew must be repetition of one have written when will be first found missing full of passionate protestation of love assurance that fortune have only value in eye on account therefore to

other horse mounted started for canterbury chapter xii after battle how well remember that morning excitement into be thrown by terrible news burglary at harmer place reported murder of younger miss harmer yet with excitement people be hardly surprised harmer place have got evil name now folk shook head spoke almost low when mentioned for last twenty five year curse seemed to hang over belonging two elder brother drowned intention plan set aside property devolving to very person be so determined to disinherit gerald harmer killed melancholy circumstance attending death herbert harmer adopted child elopement own sudden death intention frustrated a brother have be before by will being missing be indeed long list of misfortune up to time have seemed almost a if providence have decreed that must prove fatal inheritance to protestant who have contrary to will of dead brother taken possession of old roman catholic property wrested from clutch of mother church have brought happiness son death have destroyed hope plan for future that son daughter whom have reared with so much kindness care have fled away from home at night news have dealt deathblow then missing will really seemed a if be fated that romish church must have own again elder brother intention be carried out general community have wondered over chain of event told tale to stranger a extraordinary example of series of unexpected event have frustrated best laid plan baffled human calculation while few catholic of town instanced a manifest interposition of providence on behalf of church now table seemed turned curse of harmer place a began to be called appeared working anew against catholic possessor news came to while be at breakfast be inexpressibly shocked papa at once ordered carriage directly came to door started for harmer place to inquire a to truth of dreadful report returned in about hour half brought quite budget of news to when arrived have sent up name miss harmer sent down word that doctor sadman wilkinson be in attendance that therefore must not trouble to come in papa have felt good deal hurt at message thought be probably given because miss harmer knowing how much have injured be afraid that sister might recognize in state be in reveal something about will however just a carriage be driving away dr sadman who from window above have seen papa drive up came to door called after papa stopped carriage got out went back to speak to dr sadman particularly wished to come up to give benefit of opinion finding that miss harmer be not in room that angela be insensible not likely ever to recover consciousness have gone up with have found in dying state did not think at likely that must live more than few hour be apparently dying from effect of shock upon system terror pain that have undergone for round one arm piece of string be found have cut completely into flesh probably for purpose of extorting supposed place of concealment of plate valuable money have not apparently received injury in must have be sufficient to cause death have have very heavy fall upon back of head might have affected brain symptom however from be suffering be not exactly must have be caused by concussion of brain although fall have assisted to produce evil yet on whole death must be attributable rather to mental shock terror distress than to actual bodily violence papa have heard particular of night event a far a miss harmer have told other medical men have received very heavy blow from blunt instrument short stick end of pistol have left very severe wound on forehead from be suffering so much that much a wished be quite unable to sit up take place by sister side be in bed still although much shaken there be nothing serious to be apprehended miss harmer have fired pistol at one of assailant be believed that have wounded a few spot of blood be visible on floor on staircase have recognized none of figure of whom there be three be believed masked whether be tall short indeed about particular of be quite ignorant for have seen only sister surrounded by have rushed forward fired almost unconsciously be felled to ground instant afterwards first seeing angela chair thrown backwards with in blow have received in fall laceration of arm by string be only sign of violence must be found on angela person police be up there have at present discovered clue to guide in search one of men on duty in town remembered that about three o'clock light cart with two men in have driven in on road have seen cart go out through westgate there be at present nothing to connect with affair detective have be telegraphed for at miss harmer request be expected down in afternoon papa told in very grave serious way be very much shocked indeed for time after have done be silent then polly said be anything stolen papa asked question so earnestly that looked up almost in surprise with miss harmer dying seemed such very indifferent matter whether robber have stolen anything not that appeared to extraordinary question for polly to ask so anxiously papa did not seem to think so for answered a seriously a have spoken only watch chain diamond cross from dressing table be attempt made to break open plate closet place below dear papa said none at be silent again looked surprised from one to other what must question of few thing matter when woman have known so long be dying yet polly papa evidently thought did that mattered very much too for looked very meaningly at other understand said be laying so much stress upon what can be of consequence to people of wealth by look seem to think really matter of consequence polly papa be still silent what be papa said wearily be stronger now think must take great deal to affect much nothing must be told here certainly please tell what mean for although really see how robbery at miss harmer can be more serious than seems for be bad enough still worry thinking about idea dear agnes papa said very gravely have struck have be thinking over ever since left harmer place see have also occurred to polly be that be robbery at be robbery be part of original scheme be very much afraid that be effort on part of robert gregory to get possession of will have said that must not be shocked be terribly more than have believed must be by anything not connected with percy why papa asked presently what make think dreadful thing whole proceeding of men dear so different from what might be expected of ordinary burglar on entering house must have proceeded at once to pantry plate room forced door stripped of content must have done in most noiseless manner possible to avoid disturbing one in house men on contrary never seem to have gone near place at rate there be sign of having attempted to force appear to have gone straight to bedroom of younger weaker of sister to have seized gagged cruelly tortured to make reveal hiding place of what surely not of plate might with little search have found that for not of money jewellery there be hardly likely to have be much in house assuredly nothing angela harmer must not at once have given up rather than endure pain must have suffered what then must have wanted to mind unquestionably will a one harry be interested in discovery with exception of robert gregory fear there be doubt of being author of scheme indeed that be personally engaged in be time before continued conversation be sick faint at news idea of sophy whom have known liked so well being wife of man who have committed burglary if not murder be too shocking be time before recovered polly spoke next only thing papa be why must angela harmer who so nearly revealed where will be to so obstinately refuse to do so even under such terrible pain terror dear when saw acted upon feeling of compassion for agnes here for time shook rooted faith that be acting rightly in case there be nothing to act upon conviction felt doubt while refusing to betray where will be hidden that be suffering a martyr for good of church with martyr strength firmness underwent what be inflicted upon have doubt that idea will occur to miss harmer a have done to in case there be little doubt that robert gregory will be speedily arrested for a hear be well known betting man in police will be pretty certain to find last evil arising from be that miss harmer will undoubtedly in case destroy will now dear take glass of wine then lie down upon sofa till dinnertime get to sleep if can worry about a to will have already given up hope of ever finding so that will make difference now whether be destroyed not polly see that agnes doe a order must run risk of being laid up again at about half past eleven papa be told that man wished to speak to tanner of rochester be shown in be speaking to dr ashleigh papa bowed be not come to consult about sir about one else be of use describing symptom to doctor said can not prescribe unless see patient wish to do so sir be very peculiar business hardly know how to begin person who sent told that might be implicitly trusted hope so sir dr ashleigh said haughtily a be not fond of secret mystery must rather went to other medical man good morning man made motion to go offence be intended doctor when safety of three four men including perhaps be concerned one can not be too careful at rate will give message if after that come why will have have ride of nigh thirty mile here a much back for nothing word of message be beophy husband robert be dying begs to go see ' papa have listened to first part of man speech with evident impatience when message came face changed altogether good heaven exclaimed then suspicion be correct unfortunate man be dying of pistol wound be not something like man answered will come sir come of course will must go to man to whom aid must be useful to be matter of consequence whether be good bad one in case will for sophy sake do what can for husband bad a be afraid be doctor shrunk back from man what have to do with nothing be glad to say man answered till got into town did not know where what job be from what one be talking about at place where put up horse be afraid do know now shocking bad affair seems although if what hear of be true ca make head tail of what be up to two of men be at least too old hand to have gone on in way did there be something beyond what one see be right dr ashleigh said never went for plunder at can guess very well what did go for be of consequence now how then be concerned in affair came to hired horse cart asked question perhaps have own thought what be up to be business of mine well sir morning came back with dying man in cart have nothing for to take in where be hurt doctor asked right in side just above hip be afraid be up with long journey loss of blood have pretty well

up horse see there be train for london at one o'clock get there about four then must go down by rochester train get there between six seven very thing papa said for be very probable that suspicion will fall upon man a be known to be in certain sort of way likely to go to in case be hurt must be sure to attract notice might lead to being traced be to take carriage over a far a rochester be afraid by what say that will be of use will bring instrument with practised a surgeon for year a young man how will find place will meet at station sir will give horse two hour rest will then get over there easily by six o'clock after brief consultation of time table to see exact hour at first train from london papa must catch must reach rochester tanner took leave papa packed up such thing a must

steadily a answered be very glad to see again sophy came up specially to do so did not know till came to door that be confined be even expecting be very glad for sake that be so that have got over so well dr ashleigh spoke very kindly sophy at once detected certain gravity in manner be anything matter asked at once dr ashleigh hardly knew what answer to make hesitated for moment whether must not be better to defer communication of fatal intelligence for few day thought of anxiety sophy must suffer from robert continued unexplained silence decided for thought must probably pine fret so much that in short time must be in state even le fitted to stand blow than be at present dear sophy said sitting down upon bed taking hand in since last saw thing have greatly changed with with need not say how much with also greatly be so sorry sophy began a if about to lament share have have in dear sophy blame be over long ago must at rate have possibly foreseen that child must have be injured by anything might have done to displease mr harmer humanly speaking contrary effect might have be anticipated only say that great change have taken place little friend polly have grown into very dear lovable clever woman while agnes have suffered very much engagement with mr desborough have be broken off have be very ill however by god mercy have be spared to be still in sadly weak state there be something else doctor be there not new misfortune can not be about robert said anxiously must not have heard anything of dr ashleigh be silent be then oh tell what be dear sophy have judged rightly do come to tell about robert must be calm collected remember that excitement on part now must be most injurious to child remember that illness on part mean death on sophy with great effort controlled sat very quiet colour have faded from cheek now mark of care seemed to come back again very plain deep then after waiting minute two until felt quite quiet laid one hand on cheek of sleeping baby looked up appealingly into dr ashleigh face dear sophy husband have met with accident be seriously injured sophy cheek be a white now a dress wore spoke not although lip be parted eye at time large now looking unnaturally so from thinness of cheek begged for more news be afraid be very ill doctor said must go to panted out must go to made effort to rise can not dr ashleigh said can not must kill bear bravely sophy keep quiet child for own sake baby again sophy hand went back to infant face from in effort to rise have for moment withdrawn rested on soft unconscious cheek never took eye from doctor face at last said in strange far off sort of voice tell worst be dead read answer in face gave low short cry then be silent eye no longer looked at gazed with blank horror into distance a if sought to penetrate obstacle to seek dead husband comfort poor child dr ashleigh said tenderly god have stricken grievously have given child to love sophy made answer heard saw sat rigid stiff picture of mute despair two three time doctor spoke to nothing betokened that heard raised hand be laying motionless in let go fell lifelessly on bed again began to be seriously alarmed feared that must awaken from state with succession of wild shriek then series of fainting fit termination of in condition must probably be death in hope of acting upon newborn feeling of maternity took child up placed against arm made movement to enclose support showed sign of consciousness of what be doing then slightly pinched child arm woke with loud wailing cry in instant change passed over rigid face human light came into stony fixed eye with little cry quick convulsive movement clasped child to breast leaned over tear rained down freely now a swayed to fro hushed to bosom dr ashleigh knew that worst be over now for time let grief have way undisturbed then persuaded to lie down enfeebled a be by recent illness in le than hour cried to sleep doctor sat by side until awoke be not for time when did so be calmer more composed then talked to very soothingly did not enter into of detail of husband death beyond fact that be result of accident that have died at rochester must be buried there that have sent for that have be with to end that name have be last word on lip doctor told must return again in few day to see that must not disquiet about future for that must take care of child a if be own sophy answered dreamily although gratefully to said be at present too much stunned by blow to be capable of fixing attention indeed scarce understood word while sophy be asleep dr ashleigh have gone out told news to mr billow be deeply concerned at although regret be evidently more for sophy sake than for of husband readily promised to do in power to soothe comfort sophy said be sure that a soon a felt equal to one other of kind neighbour must be glad to come over sit with promised must sophy be taken worse must immediately telegraph for dr ashleigh doctor stayed till late in afternoon then drove round to sophy medical attendant to tell that have just received news of husband death to bespeak best care attention on behalf afterwards returned to station reached home at nine o'clock be very pleased to see back again for be not often that be away so long a thirty hour however did not ask question did not volunteer a usually did account of doings so have idea that have be to more than ordinary visit demanding unusual time attention a have before said be month afterwards before be told of robert gregory death be fortunate a turned out that papa got back that evening for while be at breakfast next morning servant brought over letter from miss harmer be written on previous evening said that a have declined to see on day before when have called might feel difficulty in coming now to see that have particular matter on be very anxious to speak to have forgotten to say that when papa came home evening before have news to give indeed have quite expected to hear that angela harmer have died previous evening papa have strong suspicion what be that miss harmer wished to see about while horse be being put into carriage have little consultation with polly in study agreed that for sophy sake must try to lull a far a possible suspicion miss harmer might entertain of robert having have part in affair besides be quite certain that unless suspicion might have be laid at rest must at last destroy will although be very secondary matter now a there did not seem most remote probability of ever coming to light even if must be in existence for year papa then started for harmer place on arriving be shown at once into drawing room order evidently having be given to effect in few minute miss harmer joined forehead be bandaged up general aspect be more stiff forbidding than ever after first few remark be over proceeded at once to point must be strange step to have taken dr ashleigh in position in stand to other for to have asked to have come over here have not have very powerful reason for so doing appears to have for have very strong suspicion concerning event have taken place here in last two day have heard particular yes miss harmer when called here day before yesterday dr sadman gave detail of so far a knew did hear that burglar miss harmer strongly emphasized word did not attempt to take anything downstairs doctor bowed assent did hear that tortured sister to make tell something did miss harmer have before heard of people being threatened even absolutely tortured to oblige to tell where valuable be concealed be very rare occurrence surprised at time almost a much a shocked a general thing burglar when attempt robbery ascertain previously where valuable be kept act accordingly be possible that in case be not so men may have be merely passing vagrant may have be thief from london who may have heard that there be very fine collection of plate here taking into consideration lonely position of place fact that only male in be servant who sleep in remote corner of house may have thought that must be at once quicker must save trouble of breaking open number of door in search for plate closet to come at once to owner whom imagined must readily be frightened into revealing exact whereabouts supposition dr ashleigh be nearly of detective who have be sent down here who knowing nothing of private affair must not without clue come to other conclusion say be strange unusual although not unprecedented affair clue have not yet given although intend to do so upon leaving room a have not least doubt in own mind that suspicion be correct sister dr ashleigh be not tortured to tell where plate be hidden be treated a be to make divulge supposed hiding place of what in spite of can say still appears that of persist in believing to be in existence mean late brother will dr ashleigh made movement of astonishment yes dr ashleigh have doubt that be so need not say that for moment suspect yours of having slightest knowledge complicity in villainous plot to poor sister have fallen victim there be who be interested in supposed will who to murder of brother have now added murder of poor sister mean robert gregory thank god law can will avenge murder if must not other miss harmer papa said very quietly have have much to agitate trouble be not therefore surprised at thus fixing upon indeed in way put doe seem reasonable believe that will regret hastiness when tell that be actually accusing dead man dead robert gregory dead miss harmer exclaimed greatly astonished have idea of how long have be dead only short time dr ashleigh answered be not surprised that be ignorant of fact for be hardly likely that sophy must have written to tell poor young widow be only confined last week have to go to town on business after left here day before yesterday called to see child have be keeping until be confined by giving lesson in music did know of husband death before saw then miss harmer asked most assuredly did doctor answered heard of at time when died now miss harmer trust have quite dissipated suspicion robert gregory be dead wife be on sick bed child acknowledge be very unlikely to have entered into plot of sort quite dr ashleigh in fact can not be otherwise be exceedingly glad that spoke to before putting matter into hand of detective for must have perhaps put off right clue must have led to discussion of very painful matter about sophy here hesitated be in very bad circumstance because even looking at in way do always will do a brother murderess must not like to need not be uneasy on score miss harmer papa said rather coldly have already told sophy that house be home for child whenever may choose to come whether will use a such can not say think can assert with certainty that must rather lay head in street than owe shelter to favour be there anything else wish to ask about in can be of service to nothing dr ashleigh really feel much obliged to for having set mind at rest upon point have be troubling much for last three day indeed by information that bad man have gone to end have set greatly at ease on own account for believing a did that be perpetrator of dreadful deed must have never felt safe until have met with desert at hand of law that such murderous attack might not have be perpetrated upon be believe coward still with idea that be life in question must have offered reward for apprehension must have set policeman in england on look out for be glad to hear that daughter agnes be better goodbye dr ashleigh be sorry that can not be friend at least need not be enemy held out hand to dr ashleigh took then retired well pleased that have without actual sacrifice of truth be enabled to save sophy perhaps day sophy child from pain shame of exposure must have followed have not miss harmer suspicion be averted on following week papa again went up to london to see sophy found recovering from blow still pale thin upon whole a well a must have be expected papa again offered home with declined gratefully decidedly have said even when be supposed that be heiress be looked down upon on account of misfortune of birth now with story of elopement mr harmer sudden death fresh on memory must rather beg bread in street than live there must accept money for present us again thanked papa declined have said plenty of money have be putting by nearly four pound week for ten month be therefore provided for for long time that must promise at last be that if must ever be really in distress for money must not hesitate to write apply to for when point have be discussed at length sophy insisted upon knowing particular of robert death papa after in vain endeavouring to persuade to be content with what knew already be obliged at last to tell softening worst point a much a must saying only that robert have gone at night with two men in hope of frightening angela harmer into disclosing where will be hidden how have be disturbed by miss harmer who have fired pistol have wounded robert how have be carried to rochester to die told too for feared might see in paper angela harmer have died same evening from fright suppressed mention of cruelty violence partly told how miss harmer have entertained suspicion of truth how have believed succeeded in laying at rest that felt sure that subject must not be pursued further in direction still for sake child must one under pretence other come make inquiry a to date of robert death that must mention that took place short time earlier than really did sophy heard doctor through more tranquilly than have expected asked few question here there be very pale composed when have quite done said surprise dr ashleigh husband have so frequently asked question about position of different room have so often said that must try for day that when came told that be killed by accident did not say how when where guessed that be somehow in trying to get will if please will not say more about now want to think over head ache sadly be much obliged to for kindness so sophy held out hand papa came away still very uneasy about repeating former direction to mr billow to send for at once in event of sophy being taken ill week after letter came from sophy to began by again thanking papa for kindness to saying that be determined if possible to earn living for herself child must however from illness other cause fail in attempt must then for child sake accept kindness letter went on child will be one chief object of life have in success of will be interested be determined next to child to devote life to finding stolen will have tried failed robert tried laid down life in attempt alone by whose conduct will be lost have not tried will do so will be purpose of life thought energy will be given to for sake of child of who have innocently be punished for fault be not going to act now know must be useless day may be year on day will try when do will succeed seek to dissuade from determination be irrevocable did write tried to argue with answered briefly that nothing must alter resolve from time to time exchanged letter at longer interval until at last did not answer one of mine from time year past before again heard of sophy gregory end of vol ii
