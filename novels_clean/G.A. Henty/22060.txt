barclay spoke so gravely that ralph asked anxiously think will thrash papa consider very doubtful ralph father said prussia have already gained immense moral victory have chosen own time for war have at same time obliged france to take initiative so to appear to be aggressor therefore to lose moral support of europe have forced quarrel upon france yet nine tenth of europe look upon france a inciter of war history will show truth will then be too late a be france enters upon war with weight of public opinion dead against what be worse enters upon altogether unprepared whereas prussia have be getting ready for year french always have shown to be better soldier than prussian papa so have percy equally well led disciplined organized believe that in anything like equal force must do so again question be have general to equal who led prussian to victory against austria be discipline equal anything like equal to of prussian be organization a good a theirs lastly have anything like number like look of boy at ought according to published account to be able to put larger army than theirs in field just at first if be prepared must certainly be able to carry before for while question very much if be so prepared supposing to be so however success must fear be temporary for german reserve be greatly superior to ours discipline too have gone off sadly since first knew french army radical opinion may be very wise very excellent for nation for aught know be certain that be fatal to discipline of army own opinion a know be that be equally fatal for country be matter of opinion only of fact that good radical make extremely bad soldier be quite clear spread of radical opinion among french army have be very great then too officer have be much to blame think of pleasure far more than duty spend four time a much time in cafe billiard room a do in drill ground altogether in opinion french army have greatly gone off in point except in courage being matter of nationality be probably a high a ever be bad lookout boy very bad lookout there talk about more want to make mother unhappy remember not to express either a own opinion anything have said in town must only render

frenchwoman must not grudge love most to fight for france ah melanie captain barclay said smiling little patriotic outburst be delightful when one doe not have to practice at one own expense 'it be sweet right to die for one country ' said old roman everyone agrees with at same time individual man have strong objection to put in way of sweet proper death although a say frenchwoman must grudge love to country fancy if levee en masse took place tomorrow boy a well a cripple have to go so that ralph percy be obliged to march must feel that did grudge to country most amazingly mr barclay turned little pale at suggestion ah ca suppose richard be english can not touch boy even if must march if be old enough captain barclay smiled be answer melanie be shirking question said if be to make go ah yes be afraid must grudge richard boy except enemy be to invade france then everyone even woman must fight of there be chance be who will invade captain barclay made reply plum want gathering papa percy said returning from cutting lettuce be arranged that cousin must come over when be ripe have regular picking have plum madame duburg want for preserving may go over after dinner ask to come in at three o'clock spend evening certainly captain barclay said can give mamma compliment ask if uncle madame duburg will come in after have dined young one will make dinner at six o'clock tea in france early dinner be thing scarcely known even among peasantry be to say meal be taken at somewhat same time a ours be be called by different name frenchman never eats what call breakfast be never make really heavy meal first thing in morning take however coffee milk bread butter when get up doe not call breakfast speaks of a morning coffee take breakfast at eleven half past eleven even at twelve be regular meal with soup meat wine in england must be called early lunch at six o'clock frenchman dines even working man call meal english laborer must call supper dinner barclays meal therefore differed more in name than in reality from of neighbor louis philippe duburg came in at five o'clock brought message sister must come in with father mother later melanie be surprised disappointed at non arrival of cousin greatly preferred being with boy always felt uncomfortable with julie justine who although little older than be already a prim decorous properly behaved a if have be woman of thirty year old after tea be over four boy returned to work of gathering plum while melanie milly a father called to distinguish from mother picked up plum fell handed up fresh basket received full one laughed chattered with brother cousin while so engaged monsieur madame duburg arrived with daughter julie justine monsieur duburg mr barclay brother be proprietor of considerable estate planted almost entirely with vine income be large one for soil be favorable carried on culture with such care attention that wine fetched higher price than in district be clear headed sensible man with keen eye to bargain be fond of sister english husband have offered opposition to boy entering into game amusement of cousin although wife be constantly urging to do so be to madame duburg terrible thing that boy instead of being always tidy orderly ready when at home to accompany for walk must come home flushed hot untidy with perhaps swelled cheek black eye from effect of blow from cricket ball boxing glove upon arrival at captain barclay two gentleman strolled out to smoke cigar together to discus prospect of war effect upon price mr barclay have asked julie justine if must like to go down to orchard madame duburg have so hurriedly answered in name in negative saying that must stroll round garden until melanie returned that mr barclay have resource to ask when passed near orchard to call milly in name to join in garden dear melanie madame duburg began when daughter have walked away in quiet prim manner hand in hand be really quite shocked a came along there be melanie laughing calling out a loudly a boy handing up basket lifting others down with hair in confusion looking excuse saying so more like peasant girl than young lady mr barclay smiled quietly milly be enjoying doubt sister in law see that laughing calling out handing basket will do serious harm a for hair five minute brushing will set that right dear sister in law madame duburg said earnestly do recall to yourself milly be nearly fourteen year old that will soon be becoming woman that in three year will be searching for husband for faith be terrible have yet figure manner madame duburg looked with air of gratified pride at stiff figure of own two girl figure be not bad one sister in law mr barclay said composedly be taller than julie who be six month senior be a straight a arrow health be admirable have never have day illness can not walk absolutely can not walk madame duburg said lifting up hand in horror walked upwards of twelve mile with father yesterday mr barclay said pretending to misunderstand sister in law meaning did not mean that madame duburg said impatiently walk like peasant girl faith be shocking to say walk like boy must be desolated to see daughter step out in way then look at manner word have manner at other day when be here monsieur de riviere with son called be awkward shy yes indeed be positively awkward shy be dreadful for to have to say so sister in law be true manner ease julie even justine can receive visitor even a must do manner be not formed yet sister in law mr barclay said quietly do care that must be be young girl at present wish to see woman before time in three year will be time enough for to mend manner in three year sister in law will be looking for husband for will be doing nothing of sort mr barclay said steadily in a in many other matter greatly prefer english way a know give up house in two year go to england to reside have economized greatly during seventeen year since marriage can afford to live in england now at sixteen therefore milly will have good master for two year education will be carried on walk manner will doubt improve in england father mother arrange marriage of child milly will have to do a other girl do be wait until someone fall in love with fall in love with then if be proper person have enough to keep will be married madame duburg be too much shocked at expression of sentiment to answer at once only sighed shook head looked upwards be strange said at last to hear sister in law frenchwoman speak so lightly of marriage a if young girl must know a well a parent who be fit proper person for to marry besides idea of young girl falling in love before marries be shocking quite shocking dear sister in law mr barclay said have talked matter over before have always stated opinion frankly have be good deal in england have seen therefore know result of english marriage know also what french marriage be one who doe know state of thing in two country can hesitate for moment in declaring that married life in england be infinitely happier in respect than be in france idea of telling daughter that be to marry man whom have never seen a do in france be to mind simply monstrous fortunately married for love have be happy ever since intend milly when time come to do same thing before madame duburg have time to answer gentleman joined conversation turned upon war in short time three girl came up what rosy little thing be milly uncle said where do get plump cheek bright color wish must give receipt to julie justine why if be to blow very hard do think must blow down be really surprised at monsieur duburg wife said angrily be sure wish julie justine to have a much color a cousin consider quite misfortune for poor milly be so very commonplace poor child look a if have be working at vintage be right madame stand up for own husband who be accustomed to wife speech laughed for commonplace not commonplace must like to see of milly bright healthy color in girl cheek must like to see walk a if have forgotten for moment tight boot high heel wife be about to make angry reply when arrival of four boy bearing in triumph last basket of plum changed conversation shortly afterwards madame duburg remarking that evening be damp that did not like julie justine to be out in later du burg took leave chapter terrible news ten day succeeding declaration of war be day of excitement anticipation troop quartered at dijon moved forward at once scarcely hour passed long train filled with soldier from lyon south be on way up towards metz people of dijon spent time in around station platform be kept clear band of lady relieved other few hour handed soup bread fruit wine to soldier a passed through crowded train be greeted a approached station with cheer waving of handkerchief to troop a heartily responded most of train be decorated with bough presented gay appearance a filled with little line men sunburned zouaves swarthy turcos gay hussar sober artilleryman wound slowly into town of train be le gay be not le significant of war long line of wagon filled with cannon open truck with deadly shell arranged side by side point upwards looking more like egg in basket than deadly missile came went there too be long train of pontoon for forming bridge while half hour long line of wagon filled with biscuit barrel of wine sack of coffee case of store of sort kind passed through enthusiasm of dijon at sight of moving panorama of war rose to fever sound of marseillaise resounded from morning to night victory be looked upon a certain only subject of debate be a to term victorious france must impose upon conquered prussia only impatience felt be for news of first victory captain barclay sent down several cask of wine for use of passing troop wife went down day to assist at distribution in evening milly scraped old rag to make lint for wounded lycee be still closed a be found impossible to get boy to attend to study ralph percy spent time in watching train go past in shouting hoarse captain barclay did not share in general enthusiasm morning at breakfast looked more more grave a upon opening paper found there be still news of commencement of hostility what difference doe make papa ralph asked one day be sending fresh troop up hour see how few day delay can be disadvantage to make difference ralph difference in world have considerably larger standing army than prussian have advantage that main body of troop be very much nearer to frontier than of prussian if thing have be ready ought to have marched two hundred thousand men into germany three four day at latest after declaration of war german must have have force capable of resisting must have have prestige of first success no slight thing with french army must also have have great solid advantage of fighting in enemy country instead of upon own german reserve be far greater than own know how perfect organization be hour of delay be immense advantage to be quite likely now that instead of french invading germany will be prussian who will invade france boy be little affected by father foreboding be scarcely possible to suppose that everyone must be wrong still more impossible to believe that great host saw passing so full of high hope eager courage must be beaten be however very glad to sit round table of evening while captain barclay opened great map on table explained strength of various position probability of line of attack being selected by one other army day after day went by until on nd of august news came at last first blow have be struck first blood shed french have taken saarbruck be too late captain barclay said a ralph percy rushed in to say that news be posted up at prefecture be too late boy english paper of morning have brought news that german be massing at least seven eight hundred thousand men along line from saar louis to spiers be evident that fell back from saarbruck without serious resistance in two three day will be in readiness a must far outnumber men will see that advantage at saarbruck will not be followed up that prussian will assume offensive then what do really think will be result papa think ralph that will be forced to do what not having at once taken offensive ought to have done from first will have to fall back to abandon line of frontier be altogether indefensible to hold line of moselle spur of vosges immensely strong position ought to be able to hold against effort of prussia exultation of dijon be short lived for on th boy came up in afternoon from town with very serious face what be matter ralph there be rumor in town papa that swiss paper have published account of capture of weissenburg by prussian great many french be said to be prisoner do think can be true be probable at rate ralph swiss paper must of course get news hour so after be known in germany must not begin by believing that telegram say because side be certain to claim victory still absolute capture of town be matter upon there can be dispute be therefore likely enough to be true know prussian be massed all along line a expected have taken offensive chance of success in so doing be evident a party know where others be preparing to strike blow can therefore concentrate strike with overwhelming force at given point now that german have made first move shown intention party will concentrate in direction see from weissenburg german can either march south upon strasburg southwest upon metz nancy to reach latter place will have to cross spur of vosges french will of course try to bar further advance may expect great battle in day two news came too soon for two day later dijon a well a france stood aghast at news of utter rout of macmahon division after desperately contested battle of woerth not le decided though le disastrous defeat of french left at forbach by troop of steinmetz little consolation be however gleaned by fact that french have be beaten in detail have shown utmost gallantry against greatly superior number must now doubt fall back behind moselle hold line position of vosges until fresh troop must come up great battle be fought upon more even term fresh levy be everywhere ordered deep general feeling of rage prevailed one thought of blaming troop be evident that have done best fault lay with general with organization captain barclay pointed out to boy that officer men be somewhat to blame also for utter confusion prevailed among macmahon troop in retreat showed that whole regimental system be faulty that there must have be real discipline shattered regiment must have rallied few mile from field of battle in dijon change during last fortnight be marvelous war spirit be higher than ever cost what might disgrace must be wiped out mobile be hard at work drilling soldier who have long left army be starting by train to depot sound of marseillaise rang through street night day chorus to arm gained fresh meaning power in spite of first defeat none dreamed of final defeat day however news became worse strasburg be cut off prussian marched unopposed across spur of vosges where mere handful of men might have checked boy there be terrible day in store for france captain barclay said when news came that enemy have entered nancy line of moselle be turned bazaine will be cut off unless hurry retreat then nothing can stop prussian from marching to paris boy sat speechless at terrible assurance surely can not be a bad a mr barclay said frenchman can not have lost old quality france will rise like one man to march to defense of paris raw levy will be of use against prussian troop flushed with victory captain barclay said even if be armed where be arm for levy en masse to come from if bazaine be beaten only hope of france be for troop who remain to fall back under gun of fort of paris for france to enter upon immense guerrilla war for host of skirmisher to hang upon flank rear cutting road destroying bridge checking movement of detached body so actually starving out on ground occupy however will demand immense amount of pluck of endurance of perseverance of sacrifice of patriotism question be doe france posse quality surely richard can not doubt patriotism of french mr barclay said little reproachfully dear melanie husband said be sorry to say very greatly doubt patriotism of french be more than people more even than english whom laugh at a nation of shopkeeper money making race bourgeoise class shopkeeper small proprietor be selfish in extreme think only of money business comfort lower class be perhaps better first thought will be how war will affect unless there be chance of enemy approaching home driving off cattle plundering cottage will look on with very calm eye at general ruin believe remember that who will be called out will go if affair go a fear that will do man under fifty year old in france will have to go out be not enough to go out for war like will require desperate courage endurance absolute disregard of life to counterbalance disadvantage of want of discipline want of arm want of artillery want of organization may be wrong hope that be so time will show do think that there be chance of coming down here a well a of going to paris papa percy asked must depend upon length of resistance percy if france hold out refuse to grant term prussian might try to impose upon may overrun country a town be directly upon way for lyon second town of france be exceedingly likely to come way well if do papa ralph said with heightened color feel sure that man who can carry gun will go out that home will be defended will see ralph captain barclay said will see pause then came news of terrible three day fighting on th th th near metz when bazaine retreat towards paris cut off vainly tried to force way through prussian army failing fell back into metz even now when position be well nigh desperate with only great army remaining shut up surrounded with nothing save fragment of macmahon division with few other regiment collected in haste new levy encamped at chalons between victorious enemy capital people of france be scarcely awake to urgency of position government concealed at least portion of truth people be only too ready to be deceived in dijon however fact be better known more understood swiss newspaper containing prussian official telegram account arrived daily who received speedily spread news through town consternation be great general there be sign of despair of mobile who be armed equipped be sent off at once to chalons at corner of street be placard calling out mobile soldier who have served time although not yet called to arm national guard drilled in place d'armes morning evening will allow richard that be mistaken a to patriotism of people mr barclay said one evening to husband everyone be rushing to arm be coming out better than have expected melanie at same time will observe that have choice in matter mobile be called out have to go who can raise most frivolous pretext for exemption do so there be perfect rush of young men to prefecture to obtain place in clothing medical arming equipping department in sort of service in fact will exempt holder from taking up arm at same time there be great deal of true earnest patriotism many married men with family have volunteered belonging to category called out do go a say cheerfully if not willingly once enrolled appear determined to do duty france will need patriotism devotion of people to get through present crisis there be saying how will end have hope whatever that macmahon new army can arrest march of enemy true course be to fall back upon paris chance here of remaining free from visit of enemy depends entirely upon length of time strasburg metz hold out bazaine may be able to cut way out at rate be likely to remain where be for little time under wall of metz for occupies attention of considerably larger force than command vital point at present be to cut road behind german if be not for cork leg of mine melanie must try raise small guerrilla corp set out on own account have lived here for seventeen year now french fought by side in crimea must do so must certainly fight for france now be clearly duty of anyone who can carry musket to go out just at moment door opened ralph percy entered hastily looked excited serious what be boy papa ralph said there be notice up signed by friend captain tempe call for hundred volunteer to join corp of franc tireurs sort of guerrilla believe to go out to harass german cut communication who can be to provide own arm equipment meeting be to be held tonight for subscribing money for who can not afford to do so have come to ask to let join papa louis philippe have just gone to ask uncle leave captain barclay listened in silence with very grave face mother sat down in chair with white face oh boy be too young gasped out be stronger mamma than great many of men who have be called out taller stouter in way can walk better than greater portion of be accustomed to exercise fatigue be far more fit to be soldier than many young men who have gone from here said mamma that everyone who must carry gun ought to go out be not french boy mr barclay said piteously be half french mamma not legally have be home to since be born even if have not be french ought to fight for mr barclay looked at husband for assistance captain barclay have leaned face in hand said nothing ah ralph percy at least be only fifteen be nearly a big nearly a strong a ralph mamma besides must not be better to have two of if one be ill wounded other must look after know mamma dearest have talked over think ought to go be very strong for age be strength not year matter mamma said frenchwoman must not grudge love to france that if france be invaded all even woman must go out mr barclay be silent must not speak be so deadly pale face have expression of misery that boy felt resolution wavering captain barclay looked up boy said very gravely have one question to ask will answer truly upon faith honor do wish to go merely principally from desire to see excitement adventure of guerrilla war do go out because desire earnestly to do best to defend country in be born lived be prepared to suffer hardship if be will of god to die for be papa boy said ralph went on when first talked over possibility of everyone being called out of going too did look upon a case of fun excitement when chance really came saw how serious be knew how much must cost dear mamma must not have asked have not felt that ought to go even if knew must be killed in case boy captain barclay said solemnly rising laying one hand on shoulder of of son in case say more be soldier son example may do good be duty that of everyone to fight for country give full consent to go must not have advised at age there be absolute duty still if feel so will not stand in way go then boy may god watch over keep send safe home again so saying kissed on forehead walked from room without saying word then boy turned to mother who be cry silently falling upon neck kissed cried with be understood that consent be given with father milly coming in hearing be matter sat down in sudden grief astonishment on nearest chair cried bitterly be sad half hour boy be almost inclined to regret that have asked for leave to go however there be drawing back now when left mother went on to tell cousin that be going found louis philippe in state of great disappointment because father have altogether refused to listen to entreaty upon hearing however that ralph percy be going gained fresh hope for said if english boy must go fight for france be shameful that french boy must stay at home in idleness captain barclay after giving permission to son to go a franc tireurs first went for walk by to think over consequence of decision then went down into dijon called upon captain tempe commander of proposed corp have served for many year in zouaves be known to be able energetic officer have left service five six year previously upon marriage lived short distance only from captain barclay warm friendship have sprung up between upon captain barclay telling why have come to see captain tempe expressed satisfaction at decision of young barclays have already name of one two lad little if older than eldest boy said although other be certainly very young yet a be very stout strong for age have doubt will bear fatigue a well a many of men wish must go with captain barclay said wish must indeed captain tempe replied warmly with leg never must keep up on foot horse must be out of question among forest of vosges mountain might however if will be of great use in assisting to drill discipline recruit before starting will do with pleasure captain barclay said have be thinking of offering service in way to municipality a very few of officer of mobile still le of national guard know duty a be will devote to corp till march in first place how strong do mean to be one strong company say one hundred twenty men captain tempe answered more than must be too unwieldy for guerrilla work must rather have twenty le than more indeed must be quite satisfied with hundred if find that volunteer come in in greater number than can accept will advise to get up other similar corp there ought to be score of small party hanging upon rear flank of enemy interrupting communication how do think of arming with chassepots with english rifle be of use applying to government will not be able to arm mobile for month to say nothing of national guard must buy rifle in england belgium will be difficult to get chassepots so think best plan will be to decide at once upon sniders know gentleman who be connected with matter in england will if like send out order at once for say eleven dozen sniders to be forwarded via rouen thence by rail must be very glad if must do so captain tempe said have doubt about getting that number of recruit easily enough have have good many call already morning several thousand franc of subscription have be promised in three four day money will be ready so if write to friend to make agreement with manufacturer can give money by time answer arrives when gun arrive who can pay for will do so rest will be paid for by subscription of course will want complete with bayonet if at same time can order ammunition say two hundred round for rifle must be perhaps saving of time a government may not be able to supply at first however after meeting evening will see how subscription come in can settle on point tomorrow municipality will help have doubt what be idea a to equipment tempe a light a possible nothing destroys go of men more than to be obliged to carry heavy weight on shoulder will be essentially guerrilla attack to be successful must be surprise speed therefore power to march long distance be first of essential propose to carry knapsack mere haversack bag capable of containing spare shirt couple of pair of sock three day biscuit man must also carry spare pair of boot strapped to belt behind thick blanket with hole cut for head so a to make cloak by day cover by night will be carried rolled up over one shoulder like scarf man must carry light waterproof coat propose to take even tent d'abri add considerably to weight unless when be actually engaged in expedition will make headquarters at village when men can be dispersed among cottage sleep in stable barn when on expedition must sleep in open air quite approve of plan captain barclay said exclusive of rifle ammunition weight need not be above fifteen pound man with ought to be able to march fight with comfort way soldier march out laden like beast of burden be absurd be impossible for men to march fight with heavy load upon back have thought about uniform have not settled at thought of letting men fix upon one of own choice hing of sort captain barclay said men will only think of what be most becoming picturesque can not do better than fix upon good serviceable uniform of dark grayish color something similar to of of english volunteer corp will give drawing of let tunic be made of thick good cloth let men have short trouser a call knickerbockers with leather gaiter lace boot shoe of soldier be altogether mistake will bring sketch tomorrow will see that be neat a well a serviceable thank by way suppose that have objection to mentioning at meeting evening that son have joined if there must be inclination to hang back hope there will not be fact that boy have joined may decide many who must otherwise hesitate certainly will not detain longer at present will see in day two assistance can give be at service thanks very much only wish that must go with goodbye tell boy name be down that will begin drill in day two chapter death to spy next morning madame duburg arrived at ten o'clock hour at have never a far a mr barclay knew turned out of house since marriage be actually walking fast too be evident that something serious be matter mr barclay be in garden visitor came straight out from house to be anything matter be mr barclay first question yes great deal be matter madame duburg began vehemently english husband be mad wretched boy be mad have made son mad also faith believe that husband will catch be enough to make also mad notwithstanding trouble in mr barclay be at resolution of son must scarcely help smiling at excitement of madame duburg cause of at once guessed however asked with air of astonishment dear sister in law what can be talking about know what say madame duburg continued always said that be mad husband to let boy go about play tear bruise like wild indian always knew that harm must come of when saw boy come in hot oh so unpleasantly hot to look at did not think of such harm a faith be incredible when heard that be to marry to englishman said at once 'it be bad harm will come of english be islander be eccentric be mad sell wife in market with cord round neck dear sister in law mr barclay interrupted have so often assured that absurd statement be entirely false due only to absolute ignorance of nation of everything outside have heard often madame duburg

offended late in evening husband came in have long talk with captain barclay following morning louis philippe came in in high state of delight to say that father have that morning given consent to going in three day after opening of list hundred twenty men have inscribed name captain tempe refused to admit more number be argued source of weakness rather than of strength when men be almost entirely ignorant of drill for sudden attack for night march for attack upon convoy number be le needed than dash speed among large body discipline can not be kept up except by immense severity upon part of officer by existence of feeling of discipline obedience among men be gained only by long custom to military habit besides difficulty of obtaining provision for large body of men must be enormous indeed captain tempe determined to organize even small corp into four company of thirty men to act under one head to join together upon occasion of important expedition at other time to be divided among village at such distance a must enable to watch large extent of country company sending out scout outpost in own neighborhood by far larger proportion of who joined be proprietor son of

yourselves to affair wish to know exactly what be that be going to do will be holiday expedition can promise who go with plenty of excitement great deal of fighting can also promise with equal certainty immense deal of suffering amount of hardship privation of at present few here have idea whatever winter be fast coming on winter in vosges mountain be trifle let one then put down name here who be not prepared to suffer hardship be well possible to suffer a to danger say nothing be frenchman have come forward to die if need be for country here speaker be interrupted by loud cheering cry of vive la france next a to discipline be extremely important point in absence from military station be essential that must keep enforce strictest discipline have morning received from general palikao under whom served for many year answer to application wrote to week since highly approves of plan of cutting road behind prussian only wish that have hundred small corp out upon same errand have already received other proposal of same nature enclosed with letter formal appointment a commandant of corp of franc tireurs of dijon with full military authority power great cheering again broke out power in case of need warn that will use unhesitatingly discipline in corp like ours be everything there must be murmuring under hardship hesitation in obeying order however unpleasant prompt willing cheerful obedience when at work warm friendship perfect good fellowship at other time be programme speaker be again interrupted with hearty cheering intend to divide corp into four company of thirty men company will have officer will at time act independently of other have deliberated whether be best to allow company to choose own officer whether to nominate have determined to adopt latter course can hardly be such good judge a to quality required by officer during expedition like present a be a know man here a will have opportunity of seeing more of man during three week will spend here upon drill will then choose officer for company will leave to company to decide whether to accept choice not there may be point in man character may make unpopular now a to drill have three week before not long enough to make men good soldier amply sufficient with hard work to make good skirmisher have already arranged with four men who have served a non commissioned officer in army one of whom will take company captain barclay who be well known to most of have kindly offered to give musketry instruction for four hour morning ten men of company will go morning for week to drill at range so that in three week man will have have week instruction hour will be from seven to eleven others will drill during same hour will drill together in afternoon from three to six officer commanding troop here

men separated next morning corp met be divided into company division be alphabetical young barclays duburgs be in first company be matter of great pleasure to a have be afraid that might have be separated following day drill began in earnest accustomed a boy be to exercise found seven hour day hard work of still felt very much le than many of young men who for year have done little lounge in cafe stroll at promenade however stuck to work a heart be in be surprising how quickly picked up rudiment of drill fortunately be not required to learn anything beyond management of firearm simplest movement duty of skirmisher a complicated maneuver must have be useless in small corp whose duty must be confined entirely to skirmishing with branch of work captain tempe be determined that must be thoroughly acquainted be taught how to use cover of kind with advantage how to defend building crenelate wall fell tree to form obstacle across road breastwork in front of how to throw into square rapidly to repel cavalry captain barclay be indefatigable a musketry instructor with aid of few friend got up subscription be spent in number of small prize so a to give men a much interest a possible in work captain tempe impressed most strenuously upon men extreme importance of proficiency in shooting a be upon accuracy deadliness of fire that must have to rely to enable to contend with superior force in combat must have to go through man must probably have frequently to depend for life upon accuracy of fire original plan of instructing third of men week in musketry be abandoned party be changed day in order to enable to advance at equal rate besides ammunition be supplied so that who chose to do so must practice shooting for own amusement between morning afternoon drill barclays be constant in attendance at shooting ground steady hand eye cricket fencing other exercise have given now stood in good stead for by end of time became a good marksman a in corp still lived at home a did member of corp whose residence be in around dijon for who lived too far away to come in out day to drill large empty barn be taken fitted up a temporary barrack time did not pas away without great excitement for a end of august drew on everyone be watching in deep anxiety for news of battle near chalons where macmahon have be organizing fresh army then came news that camp at chalons be broken up that macmahon be marching to relief of bazaine two three day of anxious expectation followed then on rd of september came news through switzerland of utter defeat surrender of french army at sedan at first news seemed too terrible to be true people seemed stunned at thought of hundred thousand frenchman laying down arm two day later came news of revolution in paris excited various emotion among people prevailing idea seemed to be that now there be republic past disaster must be retrieved what do think of news papa boy asked a drill over hurried up to talk matter over with father with other people must consider to be most unfortunate event must have possibly occurred captain barclay said change of government involving change of official throughout department perfect upset of whole machinery of organization appears little short of insanity at same time be possible that may arouse burst of national enthusiasm that resistance a far a civil population be concerned have a yet be contemptible in fact have not be attempted at may become of so obstinate desperate character that prussian may be fairly wearied out there be scarcely hope of future victory in field raw levy however plucky can be match for such troop a prussian in open only hope be in mass of franc tireurs upon rear flank of enemy bridge wood village must be defended to death in way prussian must only hold ground stand on must be absolutely impossible for to feed immense army to bring up siege materiel against paris spirit to do may possibly be excited by revolution otherwise france be lost success alone can excuse for more senseless more unjustifiable more shameful revolution be in mind never made have be effected purely by radical rough of paris men who have for year be advocating war with prussia who month ago be screaming 'to berlin ' for men to turn round upon emperor in misfortune without consulting rest of france to effect revolution be in mind simply infamous even regarded a matter of policy be bad in extreme austria italy russia to say nothing of england must sooner later have interfered in favor of established empire sympathy will be chilled by revolution democratic party in country may exult extreme democratic party hold rein of power anywhere monarch will certainly not feel called upon to assist to establish republic prussia intensely aristocratic in institution will probably refuse to treat altogether with schemer who have seized power for king of prussia be perhaps greatest hater of democracy in europe still boy change make difference in duty be fighting for france not for empire republic a long a france resists be duty to continue in fact be now more than ever duty of of frenchman to fight army be entirely gone be simply upon pluck energy of population that have to trust do think paris will hold out papa be sure to do so boy have made revolution be bound to defend know paris well fortification be far too strong to be taken by sudden attack will be long time before prussian can bring up siege train paris will only be starved out if people be only half a brave a be turbulent ought to render impossible for prussian to blockade immense circle at rate france have two month perhaps much longer two month ought to be quite enough if people have spirit to surround enemy to cut off supply to force to retreat next morning when corp assembled for drill captain tempe addressed on subject of event in paris told that whether approved disapproved of what have taken place there duty a frenchman be plain for present be not politician patriot hoped that not word of politics must be spoken in corp that everyone must give whole thought whole strength if must be life in cause of france address be greatly applauded gave immense satisfaction to men for already difference of opinion be becoming manifest among have exulted loudly at downfall of napoleon others have said little gloomy look have testified sufficiently what be opinion while many among gentleman in corp especially belonging to old family be well known to be attached to legitimist orleanist prince proposal therefore politics must be discussed during war that must remember only that be fighting for france gave great satisfaction promised continuance of good fellowship have hitherto reigned in corp be great day when fortnight from first organization corp turned out for first time in uniform band of national guard headed a marched down high street of dijon to parade ground a spectator cheered lady waved handkerchief whole corp joined in cheer to stirring note of marseillaise young

inhabitant fourteen mile on day after to baccarat on river meurthe where also obtained quarter be now approaching neighborhood of enemy major tempe advised halt for next day in order that might make inquiry investigate thoroughly best route to be pursued chapter first engagement news commandant of franc tireurs heard at baccarat determined to change intention to push on without delay to halloville tiny hamlet on lower spur of vosges four mile from blamont overlooking valley of vexouse in latter town be situated be long march weather have again changed rain descending day in steady pour men in light waterproof cloak flap of forage cap down plodded steadily on spirit sustained by thought ere twenty four hour might be in action news hurried forward have be to effect that body of two hundred uhlans have left sarrebourg be advancing towards blamont be going quietly stopping to levy contribution at village on way be probable that must enter blamont on same evening that franc tireurs reached halloville be supposed that must proceed with sheep cattle that have swept up by valley of vexouse to luneville to within four mile of halloville road have be fair one be here necessary to turn off by track be little better than goat path in vain dozen of men be told off to help with cart in vain pushed behind shoved at spoke of wheel road be altogether impracticable at last horse cart be taken aside into thick wood left there with tim doyle corporal six of men who be most footsore incapable of pushing on tim be dreadfully disgusted at being thus cut off from chance of seeing joining in fighting only consoled with hope that vacancy must be likely to occur next day that must then be able to exchange whip for rifle rest of corp plodded on until long after dusk arrived at half dozen house form village of appearance a marched up to be greeted by scream from woman followed by perfect chorus of scream cry men woman child be seen rushing out of house taking to flight be with greatest difficulty that be made to understand truth that formidable body have so suddenly dropped upon be not composed of dreaded invader when truth be known did best to receive hospitably mean however be small house equally so however in short time blazing fire be lighted on hearth blanket having be put up before window to prevent light being visible from valley fire be allotted for cooking of company preparation for supper be soon commenced then examination be made of facility in way of sleeping two barn be found well provided with straw be shaken out after eating supper men packed close together upon straw soon forgot damp fatigue numerous sentry being thrown out in various direction to prevent possibility of surprise for peasant have informed that information have received be correct that uhlans about two hundred strong have entered blamont afternoon have laid requisition of twenty thousand franc upon inhabitant besides considerable amount of store of sort at three o'clock be roused found to great pleasure that rain have ceased guided by one of villager made way down to point where wood approached quite close to road at narrow point of valley here major tempe posted men along in wood several coil of wire have be brought with be now stretched tightly from tree to tree at distance of about eighteen inch from ground forty yard farther back young tree be felled branch cut be laid with bushy part towards road wire being twisted here there among so a to form abattis perfectly impenetrable for horseman difficult in extreme for infantry worked hard by eight o'clock in morning everything be in readiness small party have be left upon high ground near halloville one of have brought down news half hour soon after daybreak party of uhlans have be seen to leave blamont to visit barbas harboise two village in flat of blamont then to retire driving cattle sheep before at ten o'clock rest of men from halloville came down with news that uhlans about two hundred strong have just left blamont be coming down valley man now took station allotted to thirty men behind tree next to road main body being stationed behind abattis man having previously settled upon spot where must fire through leaf entirely concealed from view from road number one company be placed to right consequently near to blamont ralph percy be in front line behind tree not shot be to be fired on consideration until major tempe gave word men behind tree be all ordered to lie down among low undergrowth brushwood line extended nearly hundred yard waterproof blanket other impediment have be left behind at halloville so that men have free use of arm rifle be loaded pouch shifted round so a to be ready at hand order having be given that not word must be spoken even in whisper perfect silence reigned over spot ralph percy be near to other have exchanged hearty grip of hand before lying down now lay with beating heart hand firmly grasping rifle in readiness for signal time be not very long only few minute seemed to age before heard tramp of horse nearer nearer came now must hear jingling of accouterment first through leafy screen must see two uhlans pas at walk scanning keenly wood looking for possible danger bush be thick noticed nothing kept on at same pace be probable indeed that really anticipated possibility of attack a dijon franc tireurs be first who appeared upon scene of action prussian be consequently in entire ignorance of vicinity of armed body of enemy at worst apprehended stray shot from straggler from one of french army hidden in wood in minute two four more uhlans passed after same interval came main body escorting number of cattle sheep greater portion have passed spot where boy be lying be opposite whole line of franc tireurs when silence of wood be broken by major tempe shout now before uhlans have time to rein in horse to ask other be meaning of cry flash of thirty rifle broke from tree several men fell from horse there be momentary panic followed by hurried discharge of carbine at invisible foe captain of uhlans handsome young officer with light mustache beard shouted to men steady be only handful form line charge quickly a maneuver be executed franc tireurs have time to fire again then in accordance with order retreated joined comrade by passage left in abattis on purpose in instant uhlans charged a quickly direst confusion reigned where before have be regular line wire have served purpose horse men went down on top of other thirty rifle again fumed deadly hail into confused mass second line of uhlans who have not charged returned fire of invisible enemy although must not see several of ball took effect nothing must be cooler than officer of uhlans voice example steadied men under cover of fire of comrade men in part extricated horse drew back behind wood order be then given for to dismount leaving horse to be held by party of comrade four horse to one man rest advanced on foot against apparently greatly inferior foe keeping up heavy fire with carbine be what commandant of franc tireurs have hoped for expected wire have be broken down by weight of horse prussian advanced opposed only by feeble return to heavy fire until within five pace of leafy wall then fire from hundred rifle flashed out upon effect be terrible cry of surprise rage burst from who have escaped effect be evident that have fallen into ambush captain wild with rage mortification at fault have committed rushed forward men gallantly seconded effort in vain however did try to separate interlaced bough while a struggled shot from enemy flashed out thick fast in moment young captain threw up arm fell shot through heart officer next in command ordered retreat horse be regained amidst continuous fire from franc tireurs diminished troop galloped back towards blamont franc tireurs now quitted leafy fortress small party be at once sent forward up valley to give notice if uhlans showed sign of returning strong body set to work to drive in scattered animal be galloping wildly about valley while rest collected dead wounded of franc tireurs eight be killed fourteen wounded of uhlans forty seven be killed nineteen wounded remained on ground large number of killed in proportion to wounded be accounted for by fact that firing be so close that in many case coat of dead men be actually singed by explosion while slightly wounded men have be able to regain horse escape first impulse of young barclays when fire ceased be to turn round to embrace other with delight on finding that have escaped without scratch then to shake hand heartily with cousin whose fortune have be equally good there be time for word however for major tempe order came sharp decisive barclays also duburgs sling arm go assist to drive in cattle quick lose time have done well be content with boy with flush of pleasure boy started off to carry out order have be given by commander with kind thought of sparing lad terrible sight of battle ground short desperate conflict through have passed seemed to young barclays almost like dream in excitement of loading firing in tumult rattle have scarcely have time even to give thought to danger fear be seldom felt by soldier when engaged in close conflict time when nerve be most tried be while waiting inactive at distance exposed to heavy shell fire while advancing to attack under storm of musketry artillery in hand to hand conflict have time to think nerve be strung up to so high pitch that no longer think of danger death whole thought be given to loading firing thought that boy have given to danger be not for for other ralph though own position be unsheltered have once twice spoken to percy to keep body better sheltered by tree behind be standing be long chase before frightened animal be collected together driven up towards spot where fight have taken place by time that be accomplished wounded have be collected surgeon have bandaged many of wound qualified surgeon have accompanied corp a regular doctor two other young surgeon have enlisted in rank arm laid by be now assisting to stanch wound to apply bandage of franc tireurs there be only four so seriously wounded that be unable to walk by time two cart arrived from village of douteppe stood in valley mile only from scene of action to place major tempe have sent off messenger directly affair have terminated in one of wounded be placed while in other be piled arm accouterment of fallen uhlans one of young surgeon be to accompany wounded a far a baccarat where be to remain for treatment twenty three horse of uhlans have also be captured by party who have driven in cattle among whom be galloping four men be told off to take back to epinal there dispose of with accouterment for benefit of military chest of corp question then arose a to what be to be done with prussian wounded major tempe decided by saying that a be quite impossible for corp to be burdened with wounded men best plan be to allow one of slightly wounded among prisoner to walk back to blamont with message that uhlans must come back to fetch wounded without molestation a franc tireurs be upon point of taking departure corp then assembled round grave have already be dug into body of comrade who have fallen be placed major tempe then said few brief word of adieu hoping that who fell might die equally bravely victoriously then sod be shoveled in men saddened by scene though still flushed with triumph of first signal success prepared to leave spot major tempe have already held consultation with officer plan of operation have be decided upon difficulty have encountered evening before with horse cart have already proved that must be impossible to drag about with have also taken thirty fine cattle upwards of hundred sheep from enemy be therefore resolved to establish sort of headquarters in mountain where must retire after expedition defy effort of prussian to disturb spot fixed upon be forest of bousson high up among vosges distant two hard day marching portion of troop therefore went round to halloville to fetch accouterment blanket etc have be left there while rest marched by road to place where cart have be left night before two peasant be engaged a guide in afternoon corp started for destination be terrible march road be mere track weather be terrible over over again men have to unload cart shoulder content carry for considerable distance until ground be reached where cart must again be loaded be not until late on evening of third day march that thoroughly done up by fatigue hardship corp reached little village of raon in heart of forest of bousson there be possible fear of attack here commandant decided that for night there be occasion for of men to be out a sentry villager at once took charge of animal turned into rough enclosure men be too much done up even to care about keeping awake until supper must be cooked being divided among house of village threw down be fast asleep in few minute next morning sun shone out brightly men turning out after long sleep felt quite different creature to tired band who have wearily crawled into village bright sky fresh morning air pleasant odor of great pine forest around bracing atmosphere at height of fifteen hundred foot above sea at once refreshed cheered there be brief morning parade at tim doyle for first time took place with rifle on shoulder then major dismissed saying that there must be further parade day that men must amuse a liked in short time man be following bent of own inclination first however there be general cleaning of rifle accouterment then most of men went down to stream there be great washing of clothes accompanied with much laughing joking then needle thread be obtained from woman of village there be much mending darning for past three day work among rock wood have done little damage to uniform next came grand operation of breakfast for two of sheep have be killed being first regular meal that have have for three day be greatly enjoyed after be eaten most of men lit pipe prepared to pas day of delightful idleness two three of village boy have be engaged a cowherd shepherd animal be driven out into wood where in open glade must find abundance of food cart be unanimously condemned a worse than useless empty shed be turned into storehouse be determined that such store of powder etc a might be required upon expedition must be packed upon horse back if horse must not take required that other horse must be hired barclays with cousin started for ramble in wood taking with irishman whose good humor unflagging spirit during last three day have made general favorite sure be there wild baste in wood honor because if there be must be well to take rifle with must be mighty unpleasant to come across lion tiger not to be able to pas time of day tim will meet lion tiger so need not trouble with rifle hundred year ago might have met with bear wild boar have disappeared long since be possible that there be few wolf scattered about be never formidable to solitary person even in winter at other time fly from man approach party have charming ramble for scenery here be very fine at time forest be so thick that must see glimpse of sky trunk of tree seemed to make wall round then again must open must obtain glimpse over country far away rise beyond rise to plain of champagne if view be behind instead of in front of must see top of highest range of vosges rising hill above hill often wooded to very summit donon one of highest point of range being immediately behind village be here few far between people extremely poor for soil be poor although in summer cattle form only wealth be able to pick up abundance of food in forest have hard struggle to keep alive during winter language be german appearance dress rather german than french notwithstanding be thoroughly french in spirit regarded invader with intense hatred day passed in rest completely restored most exhausted of band order be therefore issued for early start next morning object time being to endeavor to cut railway band be to march in body for slope of vosges behind sarrebourg saverne be then to divide into company scatter among village between lorquin marmontier so a to act together separately a might seem expedient chapter tunnel of saverne be needle to follow corp step by step through march for name of little village through passed must not be found in map published in england must therefore posse little interest for english reader after two day long march main body of corp reached village situated in wood at about four mile from great rock tunnel of saverne fourth company have be left at village five mile to left while third company be next day to march forward to place at about same distance to right order be to keep sharp lookout to collect news of movement strength of enemy not to undertake expedition to do anything to lead enemy to guess at presence in neighborhood a be of vital importance that must not be put upon guard until great blow be struck a soon a have marched into village principal inhabitant came forward consultation be held a to providing lodging after conversation be agreed that officer must have quarter in village that schoolroom two in number must be placed at disposal of men be good sized room must hold thirty men without difficulty company who be to march forward in morning be provided with quarter in village ralph percy barclay a usual acted a interpreter between major tempe inhabitant for major of officer spoke german that language indeed be spoken only by few men in whole corp commandant have divided among other company in order that company might be able to shift for when separated from main body have seen proclamation one of villager asked see that be running little risk in taking in ralph read a did so face flushed with indignation exclaimed be infamous infamous what be major tempe asked be proclamation from prussian general commanding district major giving notice that will shoot franc tireur may catch also giving notice to inhabitant that if prussian soldier be killed even shot at by franc tireur if rail be pulled up road cut that will hold village near spot accountable will burn house treat male inhabitant according to martial law that same penalty will be exacted for sheltering hiding franc tireurs impossible major tempe said astounded officer of civilized army must issue edict besides during invasion of germany people be summoned by king of prussia to take up arm to cut road destroy bridge shoot down enemy just a be going to do now be too atrocious to be true there be in black white ralph said there can be no mistake a to wording major tempe looked grieved a well a indignant will be terrible business said if war be to be carried on in way of course if give quarter will give none be must make a many prisoner a can in order that if of men be taken prisoner may carry out reprisal if shoot will besides do great harm naturally villager instead of looking upon a defender will regard a most dangerous of guest will argue 'if make resistance prussian may plunder at least house life be safe whereas if franc tireurs be found to have be with if make attack in neighborhood be not only plundered burnt out shot ' of course be always liable to treachery there be scoundrel always to be found who must sell own mother now even most patriotic can not feel that be running immense risk in sheltering never before believe in annals of civilized nation did man in authority dare to proclaim that person must suffer for crime with have nothing whatever to do if arrive at little village how be people to say to 'we will not allow to pull up rail yet if prevent be to be punished with fire sword people call civilized nation one of evil consequence of proclamation be that will never dare trust to inhabitant to make inquiry for will be so alarmed in case must attempt anything in neighborhood that must be sure to do say everything must to dissuade from if inclined to treachery might even try to buy own safety by betraying major tempe be speaking to other officer who thoroughly agreed with opinion ralph percy have remained in room in case further question might be asked in reference to proclamation now asked if anything else be required upon negative answer being given saluted took leave be dusk when went out a walked towards schoolroom heard great tumult of voice raised in anger among recognized that of tim doyle howld yer jaw jabbering ape exclaimed in great wrath give lantern candle let begone boy be waiting for to begin hurrying up found tim surrounded by few of principal inhabitant of village soon learned cause of dispute supper be served be too dark to see to eat tim always ready to make useful have volunteered to go in search of light have in vain used few word of french with villager met have at last called schoolmaster only person in village who understood french man have addressed tim first in french then in german upon receiving coherent answer in language have arrived at conclusion that tim be making fun of hence dispute have arisen boy explained matter villager whose knowledge of england be of very vaguest description most of whom indeed have previously believed that world spoke french german be profuse in apology immediately procured candle with tim boy hastened to schoolroom two candle be given to company one being lighted at end of room stuck upon nail in wall boy be enabled to see what place be like clean straw have be littered foot deep down side of room fifteen blanket be folded side by side along by wall upon peg above meant for scholar cap hung haversack water bottle other accouterment while rifle be piled along center of room leaving space enough to walk down upon side between bed at farther end of room be large fireplace in log fire be blazing small shed outside have be converted into kitchen might be worse off than long way ralph said louis duburg a ralph took place on straw next to that might louis fire look cheerful too night be getting very cold that be ralph ah here be supper be quite ready for too men who officiated a cook who by agreement have be released from night duty in consideration of regularly undertaking that occupation now brought in large saucepan full of soup man went up with canteen received portion returning to bed upon straw to eat anything new barclay one of men asked from other side of room yes indeed ralph said new disagreeable mind none of get taken prisoner for prussian general have issued proclamation that will shoot franc tireurs catch impossible came in general chorus from present well sound like be true enough ralph repeated word for word proclamation have translated to major tempe a might have be expected raised perfect storm of indignation lasted until at nine o'clock sergeant gave word light out in morning after parade ralph percy strolled away together have long talk at end of hour walked to house where major tempe have established headquarters good morning friend said a entered be there anything can do for sit down have be thinking sir percy that must very easily dress up a peasant go down to saverne anywhere might think fit find out particular a to strength position of enemy one must suspect two boy of being franc tireurs must be unlikely in extreme that anyone must ask question if be asked must say belonged to village in mountain have come down to buy coffee other necessary risk of detection must be next to nothing for speak german quite well enough to pas for lad from mountain major tempe be silent minute know must be shot at once if be detected doubt sir there be reason in world why must be detected prussian ca know everyone by sight even within town will not notice at if do answer be sufficient tell frankly boy be thinking only last night of matter however much may make light of there be of course certain amount of danger in acting a spy father friend captain barclay might say to if evil came of ' gave boy to fight for france have sent to death a spy so resolved to say nothing about now have offered case be different ralph said from knowledge of language from age be better fitted than anyone in corp to perform service therefore must be clearly duty to perform be greatly more dangerous than be father said to at starting 'do duty boy whatever danger will see about clothes there can be difficulty about there be several lad in village whose thing must fit will come in afternoon for instruction thank lad major tempe said warmly trust with that harm will come of offer be of too great advantage to corp for to persist in refusal upon leaving quarter of commandant boy went at once to house of farmer short distance from village where day before have noticed two boy of about own size explained to farmer that wanted to buy of suit of working clothes of of son greatly surprised at request farmer have inquired what must possibly want for ralph who thought better not to trust with secret replied that a prussian general have given notice that must shoot franc tireurs might take prisoner wanted suit of clothes might slip on in case of defeat danger of capture pretense be plausible one farmer sold required clothes charging only about twice cost when new boy took parcel instead of returning to village direct hid carefully in wood at short distance away then returned in afternoon received detailed instruction from major tempe be arranged that matter must be kept entirely secret lest incautious word might be overheard reported be to start at daybreak upon following morning cousin tim doyle being alone taken into confidence friend regretted much that must not accompany share danger boy pointed out however that even must have spoken german fluently must not have gone with a although two stranger must excite attention five must be certain to do so next morning started together a if for walk upon reaching spot in wood where peasant clothes be hidden boy took off uniform be wrapped up concealed in same place put on clothes fitted fairly more than be not necessary a peasant clothes be seldom cut accurately to figure rounding shoulder walking with clumping sort of stride one must have imagined that be other than pretended to be two awkward looking young alsatian lad cut two heavy stick exchanged hearty goodbye with friend started for saverne two hour later be walking in street staring into shop window at everything be going on with open mouthed curiosity of two young country lad then made few purchase coffee sugar pepper tied in colored pocket handkerchief then went into small cabaret where saw german soldier drinking sat down at table called for bread cheese beer while be taking listened to conversation of soldier only information that gleaned from be that men seemed to have expectation whatever of early movement that be heartily sick of monotony of place hard work of patrolling line of railway night day presently soldier paid for beer left of townspeople came in took place have left conversation of course turned on prussian occupation deep be curse heaped upon invader only thing mentioned in favor be smallness of number there be not over two hundred men amount weighed lightly upon saverne compared with fifty sixty hundred quartered at little village along line of railway boy have now learned what most wanted to know paying for refreshment went out again into street then walked to railway station where saw several soldier on guard then set off to point where must see entrance to tunnel there two soldier be on guard while others be stationed at short distance along line boy now went up to wood whence unseen must watch train passing came along nearly half hour immensely long train filled with store of kind a became dusk saw body of prussian soldier marching down line relieving sentry placing fresh one at distance of little more than fifty yard apart marched backwards forward until met other then returning until faced comrade at other end of beat can be off now percy ralph said rising news be bad for will be by mean so easy to cut line a have expected weasel wo be very easily caught asleep indeed percy said idea of cutting line sounded so easy when be at distance be quite different matter now be here upon return found with difficulty place where have hidden uniform again changed clothes then carrying have just taken off made up into bundle re entered village went straight to headquarters major tempe be at dinner with other officer received with great pleasure for have be anxious day lest misfortune might befall finding that have have nothing to eat since early in morning at once invited to sit down to dinner for military discipline be far le strict in matter in france than be in england among corp of franc tireurs especially a among english volunteer where private be in many case equal to superior to officer in social standing difference of rank be very much put aside except on duty say that have sentinel at fifty sixty yard along line major tempe said when ralph have given account of day investigation appears to to be fatal to plan why so lieutenant de maupas who commanded first company asked seems to that nothing must be easier suppose fell upon given point sentry near must be at once killed made prisoner even allowing a young barclay say that there be troop in village must be good half hour before force sufficient to disturb must arrive be true enough major tempe answered what must do in hour might pull up two hundred yard of rail what real advantage must be gained by that line of sentry along rail must by firing rifle pas news ten mile in half a many minute train must be stopped long before arrived at break train carry know workman material for repairing line a must be impossible for to carry away rail after pulling up must be replaced in a short time a took to tear up consequence must be that traffic must only be suspended for hour two at most for break to be of real utility must last for day if not for week great coup of course must be destruction of rock tunnel of saverne be special object of presence here failing that must try bridge tunnel however be great affair once destroyed there must be repairing for many week proposition be therefore that turn attention at once to point there be general murmur of assent best course must be for hardin company to march direct to other end of tunnel seize prevent interference from end while others then seize saverne end hold while preparation be made for blowing up then when match be lighted fall back if possible before arrival of heavy body of enemy nothing must be better lieutenant de maupas exclaimed other officer agreed with what day do propose for movement day after tomorrow at daybreak major tempe said will give plenty of time to send order to other two company sooner be done better conference be about to break up when surgeon who have listened in silence said general plan be simple enough tell how do propose to set about blowing tunnel up may be able to hold for hour at most how do think of proceeding major tempe officer looked at other have not a yet thought matter over instant be put plainly before saw difficulty oh lieutenant de maupas said confidently will of course put nitroglycerine somewhere in middle of tunnel blow whole affair up lieutenant de maupas have be sailor quickness of decision go ahead straight forward way of doing everything made at once favorite amusement to men who have nicknamed grande vitesse a must say in english express be afraid matter be rather more difficult than imagine de maupas major tempe said with smile be in ribouville way a be in engineer will know about officer named however did not reply for little time sat with head on hand in deep thought feel ashamed to own said at last really know how one must set about matter so a to have chance of really destroying tunnel after so short time for preparation be tunnel ordinary brick lined tunnel proposition of de maupas slightly modified must no doubt have effect of bringing down brick lining earth behind must fall in of with tunnel cut in solid rock must be difficult natural strength of tunnel must be so great that force of explosion must simply be lost through end might might not bring down few mass of rock one must not rely upon doing even that if have time matter must be easy enough must make deep chamber in solid rock at side of tunnel insert charge then tamp fasten in with masonry must ensure destruction at point of explosion have hope of great damage being done by merely putting two barrel of nitroglycerine down upon line then firing can assure point mooted by doctor be more serious a far a see at present must hing in hour must in way ensure destruction of tunnel to make such chamber a speak of to hold two barrel of nitroglycerine must be work of four five day working night day even with aid of powder of course must be out of question to hope for a many hour there be pause of consternation a lieutenant ribouville spoke here be end of grand scheme from have expected so much at time german have other line of rail at command destruction of tunnel must have be disaster equal to of loss of pitched battle there must be chance must there of hiding in wood under tunnel run so a to bore down to blow in from above major tempe asked none whatever depth to be bored must be considerable stone be hard must not be pierced without use of powder must betray presence even must use be men good miner must be work of month at very least there be silence for minute then commandant said can not give up without trial think over ribouville for next three four day may be able to pitch upon plan if can not do so must at least try experiment of exploding nitroglycerine in middle of tunnel at rate a far in a can carry make retreat in half hour be time can calculate upon holding entrance chapter baffled project before leaving headquarters of commandant young barclays asked if wished that must continue to keep silence upon subject of expedition commandant replied that did not see that must do harm provided that impressed upon comrade necessity of maintaining absolute silence upon subject when of people of neighborhood be present although villager might appear to understand language german might yet know enough french to glean what be said if traitorously inclined to warn german thus enormously increase danger when barclays must again go down to town cousin have already heard of return for boy upon sitting down to dinner at commandant have requested leave to send line to cousin who must be anxiously expecting hallo barclay where have be to day be general exclamation a entered on duty ralph said on duty yes what duty duburgs have be mysterious must say nothing sergeant here knew nothing about except lieutenant told that have leave irish tim have be hanging about day a restless a cow have lost calf have be down to saverne ralph said there be general exclamation of astonishment of men who have already lain down upon straw for night sat up again crowded round to hear ralph story at once told at length when finished gave rise here a have done at officer table to animated discussion several of men shook hand warmly with barclays congratulating on offer to undertake dangerous service upon valuable though unfavorable information have obtained from time forward men ceased to attempt to pas joke at expense of of boy when corp be first raised many of young men have be inclined to protest against boy being accepted when list must have be readily filled with men by time boy have proved that be quite a capable of supporting fatigue a be men have behaved equally well in action now enterprise of barclays testified to fact that in dangerous expedition requiring coolness presence of mind nerve be equally to be relied upon henceforward there be distinction difference between various member of corp four day passed a ex officer of engineer must suggest certain plan for destruction of tunnel must be carried out in time surprise of sentry at mouth must give major tempe resolved upon delaying no longer on sending four men into tunnel under lieutenant ribouville with instruction to go a far a must in quarter of hour to set down barrel against rock to light fuse cut to burn quarter of hour then to return at full speed to mouth of tunnel one company be to seize other end to tear up seven eight ten rail to retire at once into wood a delay in getting rail into place again must prevent train entering from end in time for occupant to see extinguish burning fuse other company be absent be to join headquarters evening before attempt be hoped that three company must be able to keep enemy at bay for hour so a to give time to party with nitroglycerine to take to required position rejoin comrade immediately upon doing so retreat be to commence a enemy must not possibly penetrate tunnel extinguish fuse before explosion took place attempt be not to be made till following evening in order that barclays might go down see that be a before at saverne along line next day accordingly boy again put on disguise started a before taking precaution to change in wood so a not to be seen by of villager upon reaching spot from view of tunnel be obtainable stopped with simultaneous exclamation of dismay not only be two sentry stationed near entrance fifteen twenty german soldier be sitting standing by small building at short distance have evidently be turned into guard house look very much against ralph one must think that have got information of being near look bad indeed percy let go on into town will perhaps learn something about there sharp walk soon brought to saverne sentry be on duty at entrance to town several of comrade stood near sentry looked a if about to stop seeing when came up that be only boy let pas without question worse worse percy something be up sure enough became more evident at step took for little town be absolutely crowded with german soldier unless be merely halting here upon march through be up with plan percy there must be over two thousand men here at very least upon questioning lad of town of about own age found that fresh troop have arrived upon preceding day infantry two thousand strong coming in by train late in evening before three hundred cavalry marched in only hour before boy arrival be quartered upon inhabitant there appeared to be sign of early departure for time boy walked about without obtaining information although entered dozen cabaret drank considerable quantity of beer at last before one of principal cafe saw ten twelve german officer sitting talking none of inhabitant be sitting at cafe boy dared not go in to ask for anything there a must not have be in accordance with appearance how be to get within hearing percy look here ralph will limp along a if have something in shoe hurt then will sit down on doorstep close to take off boot can sit down too take of bread cheese put in pocket because must not eat at last place went in will keep boot off to ease foot can eat bread cheese a slowly a like will do capitally percy in couple of minute two lad be sitting a agreed upon step of door close to cafe must not hear be said must catch sense a german officer a be custom spoke in very loud voice belonged to infantry be appeared in ignorance of reason of sudden move to saverne presently captain of cavalry came along street ah von rausen major in infantry exclaimed be here have not seen since day marched from coblentz indeed major other said saluting a prussian officer always doe to superior in rank other

village german infantry halted at distance of two hundred yard must have lost too many men in crossing open to make worth while to attack sheltered foe who must pick off to last moment only to withdraw deeper into forest when approached edge accordingly too fell back exchanging fire with franc tireurs until gained shelter of village conflict over men sank exhausted upon ground where stood major tempe went round to saying word of praise giving little of brandy with have filled canteen before starting with water from own keg then gave sharp whistle men again gathered round once more lad

cavalry at lowest estimate altogether although forced to fall back affair be more creditable than many brilliant victory own loss have be heavy a heavy in proportion to number a of enemy though owing to advantage of position while engaged with infantry be actually far le than theirs still lad be very very heavy major looked round with saddened face on diminished band only consolation be that

must not have lifted carried off tim saved life there be doubt about that a be evident that philippe be too weak to talk must be better for being quiet awhile boy now left with brother looking through tree towards village dense smoke must now be seen rising in several place in few minute whole village be in blaze moved by sight unfortunate inhabitant came out from hiding place in forest wringing hand cry cursing invader in spite of advice of major tempe several of woman went off towards scene of conflagration to endeavor to save little household treasure from flame in short time one of returned to fetch husband saying that enemy have left before reached village be already far down hillside major tempe at once sent forward unwounded men to assist villager to put out fire to save property effort be however altogether unavailing german have scattered large quantity of petroleum before leaving upon bed such other furniture a must not carry away destroy be pitiable sight to see poor homeless people sitting about looking at ruin of house cried piteously others gazed with listless face with cold despair even more painful to see fortunately have saved animal at present be too much absorbed in thought of what have lost to bestow even thought of satisfaction on what have saved major tempe grieved touched at painful scene of men have be cause called franc tireurs together made proposition to be at once heartily agreed to then called together cure schoolmaster after few well chosen word of regret at ill have involuntarily brought upon village handed over to in name of whole corp hundred pound in thaler note have be found upon schoolmaster whom have executed for treachery to be distributed among inhabitant according to necessity offer be gratefully received priest schoolmaster at once went round told poor people whose gratitude delight be unbounded to so poor population sum seemed immense although must not replace what be destroyed must go far towards making abode habitable village only contained about twenty house wall be still standing timber for roof floor be to be have for cutting in forest bush for thatching must be found in abundance principal portion of house therefore must cost only labor money must suffice to keep alive while engaged upon enough must remain to get at least few blanket to lay upon straw must for time serve for bed together with few other simple necessary sale of portion of animal must do rest in gratitude to franc tireurs for having thus relieved first most pressing difficulty inhabitant altogether forgot ill feeling have before felt against a author of disaster after burying dead men set to work to assist villager in building temporary hut rather bower to edge of forest in before nightfall have satisfaction of seeing installed few article of bedding blanket etc saved at approach of prussian be spread on heap of freshly cut grass one of ox of franc tireurs have arrived day before be killed

be sent for arrived wounded be placed in upon heap of straw sent off with one of surgeon with instruction to travel among hill until reached point where must be quite safe to descend into valley take train to dijon at first station at be open among be philippe duburg who be accompanied by brother louis have obtained week leave of absence for purpose be bearer of letter innumerable message from boy to parent sister few hour later remnant of first second company marched to join comrade chapter bridge of vesouze very day after fight news arrived induced sudden change of position upon sixteenth of september baden troop occupied mulhouse having entered colmar on preceding day be evident that railway be so strongly guarded between strasburg nancy that be hopeless to expect to be able to interrupt seriously with so small force a at major tempe command still le possible be to render assistance to doomed city of strasburg after taking counsel therefore with officer major tempe decided to march more to south so a to assist to oppose passage of enemy west from colmar mulhouse through pass of vosges alarm be however temporary for having made requisition a usual prussian retired corp returned to old quarter there ten day passed spent not in ease in constant marching counter marching whenever news arrived that party of uhlans be approaching mountain with object of making requisition corp be instantly set in motion sometimes severe skirmish be result sometimes news turned out to be untrue after long day march night spent watching men have nothing to do to march back again upon th came news of surrender of strasburg upon preceding day after one of most heroic defense in history there be now doubt that german must ere long advance seriously by time total of french force among vosges mountain be considerable scarce day passed without arrival of corp of franc tireurs have corp be animated with spirit such a evinced by franc tireurs of dijon have acted in unity with discipline intelligence might have rendered immense service to france unfortunately be very far from being case very many of men have entered rank only to avoid being called upon to go out with mobile mobilized national guard others have only entered from impulse of moment very many be altogether unwilling to submit to steady discipline while in great number of case corp be completely paralyzed from utter incapacity of officer owing to various cause corp of franc tireurs distinguished in great number of case only by extreme ingenuity foresight displayed in keeping at prudent distance from enemy too earned bad name not only for for whole body of franc tireurs by conduct towards villager helping freely to what required making almost a much dreaded by peasantry a even german at same time villager have in very many case only to blame for rough measure adopted by franc tireurs for often instead of doing in power for men who have taken up arm in cause of france villager looked upon only a stranger out of whom richest possible harvest be to be obtained charged most exorbitant price for article of necessity supplied to in fact sometimes did not hesitate to say that must not provide at price with provision required a must be wanted to satisfy requisition of german upon arrival perhaps in whole world there be class of people so completely engrossed by thought of gain a be french bourgeois rustic population change of government political alteration law passed be regarded by simply solely from view of how will affect own pocket thus instead of driving away flock herd at approach of invader people remained quietly in house shamelessly trafficked with invader apathy faint heartedness want of patriotism upon part of inhabitant of small town village caused innumerable difficulty to franc tireurs major tempe be sometimes obliged to take law into own hand when villager absolutely refused to sell provision to give quarter to men in case summoned priest schoolmaster two other head men of place formed committee with own officer fixed fair price upon article required major tempe then sent round notice to effect that if article be furnished in two hour must be paid for at agreed rate that if not furnished must quarter men upon inhabitant in accordance with size of house must remain there at least week threat never failed in producing required effect be seldom however that major encountered difficulty of sort corp be for most part composed of men with money have now too sold sheep cattle have captured at blamont finding inconvenience of sending for whenever meat be required proceeds of of horse captured at same time have given good sum in regimental chest be therefore able willing to pay fair price for such article a required besides report of action of blamont still have now widely circulated a general thing people be glad to do in power for corp composed of men who really meant work have given good proof of courage energy by time boy have received several letter from home may be readily imagined pleasure letter afforded major tempe official report of doings of corp have be published in dijon paper from have be copied far wide through france people of dijon be not little proud of corp name of two barclays have appeared in report a specially distinguishing father have written saying how pleased gratified be at conduct mr barclay milly have also written expression of pleasure be mingled with many hope that boy must not expose unnecessarily band have dwindled much in month since left dijon upwards of thirty have be killed disabled in fight of blamont still half a many more have be killed wounded in smaller skirmish ten twelve have gone home into hospital completely knocked up with hard work exposure only about sixty men therefore remained schlestadt neu brisach be now invested by german after waiting for few day to ascertain course that be likely to take major tempe determined a general cambriels be forming army down by besancon to defend upper pass of vosges a be rumored that second german army be likely to advance south from nancy that must recross vosges aid in defense against second army of invader three day fatiguing march brought to epinal where boy in accordance with promise went straight to house of gentleman who have so hospitably served at last visit friend be delighted to see expressed great regret that one of party be missing boy be however able to say that last letter from dijon have given good account of philippe duburg who be now considered out of danger there be however hope of being able to rejoin a surgeon considered probable that leg must be very long time before must be sufficiently healed to allow to use host have read account in paper of doings of franc tireurs wife laughingly made further apology to barclays cousin for remark at first visit about boy girl have talked about nothing else doings ever since have news of attack upon uhlans near blamont said one must think from interest take in corp that whole future of france depended upon franc tireurs of dijon young barclays laughed percy muttered something under breath while louis duburg replied seriously that hoped franc tireurs of dijon must always do best to deserve kind thought of mademoiselle at piece of politeness percy muttered bosh epinal have a yet escaped be feared that ere long enemy must advance town looked deserted for young men have left with mobile mobilized national guard men under forty be drilling in readiness to march at moment notice no serious movement of enemy south of luneville be a yet signalized after two day rest corp again marched destination being kept profound secret even from men so anxious apparently be major tempe that time object must not be foiled by treachery that after first day march left main road having secured service of peasant a guide made two long day march through forest over mountain avoiding even small village four led horse accompanied march one laden with gun cotton other three carrying provision so that might be independent of local supply night bivouacked in forest a weather be now fine although night be cold be hardship upon morning of fourth

forest of moudan within three mile of railway between luneville rechicourt on line to strasburg intention be to reconnoiter day if success must be found possible to attempt at daybreak next morning to blow up railway bridge over vesouze news be received with great satisfaction a corp be burning to distinguish in way must do such service a to cut line of communication although a german be no longer dependent upon single line advantage must not be of so signal nature a must have be must have cut at time when first made attempt barclays be naturally selected to reconnoiter a change of clothes have be always by major tempe order carried on baggage horse have difficulty upon score expedition be uneventful at village nearest to bridge went in bought cheese other article after gaining information be able without exciting attention made way through broken ground to point near enough to bridge to enable to reconnoiter undiscovered sentry be posted at end at cottage hard by be ten others while

ribouville now set to work to inspect bridge ordered men who be provided with necessary implement to set to dig hole down to crown of principal arch be harder work than have expected roadway be solid ballast pressed down very tightly crown of arch covered to considerable depth with concrete only few men must work at once after half hour desperate labor hole be nothing like far enough advanced to ensure total destruction of bridge upon charge being fired in meantime prussian sentry be arriving from up down line although not in sufficient force to attack have opened fire from distance think will do ribouville major tempe asked sir other replied might blow hole through top of arch hardly think that must do so force must be spent upwards at moment ralph who have done spell of work have be down to stream to get drink of water came running up if please lieutenant ribouville there be hole right through pier just above water edge seems to have be left to let water get into pier from above make escape must think must do to hold charge very thing lieutenant ribouville said delightedly what fool be not to have looked to see if such hole existed stop work men carry barrel down to edge of water stream be not above waist deep engineer officer immediately waded into examined hole at once pronounced to be admirably suited to purpose did not a ralph have supposed go straight through there be two hole one upon side of pier nearly at same level extending into center of pier hole be about four inch square barrel of gun cotton be now hastily opened on bank men waded out with content

tireurs sheltered behind parapet of bridge on bank of river be exchanging lively fire with enemy three quarter of hour have passed since first shot be fired suddenly distant boom be heard followed in few second by slight whizzing noise grew rapidly into loud scream in moment there be explosion close to bridge men left off work for instant what may be mister percy more unpleasant sound niver heard since be baby quite agree with tim a to unpleasantness be shell artillery be coming up from luneville fire of sentry must take alarm in couple of minute give fifteen to get ready hour to get within

german artilleryman have apparently arrived at same conclusion for now ceased to fire retreating corp be only exposed to occasional shot from infantry who have followed from bridge artillery cavalry will be up before reach wood percy said to brother a trotted along side by side may come up ralph said can do harm on broken ground will catch tartar if mind ground be indeed unfavorable for cavalry artillery be broken up with spur of hill here there great mass of rock cropped out of ground while patch of forest extended over considerable portion of ground in one of standing upon rising broken ground major tempe halted men opened so heavy fire upon enemy cavalry when column appeared that be at once halted although when artillery arrived few shell be fired into wood franc tireurs have already retired gained forest without further molestation upon calling roll be discovered that six men only be missing have fallen either killed wounded from fire of enemy infantry during time that operation at bridge be being carried out there be great rejoicing at success of enterprise effect of must certainly be to block traffic along line for at least week satisfaction be however somewhat damped by sight of several dense column of smoke in plain showing that german have a usual wreaked vengeance upon innocent villager feeling of disgust be changed to fury when of peasant who have fled into wood upon destruction of abode reported that german having found that three of franc tireurs be only wounded have dragged along to entrance to village have hung there upon tree by roadside have

tireurs in village mile back ralph now rode carefully forward while peasant went back into hiding place by wood a have said gorge widened into broad valley few hundred yard farther on upon emerging from gorge ralph at once saw village almost hidden among tree at distance of le than quarter of mile after what have heard dared not ride on farther therefore drew horse aside from road among tree dismounted made way carefully up rocky side of hill to point from must command view down whole valley when gained spot looked cautiously round below beyond village must see large number of men must make out line of cavalry horse row of artillery considerable movement be going on ralph have doubt that be about to advance in interest in what saw probably exposed figure somewhat caught eye of sharp sighted sentry in village first intimation of danger be given by seeing twenty uhlans dart suddenly out of tree in village lay at top of speed while almost at same moment eight ten rifle flashed ball whizzed round in most unpleasant propinquity ralph turned in instant bounded down rock with speed recklessness of at other moment must have be incapable fierce a be pace at uhlans be galloping be still hundred yard distant when ralph leaped upon horse galloped out in front of there be rapid discharge of carbine men at full gallop make poor shooting ralph felt be untouched by convulsive spring horse gave knew animal be wounded for couple of hundred yard there be little difference in speed then ralph to dismay felt flag knew that wound have be severe one hundred yard animal staggered must have fallen have not ralph held up well with knee bridle uhlans saw for gave shout pistol bullet whizzed close to head ralph looked round officer twenty yard ahead of men be only about forty yard in rear in hand held revolver have just discharged surrender shouted be dead man ralph saw that pursuer be too close to enable to carry out intention of dismounting taking to wood here began to approach thickly close to road be on point of throwing up arm in token of surrender when horse fell heavily with at moment when prussian again fired almost simultaneously with crack of pistol came report of gun german officer fell off horse shot through heart ralph leaped to foot dashed up bank in among tree just a shot be fired with like fatal result into advancing uhlans rest believing that have fallen into ambush instantly turned horse head galloped back road have come ralph first impulse be to rush down into road catch officer horse have galloped on short distance when master fell be now returning to follow companion a did so old peasant appeared from wood thank ralph said warmly have saved life at rate have saved from german prison peasant paid attention to stooped down to examine carefully whether german be dead two more said with grim smile make fifteen three apiece then picked up officer revolver took cartridge belonging to from pouch with wave of hand to ralph strode back into wood ralph removed holster from saddle of own horse have fallen dead placed on horse of german officer then mounting rode off at full speed to inform general cambriels of result of investigation hallo barclay one of fellow officer said a rode up to headquarters have be up to doing little barter with german hussar seem to have got best of too for own horse be good one be good deal better unless be mistaken how have come about quite crowd of idler have collected round while officer be speaking struck like with singularity of sight of french staff officer upon horse with german trapping ralph did not wish to enter into explanation there so merely replied in same jesting strain that have be fair exchange small difference in value of horse being paid for with small piece of lead then throwing rein to orderly who came running up went in to report to general evident forward movement of german be a strong a have heard general asked fully must say sir have mean of judging infantry seemed in large force be certainly strong in cavalry saw eight ten battery of artillery let next for duty ride with speed to tempe tell to hold upper end of valley send herve battery forward to assist have general assembly sounded ralph left to obey order while general gave colonel of staff instruction for disposition of force army of vosges pompous a be name consisted at time of only ten thousand men

only in gray trouser with red stripe form part of mobile uniform in blue blouse great number of be almost shoeless having be taken straight from plow workshop having received shoe since joined half disciplined half armed clothed be too evidently match for german fact be patent to general officer still instruction be to make stand at hazard in vosges now prepared to obey order not hoping for victory trusting in natural courage of men to enable to draw off without serious disaster greatest weakness be artillery of have only two battery against eight ten of german whose force be even numerically superior to own in hour disposition be made valley be wide at point there be five six village nestled in be pretty thickly wooded two mile behind narrowed again considerably just a troop have gained appointed place faint sound of heavy musketry fire be heard in gorge ahead mingled in few minute with deep boom of cannon general surrounded by staff moved forward towards spot from road at entrance to narrow part of valley nothing must be seen cracking of rifle among tree rock on side bursting of shell whistling of bullet be incessant general staff accordingly dismounted handed horse to men of escort mounted side of hill after sharp climb reached point from whence must see right down long narrow valley on beyond tree except near road be thin steep side of hill being covered with great block of stone thick brushwood among down one side up other at distance of five hundred yard from post taken up by general succession of quick puff of smoke told where colonel tempe franc tireurs be placed while among tree below there came up great wreath of smoke from battery be supporting by firing at german formed long line up down side of valley at three four hundred yard distance from french line two german battery be down in road few hundred yard to rear of skirmisher be sending shell thickly up among rock where franc tireurs be lying hid while two other battery german have managed to put short way up on mountain side still farther in rear be raining shell with deadly precision upon french battery in road prettier piece of warfare must have be difficult to imagine lofty mountain side long line of little puff of smoke among brushwood rock white smoke arising from tree in bottom quick dull burst of shell a spectacle be most striking noise be prodigious steep side of mountain echoed report of gun into prolonged roar like rumble of thunder rattle of musketry never ceased for instant loud distinct above din rose menacing scream of shell be grand indeed ralph percy said after moment silence splendid ralph said be evident can not hold gorge skirmisher be three to one shell must be doing terrible damage barclay general cambriels said go down to battery bring back word how be getting on scene quite lost beauty to percy now a saw ralph scramble rapidly down hillside in direction of tree among french battery be placed over among shell be bursting second seemed

enemy shot shell horse have be killed under have not received even scratch now mounted upon horse of one of officer who be killed be returning from carrying order across very open piece of ground at full gallop suddenly came upon sight hurried a be exposed a be position caused instantly to draw rein come to full stop illustration child on battlefield there in open field be two child one boy of

ditch percy went on again at full gallop french be now being driven back towards point where valley narrowed again many of mobile be in full flight general cambriels therefore withdrew artillery to point where must cover movement then ordered rapid retreat ten regiment of line zouaves acting a rear guard be already getting dark movement be carried out with slight loss german contented with success attempted movement in pursuit chapter surprise after check in vosges general cambriels found impossible to restore sufficient order among mobile to enable to show face again to enemy be besides in want of many article of urgent necessity force be shoeless thin blouse be a have be said covering that many of mobile have be ill calculated to resist bitter cold be already setting in ammunition too a well a food be short general determined therefore upon falling back upon besancon reorganizing force there wound in head too be insufficiently healed when took command have now broken out again surgeon ordered absolute repose for while upon day of fight ralph have ridden slowly to rear when saw that fight be going against french hardened a be by work with excellent constitution wound never for moment assumed troublesome aspect at end of week be able keeping of course in sling to mount horse report ready for duty headquarters be now at besancon ralph must have applied for have obtained leave to go to dijon have not done so a have be so lately at home thought that sight of arm in sling must be likely to make mother more nervous anxious on account than before german be still at distance from besancon being watched by colonel tempe franc tireurs by irregular force considerable army be now fast gathering at besancon regimental superior staff officer be hard at work at organization a aide de camp boy have little to do therefore requested leave for two three day to go up to old friend franc tireurs of dijon general at once granted required permission adding with smile forget be officer now lad get into hare brained adventure know be sure be back on thursday a expect general michel successor to arrive on friday will have to give a part of belonging be sure to be back general so set off taking a usual tim doyle with a orderly servant faith be glad enough to be out in open again mister ralph tim said a left besancon behind after living out in wood for six week there doe not seem room to breathe in crowded town be jolly to be out again tim know that mind town again for few day ah be very well for like of yees mister ralph with officer uniform arm in sling girl looking at a hero for be different entirely out in open feel except when there be anything to do for honor be own master can plase here in town be common hussar arm be just weary with saluting to fellow with sword by side that meet in street then there be chance of fighting a long a be shut up in wall of town what be use of being decked up in uniform except to fight be there chance of just least scrimmage in world while be back again with boy asked persuasively boy laughed not much tim will be pretty close to enemy something may turn up at moment surely have have enough in last six week pretty well mister percy pretty well see last affair did count oh did count ralph said looking at arm think counted for two three fight if be not hit be sure be fired at often enough to satisfy most desperate lover of fighting tim be fired at often enough daresay mister ralph ca say that liked entirely be so mighty pleasant sitting like stiff statue behind general with shell falling about like pea not allowed divarshin of single shot back in return away say hard a like let shoot back in return ' boy laughed day passed pleasantly a rode talked dusk have already fallen when reached party of franc tireurs be not own corp must officer in command tell exactly where must find be scattered over considerable extent of country said colonel alone must tell how be placed expect that will be here tonight best plan will be to stay here till come have not much to offer such a be be at service after moment consultation boy agreed to accept offer a have palpably more chance of meeting colonel tempe there than in journey through wood at night in ten minute horse be tied to tree be sitting by blazing fire with officer of franc tireurs village consisted of only three four house a there be fifty men in party upon have come bivouacked under tree hard by how far off be german ralph asked when dinner be over lay by fire smoking cigar ten mile so officer answered carelessly chance of coming way hope ralph laughed be very nearly caught near saverne once so heard officer said be rather skeptical a to night surprise in nine case out of ten mind mean for moment that be so in case in nine case out of ten rumor of night attack be moonshine perhaps so ralph said little gravely for have already noticed that discipline be very different among men than to have be accustomed among franc tireurs of dijon perhaps so can hardly be too careful how do like colonel tempe colonel must be excellent fellow be not colonel officer laughed be most unconscionable man for ever marching drilling disciplining if have way must make like regiment of line a if there must be good in carrying out sort of thing with franc tireurs have about half of together for three four day give word be a bad a slavery drill drill drill from morning till night be heartily glad can tell when got away with detachment ralph saw that new acquaintance be one of innumerable class who conceived drill discipline be absurdity that be only necessary for frenchman to shoulder gun for to be soldier so easily avoided argument by turning subject for couple of hour chatted then a fire be burning low men have already laid down to sleep ralph suggested that must do same will walk round sentry first with if like said sentry other said with laugh there be sentry pointed to man standing ten pace off leaning against tree men have marched day only came in hour before did be not going to waste strength by putting half of out to watch forest be advocate for harassing men good night then ralph said briefly wrapped in cloak lay down be not accustomed to sort of thing percy whispered to brother in english like wonder franc tireurs do so badly if be sample of discipline like ralph prussian be advancing if fellow last heard of a ten mile off be a likely a not to be only two sha be sorry when morning come percy however here be have authority over fellow so must make best of hope that for once folly will not have just reward so saying boy remained silent for night although silent neither of slept much ralph especially whose arm be still very sore at time painful hardly closed eye told be absurd must not help listening with painful attention have night be quiet one need not have strained ear for a knew from many hour have passed at night upon guard hush be so intense in great forest that one can hear fall of mountain stream mile away snapping of twig almost falling of leaf will catch ear night however be windy rustle of pine forest must have deadened sound except anything sharp near sentry did not appear similarly impressed with necessity for extraordinary attention be principally occupied in struggling against cold drowsiness walked up down stamped foot hummed snatch of song yawned with great vigor so managed to keep awake for two hour when roused next for duty lay down with grunt of relief at last after keeping awake for hour ralph dozed off how long slept knew not be roused into full wakefulness by touch on shoulder by hearing tim doyle whisper hist mister ralph have doubt that there be something wrong must sleep in camp without watch outpost for last quarter of hour fancy have be hearing noise know way be coming seems to be round may be wrong sir a sure a piper hush tim ralph said to irishman who have crawled noiselessly along have lain down by side percy be awake yes woke at tim whisper listen did listen distinctly above sighing of wind must hear rustling cracking noise day be just breaking light be not sufficiently strong to show object with distinctness among tree by jove be surrounded percy said be just going to alarm camp when sentry startled into wakefulness challenged fired franc tireurs woke leaped to foot percy tim be about to do same when ralph held down lie still said for life word be not out of lip when tremendous volley rang out round franc tireurs fell now ralph said leaping up make rush for house to house of shouted loudly be only chance will be shot down here like sheep officer of franc tireurs have already atoned for carelessness by life men obeyed ralph call amidst heavy fire rushed across fifty yard of open space to house door be burst in with rush ralph have not stopped at first house followed by brother tim doyle have run farther on entered last house in village why did not go in with others ralph have chance of defending here have only revolver have chance of defending anywhere percy ralph said there must be couple of hundred of at least not above fifteen twenty at most of franc tireurs gained house resistance be utterly useless yet have be with poor fellow must not have told to surrender when must probably be shot five minute afterwards must be simply throwing away life without doing least good there be heavy firing now heard moment after dozen shot be fired through window then there be rush of soldier towards door ralph have purposely left open surrender ralph shouted in german coming forward to meet be french officer fire voice said then young officer came forward be not franc tireurs asked for light be still insufficient to enable to distinguish uniform be officer of army upon general cambriels staff man be orderly here be sword surrender a prisoner of war german officer bowed keep sword for present gentleman be not in command at moment officer came up who have here von hersen why do make prisoner be two staff officer major hem said major doubtfully well if be officer continued order men to cease resistance franc tireurs most of whom have taken refuge in same cottage be still defending desperately be keeping up heavy fire from window will order to surrender at once ralph said quietly if give word that will be treated a prisoner of war will hing of sort sir german answered then will certainly not advise to surrender ralph said firmly have authority whatever over if give advice must be that must sell life a dearly a possible officer swore deep german oath strode off for five more minute fight continued round cottage many of german falling then rush be made there be fierce contest inside house shout shriek cry for mercy then be still young barclays tim be now told to sit down near tree at short distance off with two sentry with loaded rifle standing over german soldier took from house what few article fancied then set fire to sitting down eating breakfast a flame shot up at short distance from where barclays be sitting be group of eight ten franc tireurs six seven peasant guarded by soldier near german major two lieutenant be talking one of young men appeared to take little interest in conversation other be evidently urging point with great earnestness major be equally plainly refusing request for stamped foot angrily shook head what type that major be of brutal specie of german ralph said one used to meet sometimes officer be particularly nice fellow mere machine great brute apparently have specimen of of here officer passed near enough for barclays to catch what be saying young lieutenant be very pale for last time major implore for last time lieutenant von hersen major said brutally order to do duty by heaven if speak word will put in arrest young lieutenant turned silently away called up twenty men ordered to place franc tireurs peasant against wall be horrible ralph percy said that scoundrel be going to shoot in cold blood protest against execution ralph said in loud tone advancing towards major a cold blooded murder violation of right of war hold tongue sir german major said turning to furiously by heaven will put up there too dare not ralph said firmly outrage a do law of civilization humanity dare not officer of army in cold blood major turned black with passion by heaven exclaimed officer who have not hitherto interposed threw before pardon major said respectfully frenchman be right must bring discredit upon whole army to touch prisoner of war in other matter have nothing to say order have be published that franc tireurs peasant sheltering will be shot be not for to discus order to obey be matter affecting honor major stood for moment irresolute knew well that german military authority must punish probably with death atrocity meditated said hoarsely to of men near tie arm behind back take farther into wood ralph brother tim doyle be hurried into wood by guard strict a be discipline of german army must see that disapproved in highest degree of conduct of commanding officer be still near enough to see what be passing in village not man of franc tireurs begged life stood upright against wall two of peasant imitated example a did boy of not over thirteen year of age two other lad of same age peasant fell on knee prayed piteously for life young officer turned round towards major in one now mute appeal be in vain put rifle within foot of head lieutenant said fire when smoke cleared away soldier be standing alone peasant franc tireurs lay in confused mass on ground lieutenant walked up to major with steady step with face a pale a ash have done duty major kolbach order be obeyed then without word drew out revolver put rapidly to temple blew out brain historical fact brutal a major kolbach be started back in horror a young lieutenant fell dead at foot while cry of surprise consternation broke from men major did not say word turned away paced up down with disturbed step while other lieutenant bent over body of comrade seeing that be dead in hushed voice ordered men who have run up to dig grave under tree bring there when be done ordered men to fall in placing barclays tim in midst then went up to major saluted saying coldly that men be ready to march major nodded signed to orderly who be holding horse to approach vaulted into saddle rode along road back toward main body of army lieutenant gave word column marched off leaving behind still smoking house still warm body of sixty men there be general gloom over face of men one must suppose from air that be returning from successful expedition in have annihilated body of enemy fifty strong with loss of only five six of own men discipline be however too strict for word of blame even of comment to be spoken not sound be heard heavy measured tramp a troop marched back through forest major rode on moodily forty fifty yard ahead of main body have not gone mile before there be shot fired in wood close to road major gave start nearly fell from horse then recovered turned to ride back to column when there be shot fell off horse heavily to ground column have instinctively halted lieutenant gave word load shout of triumph be heard in wood thirty one then be still be old fellow who saved life ten day ago percy ralph said by jove much obliged to a be then do think that be more grateful now finding that shot be not repeated twenty thirty skirmisher be sent into wood returned in ten minute without finding trace of man who have shot major lieutenant now took command there be continuation of halt for ten minute while major be hastily buried by roadside rough cross being put up to mark spot deep cross cut made in two nearest tree so that even if cross be overthrown place of burial might be found afterwards if necessary then corp marched on again first use lieutenant made of authority even before giving direction for burial be to order cord of prisoner to be cut then corp continued march by brightened face of men must be seen easily enough how unpopular late commander have be that cherished slight animosity against slayer in short time struck up one of marching song prisoner a be barclays must not admire steady martial bearing of men a strode along making wood echo with deep chorus in three hour march reached village troop have left evening before to surprise franc tireurs having a ralph have learned from lieutenant in command received information from spy of arrival at village late at night having started at once under guidance here considerable german force be assembled prisoner be not unkindly treated tim doyle be of course separated from astonishment be expressed at youth be assumed that have be pupil at saint cyr polytechnic many of whom received commission owing to impossibility of finding officer for immense new levy several of officer came in to chat with a have be also engaged in fight ten day before there be many question to ask upon side boy learned that must be sent on next day must be marched to luneville sent thence by train be fine set of fellow ralph said when last visitor have left good officer unquestionably when be nice capital fellow ca make out why must be so brutal a soldier for be undoubtedly kindly race doubt percy said be thinking of other matter not paying much attention to brother do think have chance of making escape ralph oh will escape fast enough ralph answered confidently with knowledge of german looking so young there can be great difficulty about when once get to end of journey be use thinking about at present will be good deal too closely looked after only hope will send to mayence coblentz not to one of fortress at other end of germany mind must not give parole next day when be summoned to start found that there be fifty sixty other prisoner who have be brought in from other direction belonged to line regiment greater portion by far be mobile who in retreat of general cambriels have be cut off left behind after hiding in wood for day be being gradually found brought in barclays be only officer therefore took place at head of prisoner who formed four deep with escort of uhlans set off on march be four day march weather be cold clear barclays be little fatigued when marched into luneville greater part of prisoner be however in pitiable condition be so footsore that must hardly put one foot before other others tottered with fatigue men of escort frequently used flat of sword to compel to keep together a marched through street of people in street uncovered woman waved hand to pressed forward offered fruit bread in spite of order of escort be taken straight to railway station where be put into shed ralph percy have gained goodwill of sergeant in command of escort by manner in have aided by interpreting to rest of prisoner by doing best to cheer up take thing now asked to request officer in command at railway station to allow to walk about until train started on parole request be upon favorable report of sergeant granted at once be told that train must go off until next morning that might sleep in town if chose thanking officer for permission went out of station when tall big bearded german sergeant stopped before donner wetter exclaimed so here be again boy gave little start for recognized at once sergeant who have so closely questioned in cabaret upon night when have carried off hung schoolmaster ralph saw at once importance of conciliating man a report from of circumstance might render position most unpleasant one even in event of nothing worse coming of must almost ensure captivity in prison upon farther side of prussia instead of at one of frontier fortress ah sergeant how be said gaily be fate see to be made prisoner be very nearly taking now here be nice trick played sergeant said surlily with woodcutter lame brother sick sister cask of beer got nice reprimand over affair come sergeant ralph said laughing let bygone be bygone be fair in war know did not touch single hair of of men head wanted be schoolmaster must not do good to talk about now might do harm be quite bad enough for a be be nice boy be sergeant said with face relaxing into smile to think of being taken in by two lad like well did well monstrously well will say for never flinched eyelash so be officer after never suspected anything about till three hour afterwards when went to relieve sentry found lying there tied up like bundle must think even then what meant for have made attack be till morning that found that old schoolmaster have be fetched out of bed carried off on head of twenty men well be well done bear malice be right sergeant now come have jug of beer with know have one with before remember drank to health of king william if like will return

prisoner boy went into cabaret near drank glass of beer with sergeant then saying goodbye very heartily left went into town well pleased to have got so well out of scrape might have be very unpleasant one slept at hotel be down at station at appointed time be long journey thirty six hour to mayence boy be too pleased when saw line that train be following to have cared have be twice a far difficulty of escape from western fortress must have be immense whereas at mayence be comparatively close to frontier at mayence too position of prisoner be comfortable be allowed to live anywhere in town to take meal when chose be obliged twice day to answer at muster roll be not of course allowed to go outside fortification one drawback to position of french officer be utterly insufficient sum prussian government allowed for board lodging only forty five franc month be to say fifteen penny day be needle to say that officer who have nothing else to depend upon literally starved upon pittance be more inexcusable that french government allowed more than twice sum to german officer who be taken prisoner upon head however boy have discomfort have plenty of money in pocket for present us knew that must obtain further supply by writing home via switzerland be therefore unaffectedly glad when train came to stop at station of mayence order be given for to alight chapter escape first thing that barclays did after reporting be to settle in lodging very easy thing to find for town be crowded with troop prisoner however a be able to pay higher sum than great majority of french officer in position have very great difficulty in finding place to suit room be purposely taken in large house with staircase common to number of family living on different floor so that anyone going in out must be le likely to be noticed than in smaller house be also careful in choosing room so placed that must go in out of door on to staircase without being noticed by people with whom lodged ralph arm be now extremely painful long march having inflamed wound have therefore on reporting begged that surgeon might attend have also asked a great favor that servant hussar doyle might be allowed to remain with stating that in case must pay for lodging provide with food a prison in private soldier be confined be at time crowded request be complied with for next week ralph suffered greatly with arm have to keep room after that inflammation subsided in fortnight be able to dispense for first time since received wound with sling in meantime have made acquaintance of people with whom lodged who be very kind to wounded lodger whose heart completely won by being able to chat to in native tongue like one of family consisted of father who be away day at railway station where be clerk mother garrulous old woman daughter pretty blue eyed girl of about ralph age who assisted mother to wait upon have lover away a soldier in army besieging paris thought that might be wounded taken prisoner made very pitiful to young officer ralph barclay have for day be intending to sound a to willingness to aid when began one day have cleared away dinner be standing a often did talking with when lowered voice so a not to be overheard by mother in next room wonder try to get away lot of french officer have done so be just what be thinking of christine have only be waiting till arm be out of sling want to help how can help girl asked in first place can buy clothes must excite suspicion if be to buy percy be thinking of going a girl not pretty girl of course like christine great rough peasant girl christine

what be worse ralph will not be able to see five yard must have idea where be swimming have not thought of percy yes must be very serious ralph thought for time seems risk percy can see plan except to draw fire how do mean percy asked puzzled see percy idea before be to get down to shore to put dummy into water to let float down hundred yard length of string then to start holding other end of string in hope that if sentry be really sharply on lookout must see dummy instead of a will be much more conspicuous object especially a intended to do a much diving a must movement forward must jerk dummy string make bob like man swimming if once caught sight of must be too busy firing at to look about for anyone else well now think that instead of giving up dummy altogether a might have done now that snow have come on must let float gently down for seventy eighty yard then throw stone into water by so a to draw attention of sentry if sentry be pretty far apart one of might make great splash in water when dummy be floating then run back before sentry get up get into water quietly higher up fire will act a guide to have better start soon ralph may take hour even two to get down to water

lucky that be downhill percy must never find way to water edge if keep descending must be there at last before starting boy went few pace from other be pleased to find white costume suited admirably a between driving snow white sheet upon ground must not make other out at more than eight ten yard even when knew exactly where stood now began to descend hill very carefully step by step snow upon ground made walking much more easy than otherwise must have be footstep muffled alike by india rubber sol snow upon walked be inaudible even to have several wall to climb noiseless india rubber sol be of good service here several time must hear sentry beating foot upon ground to warm in case be near enough to see at last after hour half spent in passing three hundred yard separated from river reached in safety wall of road run along by river here sentry be pacing along at distance of thirty forty yard apart white house upon opposite side of road must be faintly seen boy moved along until opposite opening between by must get through to river looking over wall must watch sentry choosing time when one have just passed so that back must be turned towards sooner disappeared in darkness than dropped noiselessly into road ran across street climbed low railing stood in garden reached down to river stood watching for time to assure that sentry be placed in garden at last stole forward stood at end of garden with river at foot snow be at back be falling faster than ever river deepened rapidly from wall water be low enough for anyone to get along on sloping side faced with rough stone between foot of wall water boy got over wall took dummy from bag holding one end of cord put quietly into water allowed to float down about sixty yard now percy ralph said get ready to slip into water a quietly a possible moment hear splash will leave bag here so a to know exactly where have gone in a rope be plenty long enough keep hold of here at sixty yard from dummy will fasten slack end to stone so that when go in have only to hold rope in hand to be able to join will take heavy coping stone in hand will crawl along on shelving bank till arrive at dummy will then throw stone in run back at full speed be in water few second after be right ralph understand keep pistol cocked in hand a go ralph crept quietly along under wall until saw dummy floating at edge of water few foot below rose on foot to throw in stone when heard deep exclamation behind looking round saw dark figure within two foot of moment sentry must have brought rifle to shoulder for sprang back giving loud shout ralph wheeled round instantaneously threw up revolver fired at sentinel body saw fall turned round hurled heavy stone with loud splash into water then crawling low under wall ran at full speed back again a did so two sentry in garden over head fired in direction of splash in water shout be heard all along bank in instant ralph grasped line slid down snowy slope into water entering so quietly
