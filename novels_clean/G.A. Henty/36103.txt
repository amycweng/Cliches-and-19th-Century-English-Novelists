of thoughtlessness than of anything more serious trouble be that instead of going frankly to friend making clean breast of girl will try set matter right so in order to avoid little unpleasantness may ruin whole life dorothy eye opened more more widely a father went on 'yes father have heard of such thing know why be saying so to have never got into scrape that know of ' doe mean then said handing

that in country house where have be staying have got into foolish flirtation with one have be silly enough to correspond with will not suppose that man to whom must write must be blackguard enough to trade upon weakness letter may have fallen into one else hand valet perhaps who seeing engagement to lord halliburn now seek to extort money from by threatening to send letter to if so dear child

once have not remotest idea what that letter mean who wrote if be not that have name address on other side must not have have idea that be meant for except trifling note of invitation that sort of thing think have ever written to man until be engaged to algernon ' be relief mr hawtrey said more cheerfully than have before spoken 'it be pain to to think even for moment that must have be so foolish never entered head to think that must have done anything absolutely wrong however must now look at rascally letter from point of view here be man writing to demand sum of money for letter now be one of two thing have forged letter in possession for hope to extort money have letter of kind only intention in writing in manner on envelope be in way to cause pain annoyance may assume that

dismissed man whose request for money for one purpose may have refused anyone in short to whom may have given offence ' that know of father know last maid left to get married have nothing to do with

kind will be openly delivered peter can hardly have helped reading have evidently be written in large bold handwriting so that can be read at glance of course will speak to will probably have chatted about downstairs already will go down to scotland yard inform of annoyance ask advice there though see that can do anything until can furnish with sort of clue may find one later on envelope certainly give nothing to go on may be sure others will follow be dreadful father dorothy repeated a rose think that such malicious letter a can be sent that may be talked about among servant think there will be more coming here dear must imagine post office authority will have objection to retain if there must be difficulty about will have lock put on letter box keep key so that at least servant here will know nothing about be going out with cousin morning ' ' be going will make excuse now must not be chattering about sort of thing with 'that be just what must do dorothy have taken colour out of cheek child though suppose cold water rub with hard towel will bring back again at rate go about a if have something on mind may be sure that servant will be looking at curiously may say to peter if see be in way disturbed annoyed matter will soon pas out of mind on other hand if notice change will be saying to there must be something in ' a soon a daughter have left room mr hawtrey touched bell be going out peter if anyone call to see can say that will not be in till lunch time may be detained at scotland yard be going there to set police on track of fellow who sent that letter to miss hawtrey

that must be kept entirely in dark probably fellow be in communication with one in house acquainted with one of servant if hears nothing about may suppose letter have not attracted notice a intended must do will have more of will increase chance of finding ' ' have not mentioned anything about sir ' better peter must come bring in with other letter hand in to privately miss hawtrey be naturally greatly pained annoyed must not wish to know if more letter come 'it be hardly matter that can take up ' inspector at scotland yard said when mr hawtrey showed envelope explained matter suppose at bottom be attempt to extort money though one doe not see how writer intends to go about if there must be offer to drop annoyance on receipt of sum of money sent to post office shop to be called for must take up watch place arrest whoever come for letter at present there be nothing to go upon see that can do anything in matter if think worth while might put into private hand must cost good deal of money see that anyone must help much ' care what cost ' mr hawtrey said hotly 'can recommend of private detective inspector shook head 'there be trustworthy men among sir thorough rogue make point of never recommending anyone doubt own solicitor must be able to tell of good man to go to mr hawtrey hailed cab when went out told man to drive to essex street just a turned down from strand saw danvers turn out from approach to middle temple stopped cab jumped out ' be just going to lawyer ' said 'but dare say danvers can save loss of time generally mean at least hour waiting before be disengaged can tell of shrewd fellow who can be trusted to undertake difficult piece of business 'that be rather vague mr hawtrey danvers laughed ' might reply that man stand before ' 'no mean sort of detective business ' 'there be plenty of shrewd fellow who call private detective mr good many of be too shrewd altogether of course have be in contact with several of majority be rogue of first water still there be honest men among if knew little more what sort of work wanted done must be better able to tell what kind of man require for ' 'it be deucedly unpleasant business danvers will gladly tell what be for want advice of one like accustomed to deal with difficult case can spare ten minute pleasure have case on to day will come to chamber be not minute walk be on ground floor 'what do think of danvers mr hawtrey asked after have shown envelope related briefly interview with daughter ' know what to think of ' danvers said after pause 'knowing miss hawtrey a have pleasure of doing of course entertain doubt of truth of denial believe be a completely in dark a a to what thing mean must own that be not often must take young lady word so implicitly in such matter have seen still more heard from solicitor of so many astounding case of trouble girl have got into sometimes from thoughtlessness only sometimes be bound to confess from what seems to to be entire absence of moral perception scarcely anything in way must surprise 'that miss hawtrey must do anything absolutely wrong be to out of question though might from thoughtlessness when girl a put to have got into silly entanglement for such thing happen continually after line took up with can dismiss from mind a altogether out of question must look at matter entirely from point of view that be attempt to extort money be simply outcome of sheer malice attempt to give pain to cause extreme annoyance miss hawtrey be say wholly unaware of having at time given such offence to anyone a to convert into enemy of course there be people who be just a bitter over imaginary injury a over real one be more inclined to think that letter be result of malice than attempt to extort money ' see how money must be extorted by such letter a when there be foundation for threat 'quite so mr hawtrey one who wanted to blackmail young lady must proceed in so clumsy manner a must write to to begin with letter full of vague hint threat in hope that although be ignorant of occurrence in life must give hold upon own conscience might bring to remembrance act of past folly thoughtlessness with engagement just made must certainly shrink from having raked up for instance might have have foolish flirtation sentimental correspondence stolen meeting thing foolish in way criminal that at moment must not wish to be brought to ear of man to whom be engaged cleverly vaguely worded letter might then cause to believe that affair be known to writer must endeavour to hush up by paying sum in power 'having written two three letter of kind without success persecutor might then send envelope like to show that be thoroughly resolved to carry out threat unless agreed to term a first move can mean nothing person to whom be addressed knowing that have already be seen by postman servant perhaps by others must in case be driven to hand over to friend miss hawtrey have received preliminary letter therefore be clear to that be not attempt to extort money have nothing therefore to fall back upon idea of sheer malice have known so many case of wanton ingenious mischief making arising from such paltry insufficient cause can be surprised at nothing ' see how anyone must do infamous cruel thing a danvers without real cause for malice daughter be altogether unconscious of having enemy there be nothing for to go upon see how business of discovery be to be commenced present certainly seem to have clue to help letter be posted see in london be of use be from small country town rural district matter must be comparatively easy london be hopeless have doubt more letter of kind will come must say that although post mark may afford information postal authority might be able to help know whether stamp at district post office be identical be possible that there may be private mark on little peculiarity by post office people must be able to tell office at be posted 'but even must help little a letter be collected sent to central district office be there believe stamped at rate see use in employing man now mr hawtrey if get clue even smallest have fellow in mind eye who must think suit be at one time clerk with buller son gave up criminal part of business when eldest son who have charge of branch died man slippen be no longer wanted then set up on own account a sort of private detective have be employed in two three delicate case in have held brief be certainly very shrewd fellow 'it must be relief to to be doing something ' mr hawtrey said think must like to see man danvers be silent for minute think mr hawtrey ' said at last 'it must be better if be to entrust matter to will see without mentioning name state fact say that may be asked to undertake case later on fewer people know of affair better whisper will get about whisper must be more unpleasant than if whole story be told openly in court if like will send clerk over to place at once make appointment for to come round here afternoon if be going to be at home evening will look in tell what opinion of matter be whether have suggestion to offer if will not suit will meet to morrow at time may appoint ' 'this evening will do very well

into study that evening 'but answer until have made comfortable poured out glass of port light cigar for few minute wine be too good to be spoilt 'yes have seen danvers replied a followed instruction deliberately 'and what doe say ' see mr hawtrey have not advantage have of knowing lady naturally have seen good deal of seamy side of life upon stating case to said without moment hesitation of course thing be a plain a pikestaff mr danvers man have got hold of secret be holding compromising letter have tried to get to come to term hang back show teeth writes open message if have not happened to fall into father hand must no doubt have brought to knee at once bey assurance that be absolutely certain that lady in question be in entire ignorance of whole affair be a much in dark a

nothing to do with that investigation when be once undertaken must have to proceed say on line that author of communication be man woman having personal enmity against lady instigated by desire to annoy pain 'well sir said of course if employ in matter will be business to carry out according to instruction be afraid that be not likely anything will come of search 'but said there be nothing impossible improbable in fact that someone must have grudge against have just become engaged to be married 'that alters case altogether said quickly there may be other woman who want to marry man there may be one who may consider that will be left in lurch if marriage come off of might endeavour to make scandal to get up quarrel might cause engagement to be broken off if have mentioned about engagement before be first idea must have occurred to there be very few thing jealous woman will stick at case look more hopeful now when come to know man name ought very soon to be able to put finger on writer of letter if be woman at rate if there be other clue be one must take up first 'that brought interview to end paid couple of guinea for advice fully understood that might might not be called in on future occasion 'it be confounded nuisance ' mr hawtrey said thoughtfully 'be fellow really trustworthy danvers 'he can be trusted to keep matter to ' barrister said 'these men be engaged constantly in delicate business such a getting up divorce suit must ruin business altogether be to allow word to escape a to matter in hand at rate know enough about slippen to be able to answer for discretion however hope that there will be occasion to move in matter at of course will not do so unless there be repetition of annoyance have little hope there will not be danvers mr hawtrey groaned wrote that letter be certain to follow up effect be intended to produce must hardly count on being effected by single attack own that be afraid so too ' danvers agreed 'you will hope let know if be so ' 'that may be sure be afraid that now have taken trouble to aid in matter will have to go through with altogether be utterly out of line anything connected with poaching stealing fruit drunken assault experience a county magistrate enables to treat with something like confidence here be altogether at sea experience a barrister be of greatest benefit to what time do get to chamber in morning ' be almost always there by half past nine between hour half past ten be almost certain to find if come later clerk will be able to find in court unless be engaged in case being tried can always come out to ' ' have be wanting to see father ' miss hawtrey said a soon a latter returned home ' expect lord halliburn will be here soon after lunch cousin mary be going with to botanical have better tell about not ' 'that be difficult question to answer dorothy must be sorry to offer advice about know lord halliburn good deal better than do can best judge how will take matter like must certainly be told sooner later for even if there be repetition of before marriage there may be afterwards many men must laugh at whole thing never give moment thought while others although must not doubt assertion of woman be engaged to must still fret worry over amazingly ' ' be sure must not doubt for moment father must think that really might worry over ' 'that be rather opinion too dorothy still be clear that must be told either by however there be occasion to tell to day flower show be not place must choose for purpose even if have not mary daintree with will see if letter come not if doe must be told at once dorothy looked little relieved at necessity for telling lord halliburn being postponed for day be of use worrying over dear father said kindly 'it be annoyance there be denying be nothing to fret over a insinuation be pack of lie cloud will blow away before long ' next morning a soon a breakfast be over mr hawtrey drove to central post office where postal authority have promised day before must retain communication of kind described have be introduced to official in charge of department where complaint of stolen letter be investigated followed up have envelope for mr hawtrey that gentleman said when entered 'and have be more fortunate than expected for can tell where be posted be dropped into letter box at claymore street chelsea be grocer shop in tying up bundle man eye fell on struck at once a being attempt to annoy extort money have good sense to put into envelope send on here with line of explanation so a to leave option of detaining if thought fit ' be very pleased to hear ' mr hawtrey said 'it be great thing to know there be at least one point from can make start 'it be not much may assist must remember however that be scarcely likely that next letter will be posted at same office fellow of kind be generally pretty cautious next letter may come from part of london altogether have sent note to man at post office telling that did right in stopping letter that be to similarly detain others of same kind may be posted there will send on to men on round have be already ordered not to deliver letter of kind to send back here sincerely hope mr hawtrey that may succeed in getting hold of fellow if do be afraid will not be through department chance against detecting man posting thing of kind be almost infinite ' be just half past ten when mr hawtrey reached danvers chamber found that occupier have not yet gone to court 'there be of ' mr hawtrey said throwing letter down before ' got at central office ' be in same handwriting a on previous day agree to term letter will be sent to lord h ' post office people have discovered that letter be posted at receiving office at claymore street chelsea ' must be valuable mr hawtrey if there be probability of next being posted at same place must make arrangement to have boy placed inside by box so that must see letter a fell in then must only have to run out follow whoever have posted must probably require special order from postmaster general for dare say must get at rate can wait day two if next letter be posted there will try plan if be posted elsewhere will of course be useless mr hawtrey next drove to lord halliburn in park lane have come on very unpleasant business halliburn ' said must have told about yesterday thought better to let stand over for day especially a must not have opportunity of discussing with then laid two letter before told step have taken conjecture that danvers have formed on subject of sender lord halliburn be young man of about nine twenty somewhat prided on self possession although generally liked be regarded a danvers have told friend a somewhat of prig face expressed annoyance a heard story be certainly unpleasant ' said ' be of course perfectly sure that dorothy be in way to blame in matter can be only malicious attempt to annoy still admit be annoying thing of sort be sure to get about somehow be certain that everyone who know dorothy will see matter in same light a do who will conclude that there be something in probably enough ere long there will be mysterious paragraph in one of society paper altogether be certainly extremely annoying great thing be to find out who sent quite agree with can not be attempt to extort money have be so demand must have be sent under seal not in manner suppose have idea of anyone having special enmity against ' 'not slightest man who a told danvers consulted without mentioning name be of opinion that might be work of woman be intended to cause unpleasantness between dorothy of course in case might be more able to form idea a to writer than can be 'no indeed there be woman in case ' lord halliburn said have always be perfectly free from entanglement of kind have ever have anything like serious flirtation before met miss hawtrey indeed a know have be travelling abroad almost constantly since left college can assure on honour can not think of anyone who must have motive however slight for making mischief between of course must be out of question that mischief must be made out of such thing a be too contemptible for notice beyond fact that be naturally annoying will see dorothy afternoon will tell not to give matter thought at same time will be extremely glad if can put hand on sender of thing chapter iv mr hawtrey hope that clue have be obtained be speedily dissipated for next letter be posted in south of london one after at brompton be clear that man who sent did not confine to one particular office that must be useless to set watch on in claymore street chelsea edward hampton coming in afternoon relieved mind by telling what have happened 'it be comfort to talk over with one ned be police officer for time out in india think may be able to see way through business danvers have be very kind about so far nothing have come of suggestion indian police experience be not much to point have police district for year duty consisted principally in

agreed with that be simply piece of malice detective to whom danvers have spoken without mentioning name suggested that might be work of woman who have grudge against felt aggrieved at engagement mentioned to assured that so far a knew there be one who have complaint against that have never have entanglement of kind 'it be horribly annoying thing mr hawtrey be sure miss hawtrey must feel very much thought be not looking quite when met at dinner night before last still there must be way of getting to bottom of if be not work of enemy either of lord halliburn of daughter may be work of one who have enmity against one who be striking at through yours 'that be just possible ned beyond men have sentenced on bench know of anyone who must put out of way to annoy assuredly can not be work of lincolnshire rustic 'but have certainly one enemy who be just sort of man to conceive carry out such blackguard business a mean man who be impertinent to on racecourse whose history told that evening ' ' have not thought of yes suggestion be certainly probable one be evidently deeply impressed with sense of injury though heaven know did not have slightest ill feeling against be driven to do what did by own course especially by father earnest request that must not succeed there be doubt a to malice there can be a little a to unscrupulousness 'danvers be of opinion mr hawtrey that by tone manner when spoke to about payment of debt that have already done injury have distinct plan in head at time daughter be not engaged to lord halliburn idea may have be vague one until public notice of engagement met eye when may have said to be opportunity for taking revenge by annoying father daughter ' 'it be possible ned can hardly bring to think that son of old friend must be capable of such

hear more hampton moved away in crowd continued to keep marvel in sight in two three minute man separated from companion moved off course stood for minute two with hand in pocket meditating then mind be made up pushed way through crowd crossed course walked quickly towards one of entrance captain hampton followed closely be by mean surprised to see walk to station be evidently nervous about what have told ' said to 'and although can not tell what business with may be be determined to avoid better must have have great difficulty in keeping eye on in crowd later on now wo lose sight of again ' entering station man waited until train came up then took place in third class carriage hampton entered next compartment to great annoyance found on arriving at waterloo that marvel be not in carriage 'confound ' muttered angrily must have slipped out at one of other station without noticing must have be at vauxhall just a four men be pushing past to get out be nice sort of fellow to take up amateur detective business to hunt for man for nearly three week then when have found to lose again like will go across see danvers of course will have laugh against well ca help will take advice about be evidently not fit to manage by danvers have just returned from court when captain hampton reached chamber hampton where do spring from everyone have missed from accustomed haunt said have eloped with heiress others that be wanted for forgery met hawtreys last night at dinner asked after young lady quite seemed to take disappearance to heart more so think because have sent down servant

of course remember ' 'well struck that might be man who have sent letter have a hawtrey told in evening bitter grudge against dirty trick a be just sort of thing that disreputable broken down knave like might concoct to gratify malice ' 'you be right there wonder idea did not occur to well retract what said just now so far have told nothing to justify epithet bestowed on ' bey first idea hampton went on without noticing interruption that a have nothing particular to do must go down to of race near town where felt certain must find follow fellow back track to home then have intended to come to ask advice a to next step to be taken showed sagacity again hampton well what came of ' went for fortnight to racecourse near town asked after marvel from bookmaker of stamp seemed rather surprised at

there spotted man ' then related conversation have overheard manner in have allowed man to slip through finger danvers must not help laughing though too be vexed ' can quite understand missing at vauxhall hampton of course be easy to be wise after event must not have done for to have got in same compartment with at epsom look like third class passenger idea that be military swell who have be enquiring after must probably have occurred to if have got out at station two further on then taken place in carriage that idea must hardly have entered mind ' 'well result be have thrown away three week of leave in taking lot of trouble be nearer than be before ' much except that have learnt that man be engaged on different matter in intends to make money also that there be little probability of being met with again for time on racecourse of course business may be altogether unconnected with of hawtreys on other hand may be be afraid there be little clue left for to follow up getting out at

danvers looked at friend through half closed eye with gleam of quiet amusement indian sun doe not seem to have cooled enthusiasm of youth hampton used to throw then like young demon into middle of football scrimmage rowed stroke in four of yours till rowed crew to standstill then tugged away to yourself till got wind again to jaded men up man ' hampton said hotly 'this be joking matter here be honour happiness of girl who when be little child be very dear to ' danvers eye twinkled momentarily 'and must be brute if did not do everything must to put matter straight be quite sure ' went on

have got start hampton always have end of last will take fence well seems to there be likely to be awkward one besides be not half sure that other fellow will run straight when pinch come when captain hampton presented at house in chester square found to satisfaction that mr hawtrey daughter be at home 'they have just finished dinner sir ' servant said 'dessert be on table 'then will go in ' captain hampton said opening dining room door walked in ' be presuming on old footing to enter unceremoniously mr hawtrey said ' be glad to see be heartily welcome ned reminds one of old time indeed '

to work know exactly person to whom to apply have agent under who know infinitely better sort of place where fellow must be likely to take up quarter than can do 'no doubt be so ' captain hampton admitted reluctantly must have liked to have run down now have hunted so long still be matter of importance great thing be to lose time will get danvers to give note to man spoke to first ' behalf

be sir ' far a can see captain hampton went on view be correct certainly first be not have a think laid finger on writer who be man who belief to have personal grievance against mr hawtrey ' then related whole story may be man mr slippen said when have finished 'at rate there be something to go on there be not before there will be no great difficulty in laying one hand on at present have not

will come out awful good night sir 'good night lad tell mr slippen when see that will probably be round to morrow next day on following morning captain hampton called early at chester square mr hawtrey dorothy have just finished breakfast mr daintree a be custom after being out late night before have taken hers in bed have good news so far have discovered rather slippen have where truscott be to be found frequents public house called white horse frogmore street islington 'that be good news indeed ned ' mr hawtrey said warmly a shook hand with a turned to dorothy saw with surprise that have turned suddenly pale that hand shook a put down cup be pleased be not dorothy ' asked in surprise girl hesitated 'yes said 'of course be pleased in one way not in frightens to think that man may be brought up that may have to give evidence be horrid being talked about must be much worse to stand up to be stared at to have put in paper pooh dear evidence will be very simple ' father said 'you will only have to tell that received first of letter that know nothing of man that assertion that have letter of yours be utterly false 'yes father have noticed that in trial of sort ask such numberless question that always manage somehow to put witness into false light will say how do know that have letter of yours do mean to tell court that have never written letter when have said have never written letter must object to having read out in court will insinuate that be telling lie have done sort of dreadful thing though will not be able to prove word of will know a go out that people will believe have will hate be sure that algernon will hate even more ' 'well algernon have one to thank for having come to pas ' mr hawtrey said sharply 'it be interference going down to scotland yard caused that paragraph to appear in paper if have left matter alone nothing must have be heard about outside circle like halliburn must say that at present nothing must give more satisfaction than to hear that have gone for month upon continent for come round here afternoon worry fuss over matter until upset fill with almost irresistible desire to seize by shoulder turn out of room 'he be little trying father ' dorothy admitted 'but of course doe not like ' 'nor do of be hundred time worse for than be for yet there let change subject what be be saying ned oh yes have heard where truscott life 'not exactly where life public house where be to be met with in case come to pretty well same thing have nothing to do with finding out man slippen took in hand in few hour did more than have done in three week sent fellow down to windsor to betting men knew sent word in evening be rather mortifying must confess feel a if have be taken down several peg in own estimation what be to be done next father dorothy asked anxiously 'ah be point will have to talk over dear at present have not thread of evidence to connect with affair must in first place bring home to afterwards will see whether must have arrested charged in court whether can frighten into making confession be very much afraid that after have be said about there will be nothing for public prosecution however there will be time to think of afterwards captain hampton saw dorothy go pale again mentally resolved that must do in power to save from ordeal from evidently shrank be little surprised at nervousness for a child have be absolutely fearless supposed that worry perhaps fidgeting of halliburn have shaken somewhat a indeed be natural enough 'you be going round to see detective suppose mr hawtrey asked 'yes came in on way for instruction slippen will doubt propose that sharp watch will be kept over movement suppose that there can be doubt be right thing to be done must say so certainly ' 'that at least miss hawtrey will commit to nothing afterwards trust even yet may find way of avoiding unpleasantness feared ' ' may a well go with ned ' mr hawtrey said have nothing particular to do morning walk will do good be getting bilious out of sort with worry must give good round sum to be quietly down in lincolnshire again dorothy evidently feel good deal more than must have thought must ' went on a left house 'it be horribly annoying sort of thing to happen to anyone mr hawtrey because be so desperately difficult to meet anonymous slander of sort of course engagement make so much worse for ' be rub ned be not at pleased with fellow seems to think of nothing manner in affect have have once twice a much a must to let out at have on tip of tongue to say confound sir what deuce do care for family ancestor through whom got title be doubtless respectable enough a far a know may two three generation back have be washer woman when people have already held estate hundred of year of course dorothy take part own belief be that be who be worrying quite a much a scandal 'dorothy be not marrying for title refused higher one than last autumn say that being lord might not have influenced to extent suppose girl have vanity enough to like to carry off man whom score of others will envy for think went very far with believe that a far a knew of liked for not suppose in desperate sort of way a pleasant gentlemanly sort of fellow of whom everyone spoke well whom esteemed thought must be very happy with have occasion to marry for money of course estate be a dare say know entailed will go to cousin jack hawtrey who be sporting parson down in somersetshire good fellow with large family there will be plenty for from mother besides unentailed property ' can not help thinking that halliburn worrying very evident fact that think more of scandal a affecting future wife than of feeling in matter may have shown that have over estimated that although may be very respectable well behaved young nobleman be selfish willow minded fellow after dorothy may say nothing now be not sort of girl to forgive sort of thing mind saying to a old friend ned must not be at surprised if when once affair be thoroughly cleared up throw halliburn over altogether captain hampton made reply have companion turned to look at must hardly have avoided noticing that expression on face expressed anything sympathy with tone of irritation in have spoken mr slippen be in when arrived at clifford inn door be opened by when knocked proof that boy be not at post 'come in captain hampton fancied that must be down here ' 'this be mr hawtrey mr slippen ' said ned a followed into room thought must like to talk over with plan of campaign ' be glad have come sir be always more satisfactory to meet one principal in matter of kind there be le chance of mistake being made be surprising sometimes to find after one be half through one work one have be proceeding under entirely false impression one may think for example that one client be bent upon carrying matter out to bitter end will not hear of anything of compromise then one discovers that be perfectly ready to condone everything to make sacrifice to avoid publicity of course if one have known that in first place must have immensely facilitated matter must be very glad to avoid publicity ' mr hawtrey said 'but unfortunately matter have gone so far that see how can possibly be avoided mr slippen shook head ' see at present ' agreed 'how scandal be to be set at rest except by prosecution of author be to say if can get evidence enough to prosecute of course if have such evidence must be easy enough to force into making complete retractation if did retractation must hardly be satisfactory a supposing be published people must say how be to know that letter be written by fellow who wrote others if be man how be that be not prosecuted for certainly there must be strong suspicion that have be bought off see that ' mr hawtrey agreed ' see other way of clearing matter up except by putting in dock though must give great deal to avoid daughter be extremely averse to idea of publicity attending such affair especially to having to appear a witness be not surprising when one know outrageous licence given to counsel in day to cross examine witness captain hampton noticed sudden keen glance shot at client from mr slippen eye followed by series of almost imperceptible little nod be seized with sudden fierce desire to make violent assault upon unconscious detective rate ' mr hawtrey continued ' see nothing at present to let matter go on for to obtain if possible decisive proof of man connection with letter so far have really only most shadowy ground for suspicion against ' again mr slippen nodded time more openly decisively 'quite most shadowy mr hawtrey be far from saying that may not be man beyond having a understand grievance of very many year duration against there be really nothing whatever to connect with affair 'nothing mr slippen be in fact simply because there be one else against whom have even such slight ground a to go upon suspect fellow of being author of rascally communication 'you will understand mr hawtrey that being employed by consider duty to let know exactly light in matter strike of course know man a do from what have learnt from captain hampton seems to be unprincipled blackguard man who have be concerned in various shady transaction on turf who have come down to rank of lowest class of betting men fellow who pay bet when have made winning book on race be welsher when loses course may be that such man be of so vindictive nature that may have taken trouble simply to annoy can not help thinking that if have embarked upon must have played hand so a not only to annoy to extort money to cease annoyance now writer of letter have certainly not done have have idea of extorting money must have sent sort of private intimation to by mean of cautiously worded letter to effect that arrangement must be made by thing must be put stop to have received such missive therefore if man be author be simply malicious scoundrel not in instance at rate clever rogue a must certainly have expected to find from antecedent 'that be to say think be man 'yes think come almost to mr hawtrey know of course may be man own that will be good deal surprised if find that be so still in absence of other clue propose to follow up will be something at least to clear out of way to have done with will detail boy to watch public house till man come to then to find out where life what be habit to follow footstep take note of place where post letter will get at rate negative evidence way if for instance letter be posted in south of london know on day man never went out of islington think that will be very strong proof that have nothing to do with matter of course reverse must not be so convincing other way if have coincidence three four time repeated of letter bearing mark of district in have dropped one into post must feel that be long way towards proving connection with affair 'quite so mr hawtrey agreed 'that will a say go far to confirm suspicion will altogether clear ground so far a be concerned must then look for clue in other direction altogether afternoon captain hampton having nothing to do made way up to islington lad be not to be put on watch until next morning thought that might see man at public house frequented perhaps glean something from conversation might have with men met there after inquiry a to direction of frogmore street turned up liverpool road have gone few hundred yard when eye fell on couple engaged in earnest conversation on raised walk on opposite side of street paused abruptly in stride one be unquestionably man for whom be seeking be better dressed than when have seen before have more air of gentleman there must be question a to identity other be a unmistakably dorothy hawtrey there be question of accidental likeness be girl herself recognised dress a one have seen wear turning sharply on heel turned down bye street came out into upper street there be too many people here for to think passed on walking in road at edge of pavement to angel then turned down comparatively quiet pavement of pentonville hill what must mean must see one solution yet refused to accept to believe be to believe dorothy hawtrey to be guilty of deception lying be possible that after man must have possessed letter of hers that have be driven at last to meet redeem remembered pallor when have heard that morning that fellow whereabouts have be discovered how have urged that step must be taken against have seemed natural then seemed equally natural now under new light yet refused to believe so told over over again that have seen in conversation with truscott be undeniable of at least be certain equally certain be to that there must be other explanation of meeting than have at first struck what must explanation be answer occurred to must hit upon hypothesis consistent with denial of knowledge of writer of letter be at bottom of hill now disregarding hail of various cabman crossed road made way down through square be better to be walking than sitting still scarcely noticed where be going be almost surprised when found in jermyn street went upstairs lighted cigar sat down 'what be coming to ' said to ' be generally pretty good at guessing riddle there must be explanation of mystery if can hit upon ' after thinking for hour only alternative to first idea have occurred to be that dorothy in horror of idea of public trial of being forced to appear in witness box have taken desperate resolution to find man at address have mentioned to father to bribe to desist from persecution of to warn that unless moved away at once police must be on track be so unlike high spirited child have known girl a have believed still to be that be difficult to credit that must allow to be driven to take step a in order to escape what seemed to minor

up in crowded court exposed to inquisition that in many case be almost martyrdom be awful mistake to have made if scoundrel have be bribed into silence now must be more certain to recommence persecution later on after having once met with paid for silence how must refuse to do so when demand be made one thing seemed to ned hampton unquestionable must maintain absolute silence a to what

refused offer with vehemence declaring absolutely unaffected by story indeed taking injured tone accusing of doubting love for ' be not doubting love algernon ' replied 'but be impossible for to avoid

belief a do that accusation be entirely false be not in way vexed with ' 'nor be dorothy not in slightest degree though own that knowledge that people be talking about doe irritate certainly did not mean to speak crossly to be very sorry if did so so matter have dropped dorothy have none le felt that at time when halliburn ought to have be kinder than usual to have helped to show brave front in face of rumour have added to instead of lightening trouble one morning at breakfast dorothy gave exclamation of surprise upon opening one of letter 'what be dear understand father here be letter from gilliat saying must be obliged if will hand over to assistant who will call for to day whichever of two diamond tiara may have decided not to retain a expects customer afternoon whom might suit know what mean of course have not be choosing jewel must not think of thing without consulting even if have have money enough in pocket to indulge in such adornment handed letter to father 'it must be mistake ' said after glancing through 'the letter must have be meant for one else must be stupid blunder on part of clerk will go round there together after breakfast have not bought anything of sort yet dear be not intending to do so until time came nearer indeed have intended to get mother diamond re set for of course must have gone to gilliat a have always dealt with firm after breakfast drove to bond street ' want to see mr gilliat if be in ' mr hawtrey said mr gilliat be in bey daughter have received letter be evidently meant for one else mr gilliat be about two diamond tiara seems somebody have taken in order to choose one of of course be not intended for gilliat took letter glanced at then at dorothy ' quite understand ' said doubtfully 'not understand mr hawtrey repeated with irritation mean to say that miss hawtrey have be supplied with two diamond tiara 'must mind stepping into room behind mr hawtrey ' jeweller replied leading way into inner room a closed door eye met dorothy with look of inquiry a if asking for instruction hers expressed nothing surprise 'be to understand mr hawtrey ' asked gravely after pause miss hawtrey denies having received tiara 'certainly be ' mr hawtrey said hotly behe know nothing about ' jeweller pressed lip tightly together thought for moment then touched bell on table assistant entered mr williams to step here for moment ' principal assistant entered williams do remember on what day be that miss hawtrey selected two tiara 'it be about three week ago sir can not tell exact day without consulting sale book ' 'do so at once if please ' mr williams went out returned in moment with book 'it be th of last month sir july ' served think mr williams rather perhaps assisted in doing so ' 'certainly sir ' be value of tiara mr williams 'one be twelve hundred other be twelve hundred fifty sir took away ' 'certainly sir offered to place in carriage for said be few door up street must take ' 'you have not shadow of doubt about fact mr williams 'none sir ' assistant said in surprise know miss hawtrey well by sight 'certainly sir have be here many time by herself for repair alteration to watch jewellery with other lady 'thank mr williams will do at present ' door closed jeweller turned to customer mr hawtrey looked confounded daughter bewildered ' understand ' said ' have not be here mr gilliat since beginning of may when came to about replacing pearl have become discoloured in necklace ' remember that visit perfectly miss hawtrey ' jeweller said gravely 'but must confirm what assistant have said allow to recall to that in first place told that in view of approaching event required tiara of diamond of course having heard of engagement to lord halliburn understood allusion came in here with have honour of showing five six tiara of selected two said that must like to show to mr hawtrey before choosing offered to send assistant with said that carriage be standing few door off that must rather take firm having have honour of serving mr hawtrey family for several generation knowing perfectly have of course hesitation in complying with request may say a evidence of exactness of memory that miss hawtrey be dressed exactly a be at present have of course opportunity of noticing dress a be examining good have on that blue walking dress with small red spot bonnet with blue feather with red tip 'will give hour a well a day at say daughter called here ' mr hawtrey said sternly own impression be that be about three o'clock ' jeweller said after moment thought 'will call assistant ask ' mr williams being summoned said that have distinct recollection a to precise time that be certainly somewhat early in afternoon have returned from lunch about two be not for little time after miss hawtrey called must say be between three half past three 'that will be near enough mr hawtrey said 'you will hear from again shortly mr gilliat know can rely upon to say nothing in meantime to anyone on subject 'certainly mr hawtrey ' dorothy let be going ' dorothy at moment be unable to follow father have sunk down in chair pale trembling look of intense surprise have given way to one of alarm horror be not until have water that jeweller brought that recovered sufficiently to take father arm walk through shop to carriage dorothy ' mr hawtrey said a drove off 'what doe mean have not least idea father be utterly bewildered ' 'you still say that did not go to shop that did not examine tiara choose two of ' 'of course say so father have never be in shop since went about pearl surely father can not suspect of having stolen thing ' be last man in world to suspect of anything dishonourable dorothy evidence be staggering here be two men ready to swear to whole particular of incident be sufficiently acquainted with appearance to be able to recognise readily can even swear to dress that must do thing seems to be incredible impossible what be to think must not have done thing in sens must be act of madwoman especially to go to shop where be so well known ' 'but why must have done father must not have worn without being detected at once 'you must not have worn ' father agreed might have be turned into money have great occasion for ' dorothy started mean father oh surely never can mean must have stolen thing to turn into money in order to satisfy man who have be writing letter dear mean that be certainly what anyone who did not know must say there cry so child ' for dorothy be sobbing hysterically now ' let talk more until get home have got day hour at be supposed to have be at gilliat perhaps may be able to prove that be engaged somewhere else that be impossible must have be at gilliat about time ' nothing more be said until reached home 'you have better come into study dorothy will not be disturbed there now dear ' said have matter out can only say if again give assurance that be absolutely ignorant of that never went to gilliat on day say did will accept assurance a implicitly a did before before speak remember dear what that entail people be prepared to swear to will of course take step to obtain payment for thing if such step be taken whole matter will be gone into to bottom remember everything depends on frankness will be terribly painful for to acknowledge that after have got into entanglement that did in moment of madness take thing in order to free from must be terribly painful for to hear upon hearing must of course take step to raise twenty five hundred pound for at present happen to have so much at banker to settle gilliat claim even painful a must be must be thousand time better than to have gone into in public on other hand if still assure that know nothing of must refuse to pay money because to do so must be to admit that took thing because in second place whoever have taken tiara for one have done so can not doubt may again personate involve in fresh trouble difficulty ' did not do father indeed did not do have have entanglement be in need of money have never be near gilliat shop unless indeed be altogether out of mind did in state of unconsciousness can not think for moment have worried over until hardly knew what be doing never must have gone to shop done a say without having remembrance of why last place must choose if have ever thought of stealing must be place where be perfectly known indeed father be altogether innocent can not account for not in least be sure have nothing to do with ' dear will not doubt for moment ' mr hawtrey said kissing tenderly 'now just stand in same position a did in regard to other affair have got to find out about in first place get book of engagement let see what be doing on afternoon of th dorothy went out of room soon returned with pocket book satisfactory can see mr hawtrey said a glanced at face 'no father here be see lunch with mr milford nothing else remember about afternoon now drove in carriage to mr milford have lunch at half past one there be one other lady there mr milford have ticket for concert at st james hall think be be not sure about have headache must not go with besides have shopping to do got out of brougham in hanover square went into bond street certainly got glove scent then went into cock looked through new music chose one two piece then went into french gallery mr milford have be talking about at lunch so thought must drop in there be very few people there so sauntered round sat down looked at liked best be quiet pleasant must have be in there long time when came out took cab drove straight home be six o'clock when got back remember went straight up to room have cup of tea there then took off gown maid combed hair a be time for to dress for dinner head be aching good deal did good dined at livingstone that evening ' 'it be unfortunate certainly dorothy have hoped might have be able to have fixed somewhere must have proved conclusively that must not possibly have be at gilliat afternoon a be recollection help at for time from somewhere about three till six be practically unaccounted for people bought glove scent from must prove that be there probably must not have be many minute in shop cock may remember that be there quarter of hour so ' ' think be there hour father ' 'well say hour rest of time be really in picture gallery be scarcely likely that even if man who took money at door attendant inside noticed sufficiently to swear to face must be able to fix day still le have noticed how long stayed at rate be clear that must be possible for to have done say did that afternoon still to have spared time for visit to gilliat ' see that be terrible father what can mean 'that be more than can understand dorothy at present be face to face with what seems to two impossibility mean looking at from outsider point of view one be that shopmen must have taken one else for when be so well acquainted with face be able to swear even to dress le difficult be to believe that did require money so urgently that be ready to commit crime to obtain must go to people to whom be perfectly well known so destroy hope even possibility of crime passing undetected one theory be a difficult to believe a other letter be mystery affair be infinitely more puzzling really know what to do must take advice in matter of course must rather pay money five time over than permit to become public who be to know what form strange persecution be to take next think there be connection between other father mr hawtrey shook head ' see most remote connection between two thing there may be who can say must rather face out ' dorothy said passionately must rather be imprisoned a thief than go on a have be doing for last six week anything must be better even if be to pay money story might get about somehow just a other did then fact that paid must be looked upon a proof have taken diamond who will consult father bey lawyer must be proper people to consult undoubtedly be quite useless before be wholly out of line think will take hansom go across to jermyn street see if can find ned hampton in have great faith in judgment one must be kinder than have be in matter mind speaking to ' 'oh father must rather that must speak to than to one ' captain hampton be in listened in silent consternation to mr hawtrey story for long time made answer to question can make head tail of ned what do think ' at first sight seemed to that story explained meeting have seen opposite agricultural hall have turned diamond into money have handed over to man to buy silence then faith in dorothy rose again be absolutely absurd to suppose for moment that must have thus committed crime must be certainly brought home to must ruin far more than revelation man might make must do 'it be extraordinary story mr hawtrey ' said at last 'even putting knowledge of daughter character out of question be possible to believe that young lady possessed of ordinary shrewdness must go to place where be well known have acted in way that be reported to have done 'it must certainly seem incredible ned here be two three people prepared to swear that did do so that identified by dress a well a by herself 'we must look at matter in light mr hawtrey however confident may feel of innocence must look at from light in other people will regard will say of course that miss hawtrey have urgent need of money for purpose other will naturally suppose that reason to be desire to silence author of letter will say that although must of course know that bill must be sent in to father must be sure that must rather pay money than betray sin to world quite see that ' mr hawtrey agreed 'but if have be driven to desperation by fellow why did not come direct to in first place instead of committing theft to drive to pay when might be pretty sure in way other fact must leak out do infinitely more harm with world than indiscretion committed year ago must do besides have done for purpose must not have carried through course of action when bill came in have implored to pay without question so save from disgrace ruin ' 'that certainly be so ' captain hampton said a face brightened visibly 'the more one think of more mysterious affair seems must like to think over quietly suppose will not go out evening ' 'certainly not there will be no more going out until mystery have be cleared up have be hard enough for dorothy to bear up over last trouble must be out of question for to go into society with terrible thing hanging over 'then will come round about nine o'clock will have have time to think over before ' captain hampton cogitation came to nothing walked up down little room until lodger in parlour below went out in despair to club tried effect of hour stroll in least frequented part of kensington garden drove to mr slippen to inquire if clue have be obtained a to truscott movement ate solitary dinner at lodging smoked enormous quantity of tobacco must see clue to mystery meeting have witnessed be to piece of evidence far more damning than of jeweller assistant if must explain that other matter might be got over though must not see how if must not explain be evident that have nothing to do to advise father to settle business at cost chapter vii at nine o'clock captain hampton called at chester square be shown into drawing room from a previously arranged mr hawtrey have dismissed mr daintree telling that have private matter to discus with ned hampton mr daintree have retired tearfully saying that for part preferred hearing nothing about painful matter meaning that of letter for be ignorant of later development dorothy looked flushed feverish eye be large brilliant there be restlessness in manner a shook hand with old friend ned asked with attempt at playfulness 'what be verdict guilty not guilty ' 'you need not ask dorothy even evidence of own eye must scarcely avail to convince against word ' then turned to father ' have done nothing think matter over since left can see one solution utterly improbable one admit will not tell what be until have spoken to miss hawtrey must mind putting question two to alone ' 'certainly not ned ' said mr hawtrey rising dorothy exclaimed 'no father will not have so know what captain hampton be going to ask nothing that can ask answer must wish not to hear please sit down again there will be mystery between at rate ' 'perhaps be best so ' captain hampton agreed though felt ring of pain in girl voice at what believed to be sign that doubted ' be willing a said just now to disbelieve evidence of own eye on word be determined to believe innocent be impossible for to do otherwise there be one matter want cleared up on fifteenth of last month be day on thing be missed saw lady so exactly like in face in dress must under other circumstance be prepared to swear to speaking to man truscott in liverpool road islington be at about past four in afternoon ' look of blank wonderment passed across dorothy face a spoke then changed into one of indignation ' be never in islington in life captain hampton never heard name of liverpool road know of have never seen man truscott since day at epsom have believed believe must meet man alone for purpose suppose of bribing to silence have be mistaken in altogether captain hampton thought be friend dorothy ' father said authoritatively a with head erect walked towards door must listen to be altogether too important to be treated in way must hear what captain hampton really saw will tell why did not mention fact to before sit down dear now captain hampton please tell to again ' ned hampton repeated story then went on 'you know went suddenly out of town mr hawtrey have be mistaken never once occurred to up to time have never for instant doubted daughter assertion that knew nothing a to letter in possession of truscott morning a may remember mentioned before name of place where be to be found when a thought saw with certainly appeared to possible that after dread miss hawtrey expressed of appearing in public court to prosecute might in moment of weakness have gone off to see man to warn of consequence must ensue if continued to persecute to tell that unless moved must in few hour be in custody thought action altogether foreign to nature own that never for moment occurred to to doubt evidence of own eye especially a person be dressed exactly a daughter have be when saw that morning that person saw be not be now quite ready to admit in case be morally certain that person who took away jewel be also not strengthens idea have before conceived seemed a told most improbable one namely that there be person who so closely resembles daughter that might be mistaken for if so person be acting with man truscott must conjecture be true one explains what have hitherto be so mysterious letter be designed to injure daughter in public estimation to prepare way for extraordinary robbery must enrich truscott a well a gratify revenge what do think mr hawtrey ' idea be too new for to grasp altogether ned until now there seemed possible explanation of mystery certainly strange improbable a be doe afford solution 'well father will leave to talk over ' dorothy said rising again 'unless captain hampton have seen anywhere else wish to question about also think father that will be much better in future to put matter altogether into hand of lawyer must be business to do best for whether thought innocent guilty at rate be more pleasant to be suspected by people know nothing about than by thought be friend then without waiting for answer swept from room use stopping now father said shrugging shoulder be not often have known dorothy fairly out of temper from time be child when be be better to let cool down come round of herself ' 'it will be long time before come round a far a be concerned ' captain hampton said ' be not surprised that must be indignant must have suspected for moment see how must have helped saw someone a much like a if be in looking glass talking to man truscott very day when have for first time found out where be likely to lay hand on what must anyone suppose did not think for moment that have done anything really wrong even after what have said that must hold letter of importance have evidently so great dread of publicity that a say did strike have gone to meet in order to warn perhaps to get back trumpery letter might have have stolen from from one else did think up to time when told of affair at jeweller seemed so utterly wholly impossible that became convinced there must be entirely different solution if must hit upon only idea occurred to be that of there being one else exactly like that person whoever be have be used by truscott to injure daughter to obtain plunder ' see how must have helped suspecting a did when saw truscott speaking with one whom did not doubt being dorothy have be in place witnessed that meeting seems to that must have doubted though be father own did doubt for moment morning when story at gilliat let leave alone for moment ned pressing question be what be to do ' will give opinion captain hampton said firmly 'that must be question for miss hawtrey to decide if conjecture be right man truscott woman closely resembling daughter be working to obtain plunder on strength of likeness may be sure that successful coup have made will only be first of series on other hand have not shadow of evidence to adduce against gilliat claim there be simply assertion against of two three other people if sue a of course will if pay seems to certain that jury must give verdict against unless of course can put other woman truscott into dock must such verdict be given although might have doubt a to extraordinary story public in general must conclude that miss hawtrey be thief liar there be doubt that daughter advice be one to be followed if be must go to charles levine first thing in morning lay whole case before put in hand will do so ned must mention to that saw

have quite vanished say that be only chance there be of getting to bottom of thing that if be not done must go away to china siberia out of way place where one will know then went to levine danvers called for took there wrote to last night asked to do so nothing must have be more polite than levine manner must say must be charming fellow at dinner table went into whole thing with took note while be talking asked question now then of course told last notion that there must be somebody about exactly like dorothy in face figure dress too asked with little sort of emphasis yes dress too said when have done simply said that be singular case must have told well enough that must like to take little time to think over present idea be that have best pay money told that did not care rap about money that if thing got about fact have compromised must be altogether ruinous to daughter said think can rely upon that gilliat will preserve absolute silence can assure that jeweller get to know great many curious family history be part of business to be discreet yes said see if a believe fellow truscott got up first persecution purely to revenge what belief be grievance against if be so if have connection with second business may be sure that somehow other will get something nasty about put in one of gutter journal silenced again said must think over when got up to go asked danvers to wait few minute a took that if matter went into court must a matter of course be retained on side so came away by drove here worst of be believe that man think that dorothy did of course a doe not know be not altogether to be blamed be deucedly annoying to have to do with man who evidently think daughter be thief 'did say anything a to idea that one else must have represented ' 'not single word listened attentively while told made remark about ' after door of mr levine office have closed behind mr hawtrey solicitor leant back in chair looked at danvers with raised eyebrow have heard story before suppose ' asked ' heard about first business not about matter of jewel except that gave slight outline a drove here morning be curious business 'it be very unpleasant business scarcely curious one ' lawyer said with grave smile have heard so many bit of queer family history scarcely look at anything way now a curious must be astonished simply astonished did know how often thing of kind occur ' think that miss hawtrey took jewel mr levine eyebrow went up again in surprise at question impression so far be said 'as between solicitor counsel that there be not slightest doubt in world about girl have got into bad sort of scrape blackguard have got under thumb have good marriage on hand be absolutely necessary to shut fellow mouth largish sum be wanted dared not ask father so played bold stroke wonderfully bold stroke must say relying upon brazening out getting father to believe a evidently have succeeded in doing that there be double of herself somewhere about who represented first part of case be comparatively ordinary one be curious even to in daring audacity be really magnificent of course father must pay money to defend must be to ruin utterly do mean to say agree with ' ' hardly know what to think danvers said doubtfully know miss hawtrey intimately have done so for year in spite of apparent impossibility of innocence own can not bring to believe in guilt be one of brightest frankest most natural girl know ' lawyer looked at with smile of almost pity 'you surprise sir experience be that in majority of case of kind be just very last girl one must suspect who go wrong why dear sir if be to set up such ridiculous defence a in action to recover price of jewel must simply be laughed out of court hawtrey tell that daughter be most anxious that must defend case again eyebrow went up 'of course must say so must know well enough that whether father put into hand one else advice must be same pay money have shadow of chance of getting verdict to bring into court must utterly ruin daughter prospect of course be cue to appear anxious for trial knowing perfectly well that thing be out of question think might alter opinion if saw ' ' certainly must be glad to see charles levine said admire talent must be amazingly clever have great respect for audacity never heard in experience of more brilliant piece of boldness than must be great actress too of highest order altogether must be very glad to see deserves to succeed a there be doubt that will be able to persuade father that there be nothing for to pay money think success be pretty well assured ' agree with that money must be paid be not prepared to go further yet ' bey dear sir ' lawyer said confirm opinion have always held that judgment of man under fifty be worth penny where young pretty woman be concerned mind there be many men perhaps majority who can not be trusted in such matter up to time of life up to fifty rule be almost universal ' be glad to hear ' danvers said 'for in case own judgment can not be accepted a final rather expected that mr danvers must remember that in matter of kind have have more experience than dozen ordinary men of age of eighty now really can not spare more time have given client good two hour waiting room must be full of angry men will write to mr hawtrey to morrow to say that upon thinking matter well over first impression be more than confirmed that be of opinion that jury in world must give verdict that must be nothing short of insanity to go into court will mention of course that be much struck with theory of affair indeed appears to to furnish only complete explanation of matter that in absence of single confirmatory piece of evidence must be hopeless for most eloquent counsel to attempt to persuade twelve british juryman to entertain theory think must be a well if be to call on evening to morrow morning shew that view agrees with mine that much can honestly say can not ' 'certainly however difficult may find to persuade that miss hawtrey be in way woman picture be a convinced a be that be absolutely necessary that money must be paid on mr hawtrey reaching home found mr daintree upon sofa in tear while dorothy with book in hand be sitting with unconcerned expression short distance from 'what be matter now asked testily word believe annoyance must have upset job ' 'must believe cousin dorothy have just declared to intention of writing to lord halliburn to break off match mr hawtrey did not explode a cousin have expected that must do 'it be not step to be taken hastily said gravely 'but be one upon dorothy be best judge have not written yet child ' father must not think of doing so without telling first have of course be thinking good deal about certainly seems to that must be best ' 'well few hour will make difference idea be at present new to will think over quietly afternoon evening will talk over together 'it must be nothing short of madness for to do so mr daintree said roused to state of real anger by mr hawtrey defection when have implicitly relied upon authority being exerted to prevent dorothy from carrying out intention must be madness to break off so excellent match must make talk of whole town must seem to confirm wicked rumour have be going about ' 'as to match cousin there be a good fish in sea a ever came out of a to public talk be better to be talked about for week two than to have life unhappiness be sole point with concern ' dorothy with softened face now got up kissed father 'that be right dear said 'now let put matter aside for present have be busy morning want lunch badly so even if be not hungry come down keep company come cousin dry eye put cap straight come down to lunch ' 'food must choke ' mr daintree said ' have dreadful headache will go lie down chapter viii danvers be in library sir ' servant announced at nine o'clock evening 'will come down dorothy ' father want to hear what be said doubt will suppose took diamond 'no dear must not say that ' 'but do say that father when even captain hampton be willing enough to believe guilty what can expect from others 'you be too hard on ned altogether dorothy great deal too hard spent month of leave entirely in service now because must not disbelieve evidence of own eye turn against ' ' be obliged to for trouble have taken father be not what want at present want trust thought that if one must have given to fully must have be ned hampton nothing must have made doubt ' dear ' father said dryly 'you may think so now if be to see filling pocket out of bank till fancy for moment trust in must waver however will go down to danvers returned at end of twenty minute advice be same a a mentioned afternoon levine gave when told of circumstance have doubt will repeat when have further thought matter over namely that unless can obtain evidence to support denial have chance of obtaining verdict if go into court danvers say that of course to who know idea of taking diamond be absolutely preposterous still a jury will not know public who read report will not know can only go by evidence say that trying to look at a stranger opinion must be that be extraordinary case that unless believed thoroughly that have not taken thing must never have taken so hopeless case into court still think that verdict of who only look at outside of thing must be that denial be almost worse than act have not be for unfortunate rumour previously circulated many people might be of opinion that be case of kleptomania that woman in sens must have thus openly carried thing away from place where be well known ' see that father more have thought over more feel that be certain that one will be against ' 'then in case dorothy why fight battle be certain to lose from money point of view alone must be better to pay twenty five hundred pound than twenty five hundred pound cost on side might put down roughly at thousand if pay now matter may never become public for even if scoundrel be malicious enough to try get rumour about into one of so called society paper must doubt whether must do so in last case got report doubt from one in scotland yard editor must be mad enough to risk action for libel with tremendous damage merely on anonymous report at best report given only on authority of impecunious hanger on of turf seems to therefore that must have everything to lose nothing to gain by bringing matter into court ' 'but same thing may be done again father if have succeeded so well now be sure to try repeat ' 'we might take measure to prevent doing that moment thing be settled will go down into country when return to town next season will get companion for bright sensible woman who will not be half time laid up with headache who will always go with whenever go out so that be attempt made again must be in position to prove conclusively where be at time danvers suggested that if pay money to gilliat must do so with written protest to effect be convinced that have not be in shop on day in question that a be not in position to prove paid money reserving to myself right to reclaim must be at time in position to prove that have not be at shop on day be able to produce woman who represented must matter by chance ever crop up again copy of protest must be advantage rate father must never marry lord halliburn unless matter be entirely cleared up must be unfair to in extreme might receive anonymous letter from people if asked if be true what must say have be greatly upset by other business what must say did know have be accused of theft brings back to subject of engagement have be thinking over since lunch father ' 'yes dear have be thinking over a well a must again repeat that only light in can regard be that of happiness quite see that being engaged to man in position doe add to embarrassment difficulty of position have to consider not only ourselves still that matter after comparatively little supposing matter be cleared up satisfactorily how must stand then might then bitterly regret step now want to take ' father up to time when trouble first began think that thought very seriously about lord halliburn be very nice liked a much a man have met suppose be gratified by attention one spoke well of own be rather proud of carrying off really seemed to that be likely to be very happy with since then have looked at in different way knew of course that husband wife be supposed to share other trouble have never really seemed to that there be likelihood of trouble coming into life well trouble have come with have come to look at thing differently to begin with have learnt more of lord halliburn character than probably must have done in life if such trouble have not come ' have be disappointed in say that in first matter doubted for instant be not that found out that be altogether selfish have thought through not how affected how must affect have be querulous exacting impatient have be man thought must have be kinder more attentive than before must have tried to let one see by manner to how wholly trusted must have striven to make thing easier for have made much harder if held in hand now proof missing text against must send to at same time letter breaking off engagement when think over be sometimes inclined to be almost grateful to trouble because have opened eye to fact have be very nearly making great mistake have married lord halliburn life might have gone on smoothly enough that there must never have be real community of feeling between must have regarded a useful perhaps ornamental head to house must never have have home in true sense of word father be home like be settled dear now that have said a much a have need not say word on matter must say frankly have of late come almost to dislike have several time cost inconsiderable effort to keep temper when saw how entirely regarded matter in personal light how little thought gave to pain trouble be going through be in hurry to lose dear thought that might be few month have given many heartache now how will do will write to see ' ' must rather tell father ' 'you see dear for sake own must be publicly known that engagement be broken by not by must be very unfair on for to be supposed that have taken advantage of rumour to break off engagement must greatly injure a people must say that must have become convinced of truth ' dorothy nodded will see father will speak to quite frankly will tell that attack having be made on be possible that there may be at future time other trouble from same source that must be unfair to in position a member of ministry for wife to be made target of such attack will also tell that quite apart from feel that acted too hastily upon insufficient knowledge of in accepting that be convinced that marriage must not bring to of happiness that have right to expect be will say unless press to go into detail then will speak just a frankly a have done to ' 'well dear can only say be heartily glad ' mr hawtrey said kissing 'and be inclined to feel almost grateful to fellow truscott for giving back little girl again of course know must come day after having be so much to other for so many year be little trying at first to feel that one be longer first in affection idea of such thing father ' dorothy said indignantly 'as if ever for moment put before 'well if have not child show very conclusively that did not care for a girl must care for man be going to marry say that be so in many marriage be a term arranged in society where there be real honest love that there ought to be such a hope will day feel for one becomes a must become first in everything ' 'it seems to quite impossible father must love other man a do ' mr hawtrey smiled hope will learn be very possible day dorothy well at rate have done away with chief reason for objecting to paying for diamond doubt will hear from levine time to morrow at rate there be reason to decide finally for day two gilliat can be in hurry month delay may make difference in situation 'well dear be over ' mr hawtrey asked next day when dorothy came into study 'it be relief to when saw brougham drive off for knew that must be having unpleasant time of ' 'yes have not be pleasant father came in looking anxious a generally have done of late thinking that request for to call morning meant that there be news of sort pleasant otherwise told at once have be seriously thinking over matter for time have for several reason come to conclusion that must be better that engagement must terminate then gave first reason be very earnest protested that a have never for moment believed in rumour must not see that there be reason for breaking off engagement said that did full justice in respect that matter have certainly be great source of annoyance to be convinced of probability of further trouble of same kind that a have be powerless to detect author of might be a powerless in future then frankly told that knew that hope be greatly centred in political career that for to have wife who be subject of scandal must be very serious drawback to did not attempt to deny then urged that breach of engagement at present must be taken to mean that have be affected by rumour said that full justice must be done to in respect then a still protested though be convinced that at heart felt relieved added that there be certain other reason into need not go fully that thought that have accepted without sufficient consideration have gradually come to feel that be not altogether suited to other that wife must always occupy secondary position in thought politics public business occupying first said that have be brought up perhaps in old fashioned way entertained old fashioned idea that wife must hold first place 'he be disposed to be angry because doubt felt that be perfectly true however said be angry lord halliburn will be very very sorry if part other than good friend like esteem very much have not be for trouble must never have thought of breaking engagement to a be be thinking a much of a of be convinced will have further trouble perhaps more serious one have already in fact have sort of warning of if come must make much harder for to bear be name associated together for feel that prospect must be seriously injured a well a own 'you talk over very calmly coolly said irritably ' said that have be thinking over calmly for month more be sure that be best for of so at last parted good friend have doubt be relief to a be to just at first suppose be natural that must be upset think have ever thought for moment of breaking off be quite sure that if other thing come out will congratulate most heartily well there be end of father ' dear be sorry at same time be glad think dear that be sort of girl who must ever have be very happy if have married without very real love in matter for part can see nothing enviable in life of woman who spends whole life in what be called society two three month of gaiety in year may be well enough to live always in seems to one of most wretched way of spending one existence now dear let change subject altogether think for next few day have better go out again propose that leave town at end of week go down home what must be better go for couple of month on continent will give time for gossip over engagement being broken off to die out did not put off engagement to dine at dean to day ' father must not write say two day beforehand be unwell unable to come ' havery well then will go always like dinner because come from neighbourhood one always meet three four of lincolnshire friend 'it be botanical afternoon father will go there with cousin mary ' 'do so by mean dear a drove that evening to dean mr hawtrey said have that letter from levine a be dressing dorothy go over nearly same ground a danvers did be also of opinion must pay under protest in order that if at time can lay hand on real offender can claim return of money will go round in morning have talk with gilliat ' dorothy be more than have be for week engagement have since trouble first began be greater burden to than have be willing to admit even to herself lord halliburn have jarred upon constantly have come almost to dread daily meeting at early stage of trouble have thought matter out have come to conclusion that have made mistake be not long in arriving at determination that must at end of season ask to release from engagement before hoped that rumour have affected must have died out completely must not necessarily be associated with termination of engagement have not fresh trouble arisen matter must have gone on on old footing until late in autumn new trouble have forced to act at once first thought have be that be only fair to to release at once be surprised now at weight have be lifted from mind at buoyancy of spirit felt be almost indifferent a to other matter 'you be more like than have be for week dorothy ' father said during drive feel like bird have got out of cage father be not bad cage be very nicely gilt in way desirable one still be cage feel very happy indeed in feeling that be out of ' dorothy enjoyed dinner laughed talked merrily with gentleman who have taken down mr dean remarked to husband afterwards that absence of lord halliburn who sent letter of regret important business must prevent fulfilling engagement did not seem to be great disappointment to dorothy hawtrey ' never saw in better spirit dear lately have be feeling quite anxious about be beginning to look quite worn from trouble of abominable story expect feel halliburn absence positive relief said 'you know remarked last time saw out how glum sulky looked said that if be in place must throw over without hesitation know said so do know wondered at dinner whether have not come to same conclusion have lot of spirit ' mr dean said 'and be quite capable of kicking over trace must say there be pluckier rider than girl in lincolnshire fancy that woman who doe flinch from stiffest jump must not hesitate for moment in throwing over even best match of season if offended be dear good girl be dorothy hawtrey think that be bit spoilt by success season always thought made mistake in accepting halliburn be not half good enough for may be earl under secretary of state be more fit to run in harness with dorothy hawtrey than be to fly ' when gentleman came up after dinner dorothy made room on sofa on be sitting for old friend who walked across to mr singleton be near neighbour down in lincolnshire be bachelor dorothy have always be great pet of dear ' said a took seat beside be heartily glad to see looking quite again to night to know have be able to help little favourite out of scrape ' dorothy eye opened wide 'to help out of scrape mr singleton why what scrape have helped out of beg pardon dear ' said hastily told must never speak of matter again here be like old fool bringing up very first time meet ' dorothy face paled ber singleton ' said ' seem to be surrounded by mystery do understand to say that have done kindness lately helped out of scrape dear be own word replied looking surprised in turn 'but please let say anything more about ' dorothy sat quiet for minute then made sign to father who be standing at other side of room to come across to 'father ' said 'will ask mr singleton to drive home with be afraid there be fresh trouble at rate must speak to be not place for question please let go a soon a carriage come now will please go away mr singleton leave to myself for minute two for head be in whirl dear ' began be stopped by impatient wave of dorothy hand 'what be singleton ' mr hawtrey asked a went across room be completely puzzled ' replied 'what dorothy mean by asking to come with to answer question be complete mystery to please ask question now have evidently put foot into somehow though have not least idea how ' ten minute later carriage be announced a took place in dorothy said ' ask question until be at home ' two men be far too puzzled to talk on indifferent subject not word be spoken until arrived at chester square mr daintree gone to bed ' dorothy asked footman miss hawtrey went quarter of hour ago ' 'be light still burning in drawing room ' miss went upstairs dorothy what doe mean ' father asked impatiently 'that be what have got to learn father mr singleton congratulated on having recovered spirit took credit to for having helped out of scrape a in least know what mean want to give particular dear dorothy mr singleton said on earth do ask that question surely can not wish to mention anything about trifling affair ' 'but do mr singleton know position in be placed at present be surrounded by mystery be accused of thing never did now seems a if there be fresh one possibly if tell exact particular of what be speaking of may help to get to bottom of ' ' understand in least mr singleton said gravely 'you be quite sure dorothy that wish to repeat before father exact detail of interview ' please mr singleton little minute particular course will do a wish dear ' old gentleman said kindly 'it seems to madness if really wish will do so if make mistake correct at once well be story hawtrey need not tell must never have passed lip except at dorothy request short time since fortnight three week can not tell day exactly servant brought up word that lady wished to see have given no name supposed be one of charity collecting woman so told to show in to surprise be miss dorothy after shaking hand sat down to astonishment burst into tear be time before must pacify get to tell be matter then told that have got into dreadful scrape that dared not tell that must be ruin to that have come to a one of oldest friend to ask if must help to get out of 'of course said must do anything at last with great difficulty after burst of cry told that must have thousand pound to save said something about wanting to pawn of jewel must not come to enough of course pooh poohed said be very sorry to hear that have got into scrape that thousand pound be trifle to in comparison to happiness of daughter of old friend be very reluctant to receive wanted at least to pawn jewel for two three hundred pound said that be nonsense eventually drew cheque for thousand pound made payable to mary brown bearer a naturally did not wish name to appear at in matter be most grateful for told that of course must never allude to matter again that be not to trouble about in slightest for have put down for five thousand pound in will must change figure to four so that must only be getting money little earlier than have intended evening unfortunately be stupid enough in saying be pleased to see looking more like old self to add be glad to know have be mean of helping little favourite out of scrape be stupid of admit to have even thus far broken promise never to allude to thing again why must have insisted upon telling story painful to of to be altogether beyond comprehension ' mr hawtrey be too much astonished to ask question looked helplessly at dorothy who said quietly 'thank for telling story mr singleton thank still more for so generously coming a believed to assistance can not remember exactly day be ' dear must see date on counterfoil of cheque book ' fifteenth of last month mr singleton ' well can not say exactly must be somewhere about time ' 'and about what time of day beome time in afternoon know somewhere between three four must say know have not be back long after lunching at traveller generally leave there about three be not more than five minute walk up to albany father please tell mr singleton about gilliat ' 'but dorothy mr singleton exclaimed when heard story be absolutely impossible that must have done thing ' 'it seems to impossible mr singleton here be evidence of two people did do now have evidence that on same afternoon came to obtained thousand pound from either two men be dreaming out of mind be dreaming out of mind be out of mind do thing unconsciously own belief be that can account for whole afternoon repeated detail that have given father a to movement even if must have done thing without knowing where be jewel where be cheque 'the cheque be presented next day paid came back with bank book at end of month 'it be not often go out in morning ' dorothy said 'and must think must prove did not do so on morning of th can not be sure if in state of somnambulism in sort of trance did not call at jeweller on might have gone out have changed that cheque in similar state must have be straightforward thing how must get rid of jewel if have now wanted to raise money on must not have least idea how to do so must hardly have carried out such scheme in state of unconsciousness jeweller say be dressed in blue dress with red spot went out in gown of pattern on day ' did not notice dress particularly mr singleton said 'but be certainly blue of sort of course be quite out of question that must have done thing unconsciously what doe mean be absolutely bewildered ' 'we have only one theory to account for singleton believe in fact be positively convinced that there be somewhere girl so exactly resembling dorothy even who know well like might take one for other that perhaps accomplice be taking advantage of likeness to personate dorothy have even gone length of having dress made exactly like hers will now tell real
