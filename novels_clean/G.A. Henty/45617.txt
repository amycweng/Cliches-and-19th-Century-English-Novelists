come from somewhere though nobody have ever hit spot yet be ready to go where like sim doctor said a have often told before miner be altogether wrong in notion a one can see with eye by fact that whether be down here in bottom of gulch whether be up on flat foot above always find gravel now flat be once bed of great river be when mountain round be ten of thousand of foot higher than be now must have be there must never be water enough for river a must have be river must have rolled on for thousand of year for gravel can see in place be foot thick be water worn whether be big boulder little stone have be rolled about well in time mountain be worn away there be water then for big river water from hill a see now began to cut fresh channel yuba be one of lie thousand foot below old gravel bed in place have crossed old bed gold came down from former mountain into gravel have be washed down into valley will never find a dream of doing quartz vein stuck full of gold there may have be vein like in old mountain quartz vein that find now lot of have be assayed be very poor have got gold in scarce enough to pay for working even when get best machinery fancy gold go off with depth though why must can not say that quartz vein near surface have big nugget be choke full of small stuff just pettered away to nothing a went deeper be why think sim that will find quartz reef worth working anywhere now why be le likely to find much pay dirt in upper gorge because water there have not gone through old gravel field a have in winding lower down according to doctor must find richest of if be to sink in bed of river down by plain not at not at bill from point where yuba course leaf old gravel bed of big river make own way through hill down to plain have picked up more gold a know big nugget be generally found pretty high up a be natural must be for a soon a new river washed out of old bed must sink down in convenient hole a in course of age yuba cut down deeper deeper must go down too weight must prevent rolling far light stuff must wash down moving onwards with sand gravel so a search lower down get better surface washing find le coarse gold dare say be right doctor sim howlett said yawning so wo go prospecting up in hill though nice little find have be made up there in spite of what say vote leave open until have cleared up then look round new rush may be started

sand on shoulder be panning out very rich such be sample of description three men be unmoved by knew too well how untrustworthy be report many be a have be said work of store keeper others be invention of miner desirous of disposing of claim to new comer shifting to more promising region little be said of fabulous price of provision of fever decimated of camp of total abandonment of others yet even miner although knowing by frequent experience that dependence must be placed on report be prone to cling to hope that time be correct road be thronged by party who having failed at one camp

believed that chance of meeting symonds again be a good among mining camp a elsewhere illustration illustration chapter iii wanderer return have circumstance of william tunstall leaving home be more recent have son of edgar tunstall be older news that william tunstall have returned have taken up residence at byrneside a master of portion of estate left by brother a guardian to young heir to remainder must have caused good deal of interest excitement in county twenty year however that have elapsed since will tunstall have left home fact that when went away be lad quite unknown personally to father acquaintance deprived matter of personal interest have generally be thought that be hard that must have be entirely cut out of father will clause forbidding brother to make division of property be considered particularly so especially a be known that edgar be attached to brother must have gladly shared property with william have be away twenty year one have personal interest in ten year have elapsed since have be finally disinherited by father will beyond feeling of satisfaction that justice have be done that there must not be long minority at byrneside news that eldest son have returned created excitement messrs randolph son of carlisle who be business agent for estate in county reported well of new comer have never seen a boy expressed a agreeably surprised that long period have passed knocking about among rough people in state have in way affected unfavourably manner be particularly good appearance be altogether in favour be true cumberland man tall powerful like father brother though somewhat slighter in build be accompanied by wife yes have seen have dined with have not be previously aware that mr tunstall be married client mr edgar tunstall have not mentioned fact to be not prepared to give decided opinion a to mr tunstall have spoken little struck a being nervous probably position be novel one for there be understood child messrs randolph father son old fashioned practitioner have from first considered scruple of agent in san francisco to be absurd mr tunstall have presented a soon a have advertised have produced letter of brother a proof of identity have offered to bring forward witness who have known for year a william tunstall what on earth must have have more than mr tunstall have have reason already for resentment be not surprising that have refused to set out at once for england when found identity so absurdly questioned so have immediately sent off abstract of will copy of edgar tunstall letter be much gratified when in due time mr tunstall have presented at office have personally announced arrival be indeed relief to for have not arrived various difficulty must have arisen a to moiety of estate there being provision in will a to what be to be done must refuse to accept moreover application must have be made to court for appointment of fresh guardian for boy altogether be glad that business might have be troublesome be satisfactorily settled mr tunstall after introducing have produced letter have received from brother with abstract of will copy of letter have sent have said smilingly know whether be sufficient gentleman for be not up in english law if be necessary can of course get dozen witness from state to prove have be always known a william tunstall though generally passed a be custom there under variety of nickname such a english bill stiff bill whole lot of others will naturally take little time great expense to get witness over especially a men be earning pretty high wage in california at present of course can be managed if necessary see that there be necessity for mr randolph said besides doubt will find plenty of people here to identify know that mr randolph see be little more than boy when went away have be at rugby for year often did not come home for holiday twenty year have completely changed in appearance own have very faint recollection of byrneside of course remember house stable ground a to neighbour recollect of brother dined in parlour when father have dinner party seems to that after best proof of identity be correspondence with brother certainly must not have be deceived by stranger fact that exchanged letter occasionally for year seems to definite proof that recognized a brother undoubtedly so mr randolph said that in be strongest proof can be brought mentioned that in letter to mr campbell in san francisco doubt appeared to may say to be absurd not altogether absurd mr randolph california have be turned pretty well topsy turvy during last four five year be not to be blamed for being suspicious may ask if have come across letter to brother among paper have not done so in fact brother told that have not preserved for a be wandering about constantly address gave be benefit that beyond fact that be in california have idea where must be found be why became necessary to advertise for be unfortunate that did not keep mr randolph for in case of course must have told most of content must have be additional proof of identity there be not least occasion for mr tunstall be perfectly entirely satisfied mr edgar recognition of a brother possession of letter fact that answered at once to advertisement in california knowledge of early life at rugby so on tend to one plain conclusion in fact shadow of doubt be entertained by son from first congratulate very heartily on return because to extent very hard treatment be dealt to by father mr philip tunstall have now be atoned for of course only received short abstract of brother will various property fall to be detailed in full in byrneside go to son against may be set off sum invested in good security equal to value of house home park so that can either build purchase mansion a good a byrneside may tell also that estate be added to in father time that other property have be bought by brother who owing to death of wife state of health have for year led very secluded life investing greater part of saving in land so that in fact moiety of estate will be quite a large a elder son portion might have expected to receive in ordinary course of event what sort of boy be nephew mr randolph have seen two three time when have be over at byrneside of course did not notice particularly be bright lad promise to grow into very fine young man fancy from something father let drop that disposition resembles be very fond of outdoor exercise know foot of hill round byrneside though eleven twelve year old be perfectly at home on horseback be good shot have in fact run little wild father spoke of a being warmhearted of excellent impulse lamented that like be somewhat quick tempered headstrong edgar ought not to have selected for guardian mr randolph said almost a much mr tunstall when drew out will mr edgar remarked that have doubtless got over long ago must be able to make more allowance for to manage far better than anyone else must do will try merit edgar confidence mr randolph have suffered enough from headstrong temper have certainly learnt to control will not be hard upon never fear be going over to byrneside at once mr tunstall will go up to london to morrow morning want regular outfit before present there for inspection besides must rather that must give notice to at byrneside have returned be unpleasant to arrive at place unannounced to have to explain who be perhaps must like to see will go through schedule not at mr randolph there will be plenty of time for after return will excuse asking if want money for present use mr tunstall thank be amply provided be doing very well at digging when letter called away have plenty of cash for present purpose will hope dine with to day mr tunstall thank must have be very happy have wife with have left at 'bull oh indeed be not aware that be married yes have be married for year did not think necessary to mention to edgar a must only have used a additional argument why must accept generous offer will be very glad mr randolph if will bring mr tunstall with so mr tunstall came be dark woman a mr randolph wife agreed be probably of mexican spanish blood spoke english with strange accent have evidently at one time be strikingly pretty though now faded have rather worn hard expression on face impressed mr randolph wife son daughter in law le favourably than lawyer have thought right to say to who made inquiry about have a said spoken little have seemed somewhat nervous ill at ease mr tunstall did not appear for time at byrneside went down to rugby to see nephew who have in accordance with father wish be placed there month two after death holiday be to begin week later hugh be delighted when uncle told that aunt be thinking of going to continent for few month before settling down

teach pistol shooting hugh most mexican woman can use pistol in case of need can not shoot a doe can teach to shoot fairly after that be merely matter of incessant practice if ever travel daresay will find very useful to be able to use pistol cleverly there be two three revolver upstairs plenty of ammunition so if like will practise in conservatory be too cold to go out have better go ask james to give thick plank five six of to set up a target if have got thing a iron plate will be better still want to spoil picture place be forty foot long will be long enough range to begin with hour later sharp crack of revolver rang out in conservatory from time to end of holiday hugh practised for two three hour day carrier bringing over fresh supply of ammunition twice week found at first that sharp recoil of revolver rendered very difficult for to shoot straight in time became accustomed to at end of fortnight must put shot in close to spot have marked a bull eye after first day aunt laid aside

flash of lightning suppose be ever going to west aunt still must like to be able to shoot like for if one doe thing at one like to do well illustration hugh practice shooting with revolver so to end of holiday revolver practice went on steadily morning hugh generally firing seventy eighty cartridge must not do at first for wrench of recoil strained wrist gained strength a went on before went back to school thought that be becoming very fair shot although aunt assured that have hardly begun to shoot according to western notion mr tunstall have one day year before driven over to carlisle somewhat to surprise of mr randolph have called upon at office mr randolph began know anything about english law want to ask question certainly dear madam if married woman be to leave sealed letter in hand of lawyer must retain possession of for even if husband called upon to give up be nice question mr tunstall if lawyer be acting a fiduciary agent of lady must at rate see that wish be complied with whether must absolutely hold paper against husband claim be point upon be not prepared at present to give answer anyhow there be way of evading law for instance must pas on to third party then unless husband have be absolutely informed by wife that have handed over document to husband must be powerless lawyer must simply declare that have such document be asking for own sake mr tunstall in interest of friend in own interest mr randolph have written paper here have not signed yet because believe be necessary to sign paper in presence of witness depends upon nature of paper mr tunstall in case be prudent step for then question a to authenticity can arise be not necessary for witness of signature to read content of document by mean simply witness signature well mr randolph be document want to leave in safe hand so that can be opened after death unless previously request not by letter by word of mouth that must be returned to know of one else to whom must commit paper be in opinion very important one only question be whether a be mr tunstall solicitor must like to take frankly without knowing nature of content mr tunstall must certainly prefer not to undertake such charge must remain in hand rather in hand of firm for may sincerely trust that there must be occasion for opening until very many year after death might be found to contain instruction must hardly be carried out by firm situated a be with regard to mr tunstall see that mr randolph there be pause then lawyer said will be going up to town shortly mr tunstall yes in course of month so will be passing through london with hugh will matter keep until then certainly there be great hurry about wish packet placed in safe hand where must be opened in event of death unless recall before in case mr tunstall will give address of firm who do london business be old established firm of highest respectability document will be perfectly safe in hand until demand back until hear of demise will give letter of introduction to accordingly when mr tunstall went up to town next time with hugh called upon firm of solicitor whose place of business be in essex street upon reading mr randolph letter stated that be wife of one of client gentleman of mean be courteously received at once agreed to take charge of document might place in hand upon understanding that if did not write call for must be opened when heard of death content whatever might be acted upon will stand in position of client mr tunstall will do in power to carry out wish a expressed in document whatever may be be unusual matter for will to be left with under precisely similar circumstance if packet must be opened under condition name mr tunstall said will probably not regret having undertaken charge for can assure that may put considerable amount of business in hand how will know of death mr randolph successor must inform of course will request to do so a soon a know of event mr tunstall added be of utmost importance that paper must be opened a soon a possible after death will request mr randolph to inform by telegraph immediately receives news pardon look well healthy be young to be making such careful provision for event may be far distant may may not be far distant said for certain important reason wish to be prepared for at point will now sign in presence mr curtice have not yet put signature to very well mr tunstall two of clerk will witness signature may be many year before question a to authenticity of signature may arise so will be witness also document be lengthy one written on sixteen page of foolscap two of clerk be called in now if will turn last page down mr tunstall so that content can not be seen can sign name will witness be done now mr tunstall if will put sheet of brown paper over other sheet place initial on margin at bottom will put ours so that question can arise a to whole of forming part of document signed by now madam if will fold up place in envelope will attach seal presume carry seal sir think must be more satisfactory that must affix seal of sort matter how common thing may be mr carter will go up into strand with lady take to shop where can purchase seal doe not matter what be mr tunstall common thing with bird motto anything else upon thing be not cut in duplicate therefore if seal envelope in two three place with take seal away with will be guarantee to must ever require to be returned that have not be opened in meantime will get small strong box similar to see round room have name painted on when be completed will put envelope in lock up place in strong room downstairs seal be purchased fixed mr tunstall took departure satisfied that have left document in safe hand mr curtice talked matter over with partner latter laughed woman love little mystery curtice suppose have got little property in own right doe not mean to leave to husband be afraid may get hold of will find out how have left think be that mr curtice said although of course may be must say be foreigner spaniard italian spoke with slight accent besides thing extends over sixteen page of foolscap be likely enough if made will herself curtice may have gone into whole history a to why have not left money to husband possibly think so mark word harris if packet ever come to be opened there will be rum disclosure in that woman be fool there be doubt about being thoroughly in earnest said be likely to give work when be opened believe will write letter to randolph ask to give few particular about client have introduced to when received mr randolph reply stating briefly history of mr william husband of lady have introduced to mr curtice be more convinced than before that delivery of packet into charge be not mere freak offered to bet partner new hat that document be not merely will that must turn out something altogether unusual mr randolph congratulated on forethought when year after mr tunstall visit mr tunstall came into office be just on way up to town said wish must let have couple of hundred in advance on next rent certainly mr tunstall have already have l on know yes know have be little unlucky lately have got account want to settle by way said carelessly a placed bank note in pocket book mr tunstall asked to get from letter packet left in charge letter mr tunstall think there must be mistake mr tunstall have certainly left nothing

commission wanted to execute for in london suppose got mixed up together daresay be of consequence one way other well thanks for money now be off be very much afraid that william tunstall be liar mr

get like way have fallen into of spending time going about country to race course believe have be at home two month year besides sounded last time be here about raising few thousand on mortgage be not turning out well thought when first came back that wandering have done harm doubt have be prepossessed in favour by refusal to accept edgar offer to divide rent with be too hasty be afraid there will be trouble at byrneside be very fortunate edgar put name in a trustee for son so that share of property be safe happens to other hate to see man of good old family like tunstalls going wrong wonder what mysterious document wife wanted to leave with be must be something of great importance must never have come to lied in order to get into hand be queer business hugh did not see uncle when be at

carlisle must be known a northern train be nearly due someone answering to description have taken ticket to glasgow must be at once suspected that intended to sail by steamer from port pursuit must be set on foot before morning indeed be probable that before police took matter fairly in hand must be late in afternoon might then be day before picked up clue that have gone to glasgow followed there if steamer have happened to start that morning day before must be supposed that have gone by might telegraph across search ship for when arrived at new york if steamer have started must obtain clue to

understood what said mule threw weight on trace broke into slow trot crack of driver whip woke leader into activity pace be not kept up long for ground have now begun to rise presently entered valley between two spur of hill soon began to mount by rough road became steeper steeper hugh be glad to get off walk in front at time track have to cross be bare rock so smooth slippery that animal must scarcely keep foot drag up waggon then wound along on side of hill ground on one side being so much higher than on other that seemed to hugh that loaded waggon must infallibly topple over go rolling down into valley below sometimes descended sharply into lateral ravine cut by stream climbed up other side hill now be covered with growth of small tree brushwood larger timber have already be felled at last waggon turned up bed of stream running through rocky gorge here be driver said fifty yard further came upon saw mill roughly built structure with water wheel low log hut stood beside beyond valley opened out at upper end side far up hill be covered with tree woodman axe have already stripped lower part of valley of timber tree dam have be built across stream leat cut to water wheel be sunk five six foot below level of ground around tail race continued nearly down to mouth of gorge where water fell again into old bed of stream wheel be revolving sound of machinery inside mill

screw jack until level with saw bench here be packed up jack then taken to other end machinery consisted solely of one large circular saw of of smaller size water power must not have be sufficient to drive frame saw whole work have to be done with circular saw mill be not large sufficed for want of m'kinney neighbourhood two waggon load of plank be sent down daily three axemen who felled squared tree teamster with four horse to drag balk down to mill completed establishment hugh soon found that work be far more interesting than have be in woodyard needed good deal of skill to handle heavy piece of timber get upon saw bench although be cross cut by woodman into length suitable for plank then great saw cut balk into plank three inch wide be taken to smaller saw ran down into half three quarter inch plank a required bench be of primitive description balk being laid on fixed roller necessary movement given to by rope passed through block taken round shaft a revolved wound up rope brought log forward against saw noise at first of saw of water wheel machinery almost deafened hugh soon ceased to notice found that duty be of general kind assisted in raising log to place in getting properly placed on roller then helped to fix block pulley to remove plank a be cut off to work log back to place in readiness for plank to be cut from small saw required one man constant attention a three inch plank be simply pushed forward by hand against being kept in true position by guide have got to be careful when get near end foreman said to will find without finger two in time when get to within foot of end must not push plank further go to other end of saw pull to be pretty rough business altogether will only last few month there be not enough tree to supply longer than pawson have bought up place bit further among hill have ordered better plant than reckons will be up ready to run by time be done here place ai fit for carrying on much trade when be put up two year ago there be few people about on plain waggon load week be about outside pawson must get rid of have be here from first in day used to work with rifle handy for there be always chance of attack by indian country

out of way forty foot be right length will splice one end into eye for other go through make running noose when throw loop be three four foot across of course better can throw smaller can have loop smaller be better for jerk come quicker before horse steer be prepared for now see that stump of young tree sticking up two foot above ground well form loop gather rest in coil in hand like stand to begin with twenty foot away cast loop over stump so of evening when supper be over hugh went out practised with rope at end of month found that must throw at distance of thirty foot with fair certainty of dropping loop over stump also took royce advice a to pistol have laid by since arriving at m'kinney now got belt similar to worn by cow boy took to carrying pistol in unloaded at odd moment practised drawing from belt levelling pulling trigger with greatest possible speed action seemed simple enough be surprised to find how with practice time taken in doing diminished finger came to close upon handle in exactly right position almost instantaneously a hand shot out thumb drew back hammer forefinger closed on trigger have practised before more le when have learned to use weapon in conservatory at byrneside at time have not appeared probable accomplishment must be of use now knew that life might depend upon came in time to be able to perform with a royce have said something

for few minute before try again hugh thought advice good after fastening up horse stood watching man called broncho breaker who be fighting one of most vicious of last year horse have not seen hugh must not have believed possible that horse must go through such performance have ridden many vicious brute at home have thought that knew something of horse be new experience for in rearing kicking plunging there be nothing novel a horse be much smaller than english hunter to have be accustomed felt that if have be all must have difficulty in keeping seat bucking be new to to perform be necessary that horse must be able to get head down moment be done sprang straight into air at same moment rounding back with sharp sudden jerk that fairly threw rider into air on coming down animal kept leg stiff so that jerk to rider be scarcely le than of upward spring before have time to settle in slightest horse repeated performance varying occasionally by springing sideways backwards forward breaker a be generally called broncho buster kept figure perfectly upright with tremendous grip upon saddle with thigh depending a hugh must see rather upon balance than upon hold exertion be evidently great man hat have be jerked off perspiration stood upon bronzed forehead from time to time dug spur into animal flank excited to continue desperate effort until at last horse be utterly exhausted stood with head drooping unable to make effort there be shout of applause from cow boy looking on bully for jake be brute be mistake will give turn day for week jake said be worth taking trouble with will take for gallop to morrow do buck when be galloping hugh asked cow boy next to latter nodded not when be going at best pace have time to do then when be going at hand gallop will do wait until be off guard then up go in air come down perhaps three yard sideways be fifty to one against being on back when do come down see how be done now though see how can do hugh said will try again illustration next jump threw fairly over horse head horse be led out hugh again mounted time be prepared for what be to come in spite of grip with leg blow lifted far above saddle seemed to that next buck came before have fairly descended for struck with force suddenness of electric shock again again be thrown up until felt balance going next jump threw fairly over horse head a be prepared for fall be much le heavy than first time well done well done several of cow boy said a rose to foot will do will make good rider before long will do for to day must not try more be going to try until can sit hugh said have got to do may a well go on now before get stiff broncho breaker came up to a after waiting minute two to get breath again prepared to mount keep back so stiff young fellow just let back go a if there be bone in have known man spine broke before now by bucker sit easy lissom keep head be principal thing ai easy when be being pitched up down like ball turn upon that let leg close on tight time come down if only for moment save from being thrown clean away from hugh sprang on to horse struggle again began ended like last hugh have kept seat somewhat longer than before again again tried time with more success fifth time felt that horse action be le sudden violent that be becoming fatigued with tremendous exertion now brute muttered be turn dug spur into horse spring more violent than have yet felt followed application for minute two be almost bewildered by force rapidity of animal spring be now confident that be gaining mastery moment found that effort be decreasing again applied spur response be le vigorous than before in five minute animal stood exhausted subdued cheer broke from cow boy who be standing round looking on at struggle well done young fellow be toughest tender foot have ever seen one of said shaking by hand believe there be ten men in camp who must have sat horse a have say that be very first time have be on bucker have beaten hugh said have pretty well beaten must help off saddle for feel a if back be broken must not lift leg over saddle if life depended on two cow boy lifted from seat be hard tussle mate broncho breaker said coming up to have stuck to well be clear grit be best thing can do be to walk about for next hour just keep moving then go wrap up in two three blanket lie down in bunk for bit have thorough good sweat then strip rub down get mate to rub back well then dress move about great thing be not to get stiff will feel for day two hugh followed advice found hard work to do so be bruised over with fall scarce seemed able to put one leg before at movement sharp pain shot through loin felt a if spine have be dislocated still for hour walked about at end of time felt that movement be more easy then went to hut wrapped in bill blanket own presently dozed off to sleep couple of hour later woke saw bill standing beside now hugh have better turn out let give rub just take off shirt have got lump of hog grease here hugh got out of bunk with difficulty took off shirt now lean hand on bunk arch back be now here go for good half hour bill worked at back kneading with knuckle down side of spine across loin now will do said at last put on dry shirt come out hugh strolled down to stock yard felt wonderfully better after rubbing be able to walk with far greater ease than before scene in yard be unchanged fresh group of horse have be driven in a fast a others have be saddled mounted by nightfall of cow boy have be provided with three horse hugh be greatly amused at scene for spill be numerous shouting laughter incessant next day work of breaking in broncho commenced one after be roped dragged out of drove bridle be slipped on be then blindfolded while saddle be put on fastened then jake mounted cloth be drawn off animal head struggle commenced horse tried mean to unseat rider in vain submitted after comparatively short struggle others fought long desperately a soon a first victory be won bar be let down horse be taken for long gallop across country returning home subdued trembling then process be repeated with fresh animal how long doe take to break asked cow boy three day generally sometimes will ride four five time three be generally enough then be handed over to to finish must take lot out of hugh said must be better to do more gradually see be scared nearly to death before be begun with can not afford time man said get two dollar horse for breaking will be here for fortnight in time will do pretty well hundred then will go off somewhere else must be tremendous work for hugh said be that bet broncho buster seldom last above two year get shaken to piece clean broke up by end of time a fast a horse be broken in be handed over to cow boy hugh who have be unable to do work for two day then began to break in lot be to be particular property be fond of horse must not bring to use such violent measure a saw adopted by companion first lesson taught be to stand still moment rope fell over neck animal be led up to stump of tree then loosed at once went off at full speed a did so owner threw noose of rope over head then gave other end turn round stump shock be tremendous horse being frequently jerked right over on to back two three experience of sort be sufficient animal thenceforth learned to stand not only when rope be thrown round neck even when rein be dropped upon so that when master dismounted remained perfectly quiet until again mounted took rein in hand even if be absent considerable time a team be to start in few day on round up hugh felt that must be useless for to attempt to break horse in by english method be therefore obliged to adopt in use by companion mollified however to extent by getting rope tying to own then took only turn round stump let rope run out at first fast checking gradually until pressure upon neck brought animal half suffocated to stop took longer to accomplish object found that by end of week seven horse have learned lesson having be ridden for hour day have have several severe battle with animal have first mounted be by far most vicious of struggle day have become le severe a horse recognized futility of endeavouring to unseat master hugh have many fall during schooling be upon whole well satisfied with result several of cow boy have advised to use method adopted for securing in seat upon specially vicious horse one of method be fastening of loop of leather to high pommel holding in hand be well nigh impossible to be bucked from saddle there be disadvantage if strap broke nothing must save rider from fall far more violent heavy than came from being pitched from saddle in ordinary way method be to fasten strap passed under horse belly tightly below knee although held rider in saddle have serious disadvantage in event of horse rearing falling back of falling headlong from putting foot in hole rider must not free be almost certain to be crushed under horse others again fastened by bringing foot together crossing spur under horse belly safer measure than last objectionable inasmuch a spur when animal bucked struck in belly so increased violence of action of course best rider refrained from using of method trusting only to leg grip to balance hugh determined to ride in way even if did cost few more fall be on excellent term with rest of cow boy tender foot a new comer be called be always subject of endless prank annoyance if evinces least timidity nervousness if on other hand show that have pluck determination to succeed good temper be treated with kindness cordiality hugh exhibition therefore of courage horsemanship on occasion of first attempt at once won liking admiration be ready to lend hand when necessary to give hint advice be free from of annoyance to new hand be often exposed there be several other tender foot among party two three of got on fairly soon ceased to be butt rest before week be up found work altogether too trying one after went off in

winter scattered to great distance in search of better grazing ground shelter in more northern range when snow storm with violent wind swept down from north west cattle must drift before always keeping head from wind feeding a travelled sometimes great herd must thus travel hundred of mile until brought up by obstacle at time such thing a fence be absolutely unknown on plain when year after

make blaze up went ten pace away held up between finger thumb broncho harry shattered with bullet then broncho went same distance out turned sideways long tom smashed bowl of pipe must like to have try hugh asked thank broncho daresay might hit pipe if be fixed at distance must not try when be within three inch of nose for anything will come in time hugh be just nerve must mind holding out to now must not be bit afeard then sat down to fire again hugh heard many anecdote of marvellous shooting hitherto have borne no nickname being only one in camp addressed by simple name found next morning that have be re christened henceforward be always addressed a lightning illustration illustration chapter ix round up day by day herd swelled at end of two month began to move in direction of general rendezvous hugh have soon taken share in night guarding of cattle found fascinating work broncho harry generally worked together first watch be preferred because allowed fair night rest to be taken afterwards at same time work be far harder more arduous than in later watch cattle be still on foot when watch began on reaching two guard began to ride round round going in opposite direction for time cattle must go on feeding then gradually must lie down until perhaps five six be on ground at time however slightest noise must bring on to foot again then group must try to leave mass to begin to feed again cow boy have to drive in upon dark night depended more upon horse sight than own for must of own accord leave close packed circle strike out to turn back animal have wandered from at last after hour two herd must subside cow boy must flatter that work be done then one of cattle lying outside must leap to foot with snort alarmed perhaps by sudden scamper of inquisitive jack rabbit having come up to examine what be going on have fled at approach of one of cow boy with loud snort whole herd must then spring to foot perhaps after time herd must lie down again reassured by song of cow boy who from time came on duty always continued to sing unless played on fife other musical instrument answered a well a voice at other time sort of general agitation communicated to herd on outside finding unable to leave mass owing to vigilance of guard must begin to move along edge motion must spread in short time whole mass be circling a cow boy call weaving a action unless checked always terminated in general stampede duty of cow boy be at once to check must only be done by wedging into mass shouting using heavy whip to break up put stop to motion be dangerous work not only from pressure from sea of horn angry tossing head sometimes must be successful sometimes must fail above lowing bellowing there must be thunder of hoof on side opposite to on be engaged then must rise shout of be off cow boy must edge horse out of mass one on flank gallop at top of speed to head animal back a soon a came near head of herd must yell shout at top of voice sometimes discharging pistol in air pressing animal on flank gradually inward so checking speed of whole until at last met in front of herd sometimes must succeed before two three mile of ground be passed over sometimes wild flight of herd must not be checked before morning when must be thirty forty mile away from starting place if unable to stop great aim of cow boy be to keep in one body in case great trouble resulted from stampede other men must be out in morning herd must be driven back to starting place if herd broke up a be sometimes case scattered over country might take many day of hard work before must again be got together if night set in wild so a to render probable that cattle must stampede third man be placed on guard must aid in keeping in a long a possible if broke circle went off duty be to gallop back to camp cow boy there must leap to foot in instant run to horse picketed near saddled bridled ready for instant use throw on back gallop off at top of speed in direction in herd have gone thunder storm be of not infrequent occurrence when cloud be seen banking up before sunset lightning began to play cattle guard knew that be in for troubled night long before storm approached close enough to cause actual alarm among cattle must evince sign of uneasiness electrical condition of air seeming to affect might lie down be only to rise again distant roll of thunder seemed to be answered by restless bellowing on night needed message to camp to bring up help a storm approached became evident by brightness rapidity of flash that be going to be unusually severe one one by one men must leave fire rise from couch go out to horse pull up coil rope leap into saddle wrap blanket round gallop off to herd beginning always to sing a approached a otherwise arrival might stampede animal when storm came overhead terror of cattle rose to highest point effort of whole of cow boy of outfit scarcely sufficed to restrain almost incessant flash of lightning showed sea of head horn wild eye distended nostril thunder be continuous so terrible be of storm hugh felt grateful to animal that trouble gave incessant effort activity required to restrain diverted attention from terrible war of element overhead on night be almost certain that sooner later herd must stampede once off effort of guard be directed to keep together rather than to head so long a remained in bunch mattered little whether be one mile thirty from camp if headed held up must probably start again be le anxious work to gallop by side of frightened mass than to hold in check when once excitement reached height in respect ride in such storm a be le dangerous than upon dark still night for lightning flash showed not only exact position of herd greatly diminished chance of serious fall by lighting up whole configuration of country showing obstacle in way even fall heavy though might be must be trifle in comparison to one occurring while endeavouring to head herd for in case must entail certain death a life must be trampled out in instant by onward torrent of cattle hugh have by time come to understand that even twelve horse be by mean too much for use of man wiry tough a be pony men who rode seemed to be iron hugh be frequently in saddle eighteen hour day occasionally twenty four even five horse must be thoroughly done up before work be over have be fed with grain smaller number might have sufficed for unless unusually pressed must have be ridden again on following day fed entirely upon dry grass of plain needed day rest before be again fit for work herd increased by thousand before reached general rendezvous of round up for day six of men scoured country lying within ten fifteen mile of line of march drove in cattle met with on way at last reached stream near whose bank vast herd driven in from quarter be gathered there have be occasional day halt on way to give needed rest to cattle horse men now that outfit have arrived at spot indicated before have left headquarters station there be rest for four day before operation commenced time be employed by men in washing overhauling mending clothes repairing saddle in sleep knew nothing of position of other outfit of own of other ranch be sure that lay within radius of twenty thirty mile be to say have a yet arrived have probably come up day before perhaps week others must not be there for time depended upon nature of country to be worked distance traversed there be several other outfit scattered along bank of stream above below at distance of about mile apart overseer of different ranch be busy making arrangement for general campaign four day after arrival cow boy rode in with letter to overseer of outfit few minute later broncho harry four other hand among whom be hugh bill royce be ordered to saddle up to go down to central

do so so will saddle up do so so be just a easy to put in form a in other though cow boy know that if doe not comply with request have got to ride back to headquarters station get money doe not feel dignity injured a must be by direct order there be men more independent than cow boy know value really good man know be more especially case at time that have to ride to next ranche to get employment consequence be that although willing to work to utmost of power in interest of employer by mean regard employer a master treat even chief manager on term of absolute equality insists upon being so treated by in return broncho harry overseer said want jack johnson bowie bob chunky royce lightning hugh to saddle up ride down to fork help in round up waggon be going to stay here till herd be

strong post six foot high placed at interval of two three inch apart have be built three four year before a place be most convenient central upon plain few waggon load of timber have be taken out there fortnight before arrival of team with gang of men who took up post showed sign of rottenness replaced by others various ranch in round up performing duty by turn fence inclosed space of upwards of acre beside contingent from brand circle triangle ranche forty fifty cow boy from other ranch be gathered within several fire be lighted for heating brand overseer who be in charge of work for day divided men into party group consisting of representative of four five different ranch in short time great herd be seen approaching driven in by number of mounted cow boy cross bar be removed from opening served a gate at upper end of yard reluctant animal unable to withstand pressure of behind poured in several hundred entered bar be dropped again animal inclosed stood in dense group stamping ground threatening attack a cow boy approached illustration branding calf at round up carried rope holding in hand ready for throwing while others have coiled over left shoulder while in right hand held heavy whip who be to fetch out calf first approached half dozen rope be thrown calf be dragged out struggling calling a cow boy called bawling to mother for assistance call be not in vain cow rushed out furiously to assistance of calf a did so cow boy whose comrade be dragging calf towards one of fire shouted out brand on cow then cracking whip if necessary using drove animal back into mass kept there while calf be thrown down branded with same mark a mother hugh be among told off to fetch out calf have have practice a many of maverick found have calf by side a well a cow have be branded with brand circle triangle cow boy assisted to haul calf by main force towards fire held rope while hugh ran up to placing beside leaned over grasped by flank with hand then lifted flung down on side comrade then ran up pinned head to ground while hugh knelt on haunch brander came up with hot iron marked iron be held on long enough only to burn off hair slightly singe hide mark so made be almost indelible in addition to calf ear be cut ranche having particular mark such a two long slit short one square piece cut out notch on side of semicircular piece two notch semicircle square c mark be very durable even often became confused owing to ear getting torn by rush through thorn by action of neighbour horn in close press during stampede required small exercise of strength to throw calf of three month old many of be eight nine month nearly full grown needed great exertion of strength good deal of knack to throw down animal of size once twice hugh have narrow escape for of cow in spite of cow boy whip burst through rushed to assistance of calf time rope descended over head caught by leg threw to ground before reached after hour of work be relieved by one of other men took turn of lighter work of keeping back cow when calf in yard have be branded gate at lower end be opened animal driven out while fresh mob be admitted from herd so work went on until herd have passed through

altogether harry back loin feel a if have be beaten to pulp believe have strained muscle of arm hand wrist be so stiff that ca close finger yes calf chucking be pretty hard work until get accustomed to cow boy said be knack more than strength though need lot of strength too when have got rampagious ten month calf in hand have not got knack yet hugh said anything over six month have to have roped by leg thrown suppose will be able to tackle in time in case of cow have be branded only year two before there be difficulty in recognizing brand so to decide upon ownership of calf in case of older cow brand ear mark have in instance become so far obliterated that be difficult to decide what have originally be over brand there be sharp sometimes angry dispute among cow boy belonging to different ranch case be generally settled by overseer in charge of day operation calling upon three cow boy belonging to ranch unconnected with dispute to give opinion a to what mark have originally be decision be accepted by party a final cow rebranded a well a calf what do do when brand be so far gone a to make altogether impossible to say what be hugh asked must not get here at in state cow boy replied must have be rebranded at once by outfit that first found just a if have be maverick in case of course cow boy must claim cow a belonging to ranche if must convince others that old brand be one used by never brand over old mark must be left a evidence next day happened to be sunday hugh felt glad indeed that have day on to recover from stiffness sunday be always kept except in case of great emergency a day of rest cow boy taking opportunity to wash mend clothes to practise shooting with revolver to run race with horse at round up race afford one of chief interest to cow boy for rivalry between various ranch run high men be ready to bet bottom dollar upon representative of own ranche have ever tried that horse of yours against anything fast hugh one of comrade asked be sure be very

match be good horse of yours mean one first mounted who played such trick with must like day to try against best see how go daresay will get again before round up be over what length do run race here broncho in general be short dash not above mile at outside sometimes match be made for distance well when have have dinner will trot out into plain must go off goodish bit make sure that none of boy of other ranch be within sight accordingly when dinner be over broncho harry hugh went out to horse prince come trotting out a soon a heard hugh whistle broncho harry soon dropped noose over neck of own horse then put on saddle bridle have brought with went off at canter across plain ran three four trial result showed that broncho horse be quicker in getting off that in quarter of mile dash there be little to choose between at longer distance than prince be in spite of greater weight carried much faster that horse can go cow boy said admiringly must mind if there be pack of redskin coming behind if be on back worst of be be so good looking if be ugly to look at might clean out camp look so good that be afraid sha' be able to get much money out of well now wo race evening there be sure to be match on will ride horse way will find what there be in camp whether there be anything can beat a much a horse can do go cavorting about on just let run with rest of mob then wo be noticed there

yard if make match against must see that ai le than mile next morning work in stock yard be resumed continued throughout week illustration chapter x race think broncho hugh said one evening must do anything more about race if be if do lay out money on there be just a much interest in race if be for dollar two a if boy in outfit piled money upon horse beat yours pretty easily quite a easy must say a prince must beat for distance really think that prince must have pull of in race of length have on here in twenty mile gallop feel sure must leave anything in camp behind easily certainly must not race long distance of sort if have troop of indian after prince must have to do best whether be twenty mile fifty must not press when be merely question of making money on horse be beaten of

not likely must travel for many hour that evening knew that prince who have have easy time of lately must easily do greatly preferred keeping for felt that upon expedition a speed might be of greatest utility rapid ride of ten mile up valley took to mouth of canyon came into main valley at sharp angle be wide at entrance soon narrowed down into gorge from ten to twenty foot wide with rock rising precipitously on side be evident by smoothly worn face that in wet season tremendous torrent rushed down filling thirty forty foot deep be perfectly dry now for most part be able to ride at fair pace here there however mass of rock have fallen down from above since last rain here have to dismount allow horse to clamber over by a best must at such spot scratch upon face of stone showed where party be pursuing have passed on previous day canyon be upwards of mile in length valley into led be hundred of foot higher than have left a soon a emerged from pas put horse into gallop track of party before being plainly visible a got deeper among mountain scenery became very wild forest clothed hill great mass of rock towered above valley huge block of stone encumbered route have to pursue sometimes track left bottom wound up hillside passing at time along ledge with precipice above below anxious a be to press forward much of journey have to be performed at foot pace for many of horse having be brought up on plain life be fidgety nervous on such unaccustomed ground required coaxing care to get along pass travelled until late in afternoon then halted next day work be of same character be now high up among hill steve told that be near crest of range have better stop here rutherford said about three o'clock in afternoon a arrived at little stream must knock critter up have done good day work already have gained upon steve broncho harry said trace have be getting fresher yes have gained bit not very much horse must go faster than ours because be accustomed to mountain cattle will have kept back why stop here be because there be sort of wall of rock with passage up through mile two ahead though expect have idea be followed be like enough to have left sentry on top of wall 'ud never do for to attack here must have show at want to get girl back throwing away life ai way to do be careful how pick wood for fire boy must let smoke go curling up have got to see bit put on be a dry a chip how on earth do indian manage to live among hill hugh asked after meal have be cooked eaten country be different on other side jim gattling said be pretty nearly up to top of

jim say there be wide sort of plateau with big valley down to canadian ai very far now from frontier of new mexico from top of hill here can see spanish peak hundred fifty mile away reckon may have to go down side there be heap of injun village up here though may thrash lot ahead of must gather pretty thick in short time like enough cut off going back for know track better than do horse must go at gallop along place where must have to drag ours going down other way can ride a fast a can when once get down in valley of canadian will get help at ranch there will certainly be best way steve broncho harry said be ready to fight number of on plain must be good to be hemmed up among hill with chance of help must keep off reckon till have eaten boot must make end of at last sure have often be along line before steve once came across here with party of red skin just after last peace wur made with when be sure that must break out again until have got present have got stock of bead looking glass cotton such like went up with couple of mule traded among for skin worked robe moccasin indian trumpery sent back east did pretty good trade with know other side well be ranching two year down on canadian have two three fight with red skin who be pretty troublesome about time there be many ranch down there then have to look pretty spry to keep har on head how do propose to work now steve well reckon that if have got sentry on rock spoke of wo stay there after dark that danger will be at other end of pas like enough there will be one two of there reckon best plan will be for jim gattling kipple of others to go on ahead quiet if find of skunk there in course will wipe out when have done that rest can come up pas ai place for anyone a doe know foot of way to come up in dark must make torch ready to light up when one of go back with news that pas be clear a soon a have done with red skin jim will go off scouting see know yet what band be how far village be away will follow on trail when rest get up through pas must just wait till bring word reckon from coming by road a place be about fifteen mile from top of pas there be big village there expect belong to reckon be just getting there now will be feasting pretty considerable to night air pity ai handy however can not be helped must risk if be to try to push on afore got dark plan seems to pan out right steve who will take with waal long tom may a well come broncho though reckon make much difference for mean fighting a soon a became dusk party again moved forward be rock rutherford said pointing to long dark line rose up before ca see here reckon if there wur scout there have moved off before now do other fellow take critter just move on slowly see that point sticking up above line waal be on one side of pas so just make for stop when get there till one of come back torch have be prepared during halt two three young pitch pine having be cut down split up for purpose four scout moved off at quick walk rest of party picked way along slowly cautiously towards point steve have indicated have little trouble in finding entrance to pas when discovered threw bridle on horse neck dismounted time went slowly be not more than two hour before heard slight noise up pas minute two later footfall be that broncho hugh asked air be same thing reckon jehoshaphat have knocked pretty nigh to piece among blessed rock air just a dark a cave there ai no seeing hand well be all right tom ai gone off right when got to top of pas there wur two red skin sitting at fire come along a quiet a must just a got in sight of suppose heard something for jumped on to foot wur out of sight like streak of lightning waited without moving for hour then came back again must have shot steve reckoned be too great risk so jim undertook to crawl forward while broncho wur to keep ready to shoot if redskin made bolt wur long time at least seemed so red skin be restless must see be on listen waal at last up jumped wur too late steve jim fired down went came on wust of business wur that one of ho broke loose bolted steve fired after may have hit may not anyhow went off so now have got to hurry up know torch be at once lit leading horse party made way up gorge be steep narrow encumbered with boulder in hour reached other end broncho harry be awaiting have got to move away to right for about mile stop there there be clump of tree be where be to wait air 'tarnal bad business that air ho getting away be pretty sure to bring injun down on steve ai going very far sez there be village about three mile from one think most likely when get about four mile away from here will be able to see way track go then will come straight back to tree do think hit horse harry hugh asked a made way to clump of tree suppose must miss horse if tried hugh hit sure enough worse luck if have missed must have mattered so much if came galloping in by might have thought have got scared at something by bar perhaps have just made track for camp like enough must have sent off four men to see if wur right when blessed thing turn up with bullet in hide will know there have be fight what do think will do then harry be likely to ride out in force to gap may may not must say wo must guess will just throw out scout round village wait till morning wo know how strong party be must take risk of being ambushed in dark perhaps when horse go in wo notice especially a will be feasting dancing reckon worth cent hugh there be safe to be one two of boy out looking after horse besides varmint ear be always open must hear horse coming at gallop across plain mile away aye more than directly boy see horse be saddled will run in tell then will take in by fire look at when see mark have made on there will be nice rumpus bet will know what mean just a if wur writ down for two hour passed then sound of approaching horse be heard well steve what news horse have gone on straight for village one thought other track go in direction there ai chance of taking by surprise now what do think will do steve will just watch night be sartin in morning two three will be sent out to scout there ai many tree about here will reckon that can see a soon a see send out be safe to be on best horse have got in course must lie down there by gap shoot when come up see a must do good when did get back must only put others more on guard than ever if shoot will find track here take back news how many be tell lad look at a will see way out of what make wuss be when take back news that scout left here have be shot will go mighty hard with captive in village ca see way out of kink anyhow be ready to give life cheerful for rosie ai going to ask to give life when see a there be chance of getting do see way out of job broncho steve a say there be about forty fifty of varmint in expedition may reckon there will be a many more able to draw trigger in village make eighty four to one be pretty long odds if be out in plain might be match for to attack injun camp be waiting ready ai same thing a fighting in plain half of must go down before got in there must not be no more chance of rest of getting captive away than there must if be in moon if have be for affair of ho might have carried out plan might have made way into village there wur just chance that yer might have got out brought along to likely place where be handy there ai no need to talk about now will be guarded that strict that bird must get to with message ai to be thought of can of boy think of anything one spoke then hugh said be only young hand yet know idea be worth anything will tell what be then can improve upon perhaps seems to that in first place ought to leave say four men at gap if four indian scout come out ought to shoot rope three of let fourth escape if there be only two of must let one get away what must do for hugh broncho harry asked in surprise will tell directly broncho rest of except four who be left on watch must start at once make big circuit come round to other side of village stop mile so away in hiding at rate a near a can get why propose letting one go be suppose three four scout go out none return indian will be sure that have fallen in trap somewhere wo know how strong be whether think of making attack on village will stop there expecting for day perhaps then send out scout again now if one get back with news that saw sign of until got close to gap then three four shot be fired comrade be killed got off without being pursued seems to that must naturally imagine that there be only small party at gap perhaps three four men from village attacked who have come out to revenge must send out strong party of brave at once to attack of course four men left at gap must directly have done work indian be out of sight mount horse make same circuit a have done join a quickly a must must be keeping watch after seeing war party ride off must dash straight down into village half perhaps more than half of fighting men will have gone others making sure that be still at gap that there be fear of attack will be careless must be pretty well into village before shot be fired shake young fellow steve rutherford said holding out hand to hugh air judgematical plan if succeed ought ter there be general chorus of assent beat altogether steve went on how yer must have hit on plan like when who have be fighting injun off on for last twenty year must see way more than if have be mole may be young on plain lightning fur so have heard call yer yer must have reasoned out better if yer have be at fifty year tell young fellow if get rosie back agin will be thanks to if time come a yer want man to stand by yer to death yer can count steve rutherford in jim gattling young settler said rosie wur going to get hitched next month need talk to tell yer what feel about of will stay of will go broncho harry said be only man a know country steve so must go sartin long tom will stay here if like can give general direction of village expect can make shift to come round join besides there will be trail to follow reckon will send out scout till daylight anyhow wo start before be safe to be able to follow trail then who will stop with will stay hugh hugh said decidedly will go with steve be not very sure shot with rifle can shoot straight enough broncho harry said well perhaps be that harry so far have have indian fighting though be quite ready to go in do share in fight tell fairly must shoot men down however hostile in cold blood right hugh sha' stay with when know injun a well a do know mercy ai thing a ever enters mind that murder woman child in cold blood that if do take prisoner be just to torture until dy wo feel way will stay with broncho jim gattling said have just seen house burnt best part of stock carried away dozen more of friend killed scalped bet must kill red skin at sight just a must put heel on rattlesnake of party also volunteered to stay at gap further word be necessary party mounted be where village lie broncho just about under star be about fifteen mile a told on straight line will keep over there to right in couple of mile will get to where ground fall will travel along there ca be wrong if keep down on slope there air chance then of being seen know just where will turn off there be several dip run down from above will follow one of up when reckon have got mile two beyond village so keep sharp look out for trail there need bother much about before because ca miss way look sharp at turning must drop something to show where turn off if injun happened to come along must be safe to notice when guess have ridden far enough keep sharp look out for place when turn off then follow trail careful be rolling ground that side of village reckon kin get within mile of there ai much fear of wandering about scout have out wo be on side so long steve rutherford led way there ai no need to hurry said have got plenty of time reckon that when get bit further will dismount lead horse have have pretty hard work coming up hill tell be likely to want speed to morrow of will have to carry double if ca manage to get hold of few of injun pony accordingly after riding for hour party dismounted led horse for long distance be novel exercise to cow boy for be rare for one of to walk hundred yard horse stand ever ready at hand if be only to go down to stream hard by to fetch bucket of water cow boy will always throw leg over horse felt justice of steve remark knew that have at least hundred mile ride before must hope to meet friend that pursuit must be hot be therefore of vital importance that horse must start a fresh a possible after three hour walking mounted again continued way until steve rutherford said that thought have gone far enough now moon have risen at two o'clock light have enabled to travel fast since have remounted turning up hollow followed for about two mile then found be entering hilly rugged country here be steve said village lie at foot of rock know how far along may be be right sure that have got beyond now boy can sleep till daylight will keep watch see that none of horse stray in very few minute be quiet in little valley save for sound of horse cropping short grass at first gleam of daylight rutherford stirred up one of sleeper be going to scout said when others wake tell to be sure not to stir out of dip to mind that horse show on sky line injun will be keeping eye open morning if caught sight of one of critter must just spoil hull plan rutherford be gone two hour long before return men be up about bill royce have gone little farther up valley narrowed to ravine climbing rock cautiously have taken survey of country sign of village said when returned sign of injun a far a can see so think if go up to head of gulch will be safe to make fire cook rest of meat there ai more than enough for one more feed after reckon will have to take to horse flesh now half of will go up cook other half keep watch here may have steve coming back with twenty red skin on track just a have fried meat steve returned be about three mile from village said keeping along at foot of hill can get to within mile of safe beyond that be chance what be doing cooking well one must eat sooner get on better want to watch how thing go a soon a meal be finished party mounted keeping close to foot of hill rode on till steve said can not go beyond next bluff so turn up gulch looked in there be good feed for horse there have better look round when get in to see a there ai bar nothing to scare horse two of yer have best stay on guard here at mouth ef one of critter wur to get loose to scoot out below there life must be worth red cent now stumpy owen will go up over there from among bush just at foot of rock can see camp will take by turn to keep watch if others will take advice will all get a much sleep a can till come for mind keep two on guard here can come with steve hugh asked feel like sleep at can take place lightning royce said ai in hurry to look at injun expect will see plenty of afore have done illustration illustration chapter xiii rescued steve rutherford settler owen hugh made way along at foot of steep rock keeping among fallen boulder stopping at time making close survey of plain to be sure that indian be in sight before moving further be point steve said presently from among rock can get view of village must keep head low lightning not show above rock will be keeping sharp look out like enough must make out lizard moving at distance when reached point made way with extreme care to highest boulder then lying down looked through interstice between hugh started a did so for although indian village be nearly mile away mountain air be so clear that did not seem quarter of distance position be well chosen hill rose almost perpendicularly behind defending from attack on side while in front on side ground sloped away be clear of brushwood inequality must afford shelter to assailant tree stood in around affording shade during heat of day number of horse be grazing close to village with dozen indian boy round in readiness to drive in at shortest notice smoke be curling up from top of wigwam through tree many figure of men woman must be seen moving about how long do think will be steve before scout get back again hour must guess expect started at daybreak anyhow have gone before got here reckon must travel fast going there in first place must scout about look for sign of enemy in second must want to blow horse for might have to ride for life moment must give four hour good two half to get there something over hour for one of to get back again may be here in hour may not be here for hour will be somewhere between one other twenty minute passed then steve exclaimed here come other two caught sight of indian at same moment a first head shoulder then whole rider horse appeared on crest of rise four mile away be a yet invisible from village in few minute must perceive stir there three four warrior ran out from village leaped on to horse galloped out to meet returning scout saw join sweeping round without check accompany in ten minute reached village

waal if have got hostage steve there ai minute to waste here see have figured on hostage see have got meat be good waal be ready because if so let git three minute later party rode away from burning village woman mounted on indian horse thar cattle steve said pointing to herd out on plain ai use thinking of now bet broncho harry replied there ai no thinking about horn hide at present be own har have got to think of think will catch up broncho said steve think nothing at about be just a sure to catch up a sun be to rise have got foot of hundred mile to go horse have be travelling hard for last three day by time fellow a have galloped on ahead be pretty nigh main party if have overtook before have call for speed must be taking easy ca reckon much more than ten mile start still when catch wo be more than three to one there be thirty five went out said steve twenty five in second lot brings up to sixty be pretty nigh three to one well three to one ai such great odds even if wur to come down fight in body reckon must not do that be more likely to make surround of must know that must have to leave pretty near half number to guard woman rest must be strong enough to charge besides ai only sixty have got to reckon with like enough dozen of started a soon a turned back to other village of tribe may reckon will have two three hundred of coming along in track in hour two make mistake about steve sha' get away have got to fight now know country what have got to reckon up be where will fight ca calkilate on above fifty mile if say forty will be safer few of horse might get bit further than taking round reckoning have be going hard for last few day forty be longest can calkilate on afore hear red skin yell behind two brother be about forty mile from here steve rutherford said ah have heard of be two butte close together ai yes must be safe enough there if red skin in creation be attacking might starve out must never climb up one of brother there ai no climbing up at stand straight up round other have got track up have seen cattle on top do know way up steve yes be with party came out from canadian looking up cattle have strayed did find many of cattle injun have got may be sure stopped at foot of butte did hunting for day two three four of climbed up ai road must choose to drive team down must not have thought that cattle must have climbed if have be told did so still be good enough for there be attempt to gallop at full speed horse being kept at canter pace to be most accustomed there steve said pointing to lower country ahead of for have since starting be gradually descending there be brother look far away hugh who be riding beside remarked guess be near fifteen mile lightning must have said five if have be asked hugh said wish be only five expect before get half way to will hear injun behind yes broncho have be telling what think of well there be one thing if get to butte first can keep whole tribe at bay yes lad a far a fighting go there be one thing agin water hugh asked have hit say a there may be water up there reckon there be for told cattle must stay up there for time without coming down there be no cattle when be there did see water may be at time there be top of place seemed to lowest in centre not great deal perhaps maybe not more than three four foot if there be hole in middle there may be water there wur thinking of at time did look for maybe in rain get filled up there be enough to last cattle time everything depends on have be thinking hugh said that if be to ride straight on might get through to next ranche horse be first rate one be sure must do distance if have started after couple of day rest must carry hundred mile doubt there ai nothing out of way in have ridden a much score of time see lad have not have much rest not much time to eat since started rode out from camp then on to first halting place made ninety mile next day made sixty reckon then be going yesterday till halted before went up through pas kept on going till good bit past midnight may not have done more than fifty sixty mile got feeding till got into dip about two o'clock morning if only have horse after that indian rode down to gainsford must say horse must carry a well a theirs must wo be so bet life that mob saw outside village be fresh one fust thing must do when got to camp in afternoon must be to send of lad off to grazing ground with horse have ridden to fetch in fresh lot besides that a told there will be others of tribe coming up jining in chase score of will be on fresh mount will be just on best pony have got for will guess that be heading for canadian lad will never do must ride down sartin thing be whoever go have got to know foot of country to travel at night to be able to find way to nearest ranche job will be mine reckon know more of injun way than anyone here if anyone can do job can besides be place have gone into affair to get rosie out of hand of red skin be duty to get out of scrape listen whole party checked horse simultaneously a air brought to ear long quavering yell looking back saw against distant sky line confused body of horseman two mile good ai broncho about must say steve have got twelve to ride now then let pony know have got to do work shout of rider tightening of rein touch of spur told horse what be required of sped along at very different pace to at have hitherto travelled be right think long tom said to hugh have be riding good deal faster than have think will gain on now not anything to speak of will be at butte long before catch though see when one party be chasing have got great advantage how do mean tom see what advantage have have advantage lightning horse ai same can go lot faster than others can keep on ever so much longer than others there be good bad of course there be tom be same with party sartin be lad see party be chasing go at speed of fastest horse waal not of fastest speed that most of can keep up who be badly mounted drop in rear be left behind others consarn about now be just contrairy with party be chased have got to go at pace of slowest horse among ca leave one two of mate to marcy of red skin have got to keep together to fight together if must be to die together there be lot of difference among horse in crowd just took what must git when started thar wur picking choosing thar wur one apiece for good bad pace be going ai nothing to horse of yours will soon see that of others ca keep up then will have to slow down to pace did think of tom yes see party pursues have immense advantage over one fly providing of course be greatly superior in number if not there will be time when best mounted men must no longer ride at full speed because if did must be inferior in number to chased when came up to be reasonable lad if red skin behind be only lot from village will bring up bit know well enough ca lick if ai pretty nigh three to one so will want whole crowd up wo be able to travel at speed of best horse be why said that will beat easy ai really be band from other village that have got to fear know kintry know where other village be must be surprised moment to see band cutting in from right left of injun must ride straight off there will have heard news a soon sooner than band went after to rock will guess line must take will be on fresh horse be what be thinking of time suppose steve know hugh said know ai said much dropt behind hour ago said to 'keep sharp look out on side tom be where danger come in ' for next five mile pursuer did not appear to gain ca take easy steve jim gattling asked of horse be beginning to blow bit there ai more than seven mile now between butte might let walk for five minute now to get wind again steve turned in saddle looked round at horse wiry little animal a be many of be showing sign of distress will go little bit easier said just little when get to brow mile ahead will get better view then will see about horse be pulled in little still kept at gallop until got to top of ascent from point there be smooth regular fall right down to valley from rose butte six mile away now have got to ride for mistake steve said sharply there come way be just what be afeard of exclamation of something like dismay broke from many of men for two band of indian be seen one on hand riding like for butte one to left be perhaps mile away considerably in advance of on right be perhaps twice a far be like just beginning to descend long incline will pas crowd to right broncho harry said others will cut off sure be so harry steve said quietly there be one thing there ai above forty fifty of while crowd to right be twice a strong if have be first must have be over with well travel too fast lad ca pas ahead of lot to left there be fear of crowd to right just go at pace be going now look here what have got to be done be have got to keep together with woman in middle of have got to go right through now nine of have got rifle keep next to gal moment have got through injun ride with straight on to foot of butte must go with because know just where path start one else doe moment get there jump off pony take post among rock open fire on injun broncho with rest of directly be through turn again charge just check for about minute will be enough then ride in will cover with rifle be about harry replied now boy hear with rifle go straight on look here empty six shooter into a charge more wipe out better then rest of with just give yell to scare then close with again empty six shooter at first keep fire till be through be mighty hard if others with six shot apiece clear way for must bear in mind that will want shot after be through so throw away one bother about advance crowd with woman will keep eye on when see be ready will give yell then will ride for together indian saw that have in power to cut off white from butte no longer rode at headlong speed at be going when first perceived slackened down pace must if have chosen have brought on fight at distance from butte have motive for doing so saw large party coming from other side preferred to delay contest till last moment in order that friend must be near at hand steve remarked with satisfaction that did not attempt to outride party fool said to broncho harry wo be there above hundred yard before wo get above one shot before be on if have known business must have ridden fit to kill horse till got there then jumped off run up path held must have lost number at least fighting way up in fact with woman with must have done scarce word be spoken a party galloped on mile after mile have be passed butte be now towering up in front of when within mile of foot rider gradually fell in to place assigned to with rifle went in front then woman then men with revolver only small party of indian kept on until within hundred fifty yard of foot of butte then halted turned white be at moment two hundred yard behind great party of indian on right be about mile away indian in front did not await shock of white knowing that impetus of latter must give advantage raising war cry dashed forward to meet discharging rifle a came not shot be fired by white until two line be within twenty pace of other then revolver of ten men in front cracked out sharply several of indian fell then there be crash a line met then for moment confused medley indian fighting with tomahawk spear white with deadly revolver condition be too unequal there be not one among band of white who must not rely with certainty upon aim a in close line boot touching boot pressed on indian melted like snow before seemed to hugh moment from time fight began till path before to butte be open forward shouted steve be through boy a hugh dashed on heard broncho harry shout cracking of revolver yell of indian woman be riding abreast with now never mind gal steve shouted tumble off together be few second before first band threw from horse took up post behind boulder bush a dismounted steve gave loud shout almost at same moment party have fought under leadership of broncho harry wheeled round rode towards have there be only indian have tried to bar way to reckon with there must have be need for to seek refuge at butte number have fallen under bullet of front line of white a fell upon charge of broncho harry detachment have completed effect of blow whole conflict have only lasted minute in time deadly six shooter have wrought terrible havoc with band of indian le than half of went galloping back to meet advancing friend several of be leaning over saddle evidently badly wounded over twenty lay together at spot where two party have met few of horse stood quietly beside dead owner rest be careering wildly over plain loud cheer broke from party of white a broncho harry band rode in dismounted have be pretty tight race long tom said beat handsome tom do stow away horse a snug a can among rock tree then take place down here will get bit higher up so a to get wider range for rifle have time for now must just give other crowd hint that have got rifle can use now boy take steady aim at clump of red skin throw away shot there be nothing like straight shooting for skeering red here go steve taking steady aim fired while companion followed example illustration chapter xiv surrounded by red skin large band of indian have checked horse five hundred yard from foot of butte a saw survivor of party in front galloping back to realized that white have gained shelter of more impetuous spirit have however ridden on be distance in advance when rifle of defender cracked out four of indian fell from horse three others be wounded with companion wheeled round rejoined main body who now at order of chief fell back be few minute later reinforced by band have followed on footstep of fugitive now boy can go up to top first let see how stand have gone down yes there be two missing long tom said saw two of first line go down a charged john spencer wur killed jim gattling said wur riding next to boston wur other broncho harry said wur riding in line with behind saw go back ker plumb knew wur hit through head by way fell four other men be be now found wounded one of woman have be hit in shoulder with rifle red skin ai account with rifle on horseback long tom said let lie down get piece on log can shoot pretty straight be just throwing away lead to try to shoot with rifle from horse never knew more than two three white who be anyway sartin with piece when horse be on move six shooter worth ten rifle on horseback fellow kin gallop keep arm straight when come to holding out long tube with arm pony going on jump stand to reason there ai no keeping thing straight if red skin have hurried up dismounted steadied rifle on saddle reckon might have wiped out half of before reached waal steve woman best part of others may a well get up to top broncho two three of boy will stop down here look after horse lightning may a well stop down here with kipple of other fellow with rifle so a just to give hint to keep at distance otherwise will be sending lead up while others be getting to top indian showed sign of intention of harassing for present knew that rifle in hand of defender carried farther straighter than own have suffered heavy loss already be in way disposed to do anything rash knew that there be occasion for haste fear of fugitive attempting to make escape after consultation drew further off into plain in short time smoke must be seen ascending at several point there ai occasion to wait down here no longer long tom said injun know well enough that ca take place not at least without losing hundred men ai red skin fashion to throw away life special when know have only got to wait to do job without fighting at so let go up path be comparatively easy for three quarter of way to summit of butte seemed that on side rock have crumbled away in past age so a to make gradual slope else water wind have thrown up bank against height of butte above broad valley must be about three hundred foot slope be covered with tree undergrowth until terminated abruptly at face of wall of rock fifty foot from summit at one point only wall be broken by sort of gap cleft three foot wide at bottom slanting a steeply a roof of house bottom be worn almost smooth by rain of century by foot of cattle hugh have to sling gun behind use hand to grasp irregularity of rock on side to get up on reaching top found that summit be almost flat couple of hundred yard in length a many foot in width be covered with grass several tree of considerable size be scattered about over surface well bill said a royce came up to have found water yes there be rock pool in centre there by big tree there be water enough for horse for maybe week enough for without horse for month more what be going to do bring horse up here have settled that yet reckon will bring best of up anyhow suppose there be possible place indian can get up except by gap nary one everywhere else rock go straight down to plain there ai way except by flying to get up here if come by gap anyhow will bring horse good long way up slope be long line along bottom there red skin might crawl up in night must pretty nigh have to keep guard steve say that though where came up ground wur enough ai so over rest of slope that what with boulder undergrowth thorn be pretty nigh impossible to get up through tree anywhere else expects that be be water washing down earth sand through gap have filled up between boulder made smooth going where came up so will bring up horse get best of up here tie others just below gap can take down water in hat if decide to keep get up to morrow if like anyhow will want will be to keep four men at watch down below must have thought best to bring up at once bill what be use of leaving below waal hugh there ai grass enough to bring up here morning can take down let graze below there air fear of injun coming close to drive off if tried critturs must come up path again of own accord except took from indian can get good lot of sweet grass under tree down thar a long a get that can do pretty well without water thar do see thar be two three more lot of indian coming down to join others will have three hundred of down thar before long make much difference how many of there be if dare not attack hugh said that be where be wrong hugh broncho harry who have now joined said more thar be of closer watch can keep to see that none of get away more thar be of bigger party must be that come to rescue may be sure that have scout for mile mile off if get news that there be party coming up will just leave guard to keep here go down fall on did think of harry yes will need very strong party to bring off perhaps will get tired go bet on hugh ef thar air one thing injun never get tired of be waiting time ai nothing to chap can send out party to hunt just a if wur in own village boy will bring down corn gather firewood for a long a be up here will stop down thar if be six month know how many of thar be here lot of must have be up here at one time knowing time of year how much rain have fallen lately there ai doubt can calkilate pretty well how much water there be in pool will know that will keep horse a long a can will reckon three week at outside will see end of water a for food of course be right have got horse to eat horse be pretty nigh a good a cow beef must just a soon have one a other young broncho sight tenderer than old cow day hugh now took turn round edge of butte be a royce have said mass of rock rising perpendicularly from plain be separated from other butte by gap hundred fifty foot wide be clear that have once formed one mass for between be rocky shoulder connecting be very steep on side narrowing almost to razor edge at top where joined butte on be standing edge be fifty foot below top rose a retreated from on opposite side reached up to level with plateau fire have already be lighted on top of butte over woman be cooking of meat have brought from indian village in short time whole party except two who be placed on sentry to watch movement of indian gathered round waal boy steve said when meal be finished reckon thar ai time to lose have best start to night there ai no denying that air in pretty tight fix here wo be easy to get force a can fight way through crowd reckon will not be able to gather over fifty cow boy on canadian so will have to ride to nearest fort get troop to help air about two hundred mile from canadian ull take three day to get there after leave ranch ull take four at very least before troop will get down there ca reckon le than week will be two day getting down to ranch a there wo be travelling by day so see if start to night ca reckon on seeing back afore ten day at earliest will be about steve see a can do without troop noway waal can hold out fortnight easy must put horse on mighty short allowance of water so a to make last fortnight if find running out quicker'n expect must kill off animal matter about bit ef come up strong enough to thrash red skin without help yes think have better go to night be a likely to get out to night a night will have to look mighty sharp steve for may bet life injun will be a thick a bee round butte how do mean to go steve hugh asked tie rope together lightning get lowered down over edge have be looking at ridge run from butte to other hugh said struck that if be lowered down on to might get along on to other butte of course two others must be lowered with then must be let down from farthest side of other butte said nobody have ever be on anyhow indian be not likely to be a thick over there a must be round one thunder be right again lightning will go have look at at once will soon be getting dark broncho do long tom go along with will lie down afore get to edge may be sure that there be plenty of sharp eye watching round if be to see standing there looking at ledge of rock might guess what have in mind while be away rest of might go down get up pony took time to lead horse up slope prince four others be brought up to plateau be necessary to tie strip of blanket under foot to enable to get sufficient footing to climb up through gap must have thought that cattle must have come where horse ca hugh said cattle can climb pretty nigh anywhere cow boy addressed replied have seen cattle climb place where must have thought that nothing goat must get to see hoof be softer than horse get better hold on rock horse must get up here easy enough if be shod have fair show with shoe on by time horse have be brought up night have fallen four men be told off a guard two of took up post way down slope two went down to foot attack be anticipated for indian must be sure that sharp watch must be kept there must be chance whatever of making way up to summit unobserved hugh be not with first party on watch joined crowd round fire what time be going to start steve a soon a get quite dark thar ai no good in waiting air on watch now will be on watch night so thar be difference way sooner go farther will git afore morning be settled that if be caught to night jim gattling will try next ef go down too broncho harry will try after can settle among yourselves will volunteer to be next hugh said couple of day prince will be ready to do anything if be to try must start on back take chance indian can not have many horse a fast a be if can get through safely may ride a hard a like there wo be many who can catch anyhow if came up one at time have revolver can hold own must like to try to night for many of horse be fresh prince want at least twenty four hour before be fit for work again if like to give up attempt to night steve will try to morrow night lad will do a have planned might do might not more likely must not for like enough must run agin dozen of going out must get lasso dropped over shoulder afore saw heard besides be young lad have got life afore be getting on rosie will have jim to look after so make much matter along of hour later be perfectly dark steve have left hat lying on edge of rock exactly above ridge when have visited with harry long tom several of rope be knotted together while be being done steve withdrew with daughter jim gattling from fire be absent five six minute came back by be ready said good bye to hope a will see agin afore long shook hand with round then taking up rifle walked away without looking round followed by broncho harry long tom latter saying to hugh two others come too will want to lower last of down to hoist up again hat be soon found three men took off boot broncho harry tied of steve together by short piece of rope slung over shoulder tom left revolver belt behind now be ready harry said mind steve a go down keep face to rock so that gun of yours sha' strike ca be too keerful know loop be placed round steve shoulder under arm lie down hugh with face over edge then steve can tell if be one side other of ledge looked plumb down from here may be harry have rather to hugh surprise taken up blanket a left fire now saw object be partly folded laid over edge so a to prevent chance of rope touching rock being cut by now tom will hold out bit beyond face harry said two do lowering away now steve steve knelt down at edge lowered until strain came on rope broncho tom held out a far a must other two steadily lowered be so dark that hugh must not see ridge presently lost sight of steve soon however heard voice about foot more to right few second later strain on rope ceased be right steve hugh asked yes be astride of be wider than thought be now will move on can let broncho down a soon a like other two men be lowered then there be long silence be easy matter hugh knew to crawl along ridge for be by mean even great danger be that there might be loose piece must be dislodged go clattering down below when however ten minute have passed without sound being heard watcher felt sure that three men must have gained opposite summit there be nothing now to do to sit down wait at end of hour half hugh who be again leaning over listening intently heard voice below lower down other rope hugh be here short rope be lowered for long one have be taken by to lower steve from other butte in short time broncho long tom stood beside think old man have got safe off broncho harry said have stood over there listening time ai heard sound there be plenty of varmint about hear that barking of prairie dog hooting of owl be letting other know where be be thick everywhere guess round foot of butte did hear on other side reckon there ai many of there anyhow steve must have got beyond by time wur first rate idea of yours hugh never must have got through if have lowered off here be no joke getting along ridge in dark can tell air accustomed to balance in saddle so made shift to get across in place rock wur pretty nigh a sharp a knife do think that there be chance of night attack broncho one never can answer for varmint reckon a be like to try know must get up to top must hope for must be to kill of horse cut off men on watch must be worth risking many life to do besides ai nice place to climb in dark can crawl along out on plain without making more noise than snake must do be different thing to climbing up among bush rock in dark must reckon on doing without being heard hugh may be that one two of young buck wanting to distinguish thirsting for scalp may crawl up see if can catch one napping down below there reckon be ai likely to be tried to night be out there trying to make sure that one get away be first consarn besides like enough chief will try in morning to get to surrender must do for young brave to make venture on own account until be sartin that ai going to get without fighting

listen for sound over there to right in case of red skin must try to crawl up through bush to circumvent will go to left broncho kin take middle of path hugh took up post maintained vigilant watch be much more afraid of attempt on part of indian to crawl up on right than of attack in front listened intently for slightest sound of moving leaf on side for knew that indian must not be likely to break smallest twig in progress in front of must discern expanse of plain stretching out there be few low bush here there at time to straining eye seemed that of dark mass moved knew that might be only fancy hour after hour passed presently harry stole up to side day will be breaking in hour hugh keep sharp look out now will try if try at just a sky begin to lighten however remained quiet hugh felt in slight degree relieved a light stole gradually up eastern sky felt that harry anticipation be incorrect that attack must be made a soon a sun rose sentry be relieved party on watch retired to crest

relieved must be surprised if try attack before morning in first place have be wonderful quiet day in next place reckon when chief said acknowledged that must hold place just meant to give idee that

a well be out of way if there be fight ten men soon got horse up on to plateau then lay down to sleep morning be just breaking when crack of rifle be heard be followed instantly by score of others outburst of fierce yelling man sprang to foot ran to top of path hugh do two others take place on edge of rock on right of gap tom stumpy rason take place on left kiver a fall back if have to a be like enough come on with rest of standing on edge of cliff hugh saw flash bursting out rapidly among rock tree at foot of slope soon perceived that be mounting upwards crowd of indian must have thrown

edge in minute whole party be gathered on crest daylight be now broadening rapidly not one of assailant must be seen though puff of smoke from behind rock bush showed how thickly be gathered will try rush do think hugh asked broncho who have taken post beside think so harry said expect did reckon on finding so many men on guard on slope thought might carry with rush get here afore be ready for before wur light enough for to shoot straight ca gather thick enough among rock down thar to give chance of making big rush apparently be also opinion of indian who soon learned that be dangerous to show position by firing for shot be answered instantly several be killed a raised head to fire from behind rock firing therefore gradually ceased now be just a be before harry said wur sartin must hold slope if made attack only thing be be nearer for rush in dark than be afore there ai fear of trying a long a be light six will be enough to keep guard at present will talk over what be best to be done six men be picked out a guard rest assembled in council have got to block up gap somehow harry said if make rush in dark may kill lot of chance be will get up seems to that have best kill horse pile up down near mouth will make breast work will stop bullet there be general chorus of assent then hugh said that seems very good idea harry must think that must be better if be to make breast work

never even try see a be up to something by firing suppose can make out what be like enough one of will crawl up after get dark to see when report what have done will know that game be up a far a taking place by storm be concarned from time forward attempt be made to renew attack indian still held slope for shot be occasionally fired whenever one of defender came near enough to edge to allow

united lower down to form north fork of colorado river from point until reached pecos distance of over hundred mile there be water at ordinary time caravan must not have followed route must have kept far to north must have be exposed to attack by comanche ute so in spite of strength thought prudent to follow longer safer route with view to journey across desert waggon carried empty hogshead slung

time hugh royce have succeeded almost daily in bringing couple of stag into camp game be scarce in parched arid region where not only water be wanting grass be scanty in extreme only sustenance for

guard at gate so be one of side have to try have learned from what men said that most of gang be away scattered over country down to el paso so a to bring news at once if there be search for girl going on chief lieutenant be down in village must ride in with messenger who brought down ramon answer there be guard inside house because men at fire said be time for two of to go relieve guessed

from mouth of valley must have be mighty difficult to break into house with nine men inside a many out besides must never do to run risk even if have done have found girl with throat cut must have have to fight way up valley to horse bullet might have hit one of be case where have right to risk anything be for don to decide what be to be done now know about can lay before lightning have better saddle up ride with must go because know will believe what tell must go because will want to guide force back here so a to avoid chance of being seen on way horse have done eighty mile since time yesterday so be use thinking of starting to night besides there be hurry will be off in morning after breakfast sim be about to saddle doctor horse when royce said doctor have better take horse be

to go back same way came hugh asked doctor a rode off there be occasion for will ride thirty mile so along foot of hill east then strike straight by road for el paso be about nine o'clock now will be there by five o'clock wo go in together will wait on road come in by other way after dark what must be better put up at jose have better not go up to don until to morrow morning be to go up directly returned scoundrel who be watching don might suspect that journey have have connection with business next morning hugh arrived at don ramon having obtained horse at hotel why where have be senor hugh don carlos exclaimed a servant showed into room where be at breakfast when rode with father into town to give alcalde notice went to hotel found that be out sent over there three time yesterday day before knew nothing of have taken horse gone out evening returned have left no word when must come back have be quite anxious about feared that harm have befallen also be quite sure that must not have left without telling of intention indeed hugh said must have be ungrateful indeed for kindness if have left in such terrible trouble before tell have be doing please let know what have happened here about mid day day after daughter have be stolen don ramon said horseman rode up saw coming guessed be man be expecting be shown in here carlos received handed letter here be will translate beenor don ramon perales if wish to see daughter alive will a speedily a possible collect dollar in gold hand over to messenger will send for when receive money daughter will be returned to give warning that if effort be made to discover whereabouts if armed body be collected by for purpose of rescue daughter will at once be put to death signed ignatius guttiero ' what did reply don ramon wrote that must take time to collect so great sum in gold must send up to santa fe at once use effort to get together in shortest possible time demanded however what assurance must have after money be paid daughter must be returned to to have received answer must hardly get one before morning hugh said look surprised senor have found out where be hidden have found that out others cried in astonishment companion hugh said indeed beyond riding good many mile have have little to do with matter credit lie entirely with two miner spoke to of with whom be going shortly to start on expedition to placer know of then related reason why miner have suspected where gang of brigand have headquarters step by have ascertained that girl be really there then explained scheme that doctor have on ride down arranged for rescue don ramon wife son be greatly moved at narrative have indeed rendered service that can never repay don ramon said risk be terrible must fail must cost life must ensure fate of daughter be in way afraid about own life don ramon there be not likely to be more than twenty of scoundrel there if be discovered before must get to daughter must fight way off think in case seeing that there be only four of certainly must not throw away prospect of ransom by injuring captive must suppose that have undertaken on own account a sort of speculation though doubt must remove daughter at once to other place must not injure see plan be that force propose will be at hand will not advance unless hear three shot fired at regular interval will be signal that have succeeded in entering daughter apartment that be safe with in case will push forward at once to assist if on other hand hear outbreak of firing will know that have be discovered before reached daughter will retreat with force silently return to el paso by same route by went out must then of course continue negotiation for ransom at rate don carlos said claim right of accompanying be sister who be in peril will not permit stranger to risk life for when remain safe at distance must agree to senor agree to at once hugh said thought that be probable that must insist upon going with be clearly right to do so must not be attempted don ramon said gravely if in way can recover daughter by paying ransom risk must be terrible although two hundred thousand dollar be large sum must pay four time over rather than risk must be run question be what guarantee brigand will give that will return captive after have received money will know soon will decide nothing until receive answer must not be well senor for to go over to arrange with officer in command of fort for twenty thirty men to start with at moment notice if decide to make attempt to rescue daughter sooner set about better be if intend to take troop instead of party of own men have already seen commandant don ramon said be personal friend rode over here directly heard news offered to place whole of force at disposal must think fit to use at moment servant entered said that man wished to see don ramon mexican left room returned in minute with letter be brief senor if want daughter back again must trust give guarantee beyond solemn pledge will tell messenger on what day will have money ready delay more than week will come again to fetch see that be not followed for will cost daughter life if attempt be made to find out where go daughter will be returned within twenty four hour of sending out money will try plan senor don ramon said firmly must not trust word of cut throat oath even in smallest matter assuredly not in one such a what will say in reply to letter must write say that although condition be hard must accept that doubt whether can raise so large sum of gold in course of week beg to give ten day before messenger return for pledge honour that attempt will be made to follow to ascertain course take don ramon wrote letter took down to hall where messenger be waiting surrounded by servant who be regarding with friendly aspect there be answer don ramon said a handed letter to man tell leader will keep word trust to keep now senor hugh will give detail of plan how do propose that troop be to be close at hand when required without presence being suspected doctor idea be senor that must morning send letter by servant to commandant will tell that believe have clue to daughter hiding place that everything depends upon troop getting near spot without suspicion being excited will beg to maintain absolute silence a to movement of troop until to night to issue order until gate be shut communication closed will then order officer twenty men to be ready at four o'clock in morning to start under guidance of miner who will to night arrive at fort bearing card will of course be doctor request officer to place absolutely in hand plan be that will keep other side of river travel thirty mile up then halt until at point must be a far off from brigand hiding place a be here if fact that detachment have started becomes known to friend of brigand will not be suspected that there be connection between journey affair with daughter after will start again cross river meet at one o'clock near village of ajanco thence will go up into hill rest there day come down upon gulch where brigand haunt lie that sound excellent plan senor how do propose that will get away without being noticed to morrow evening doctor agreed that best plan must adopt must be to ride over see banker first thing in morning will seem perfectly natural then in evening after dark don carlos must again ride down to will naturally take at least four of men down with a guard will leave horse with when enter banker will then pas through house at once leave by back entrance wrapped in cloak will then proceed to spot mile out of town where juan who say know country will be waiting with horse also will be there people who be watching will certainly be watched will naturally suppose that be at banker at ten o'clock will come to door tell men to return home with horse to bring back at ten in morning a son will sleep there even must anything be suspected be hardly likely scoundrel must have clue whatever a to direction will have taken a at rate will have have two hour start before can begin to think that anything be wrong be capital plan senor keep on adding to already deep obligation to everything be carried out in accordance with arrangement hugh returned at once to el paso in evening doctor mounted horse rode to fort next day passed quietly a soon a became dark hugh went out to stable saddled horse without seeing of men about yard rode off in direction of don ramon then making circuit of town arrived at spot where juan be waiting with horse have be placed in thicket short distance from road so a to be unobserved by anyone

thursday next when mr randolph got out of train at kendal hugh be awaiting on platform bless be exclaimed a young fellow strode up to be big lad when left be big man now tunstall over well have be

whom want to introduce to when tell that have come way with from mexico to do service be will acknowledge friend worth having well that look a if there be really something in what have got to say to hugh men take journey a unless for strong reason what be friend for a have idea what have be doing three year know whether have be consorting with prince peasant with little of mr randolph one of friend be californian miner a good specimen of one a can meet with other be doctor rather a must say have be doctor for have ceased for year to practise have be exploring mining have come over purely for sake of doing service mr randolph asked elevating eyebrow little simply that mr randolph strange a may appear to legal mind however a be hotel where be putting up wo be kept much longer in state of curiosity sim doctor be oldest friend trustee mr randolph mr randolph be two very good friend doctor hunter mr sim howlett in state introduction be always performed ceremoniously two men shook hand gravely with lawyer said mr randolph hugh went on that be good friend may add that be also good friend of late uncle william tunstall of late uncle hugh what be thinking about why be alive well more be pity muttered to know what be saying mr randolph be dear friend of late uncle william tunstall who be foully murdered in town of sacramento in california on way to san francisco in reply to summons to return to england mr randolph looked in astonishment from one face to a if to assure that heard correctly gravity showed that be not mistaken will tunstall murdered in california repeated then who be that man who murdered who having possessed of letter paper came over here took place gambler of name of symonds friend obtained warrant from sheriff at sacramento for arrest on charge of murder for upwards of year dr hunter travelled over california mexico in search of never struck that be anything case of murder for money have on idea of step symonds really took of personating man have murdered never occurred to met in new mexico be considerable time together before learned that name be tunstall for out there men be known either by christian name by nickname then at once said have year before have mate of same name then gradually on comparing note truth came out well well well well mr randolph murmured seating helplessly in chair be wonderful have taken away breath be amazing indeed can hardly take in yet lad be sure of what be saying quite sure that be making mistake quite certain however doctor will tell story for doctor proceeded to do narrating event at cedar gulch how murder have be discovered body identified how verdict of wilful murder against person unknown have be returned by coroner jury how sim howlett have gone down to sacramento how have traced deed to gambler symonds there can be doubt mr randolph said when concluded that be a say that man be william tunstall murderer will be able to bring to justice will not hugh asked be why wanted to meet here so that must arrange to arrest before have suspicion of return ah be different thing altogether hugh evidence of two friend confirmation can doubtless be obtained from sacramento a to existence of gravestone erected to william tunstall of finding of coroner court will doubt enable to prove to satisfaction of court here that scoundrel be impostor murder case be different in first place must have to bring forward charge give evidence in united state obtain application for extradition british law have jurisdiction a to murder committed in foreign country having set united state authority in action must return here aid in obtaining order from magistrate here for extradition evidence of friend must doubtless be sufficient to induce magistrate to grant order then must be taken over to state suppose sent down to california to be tried there friend here will be best able to judge whether jury out there must convict man for murder committed eight ten year ago unless very strongest evidence be forthcoming must be next to impossible to obtain evidence of people waiter others from whom friend gleaned fact put upon trail of symonds without evidence there be legal proof must hang man morally of course there must seem to be doubt about be in mining camp together knew object for will tunstall be leaving for england that be entitled to considerable property on arriving here followed down to sacramento at rate went down at time be together drinking there uncle be found murdered man appeared here with letter that uncle carried obtained possession of estate be very strong chain of evidence be link proved might suffice to hang here at present have actual proof that symonds ever be in sacramento with be man be drinking with even must find waiter others be very unlikely that there must be one to identify after time symonds counsel must argue that there be proof against client must of course claim that symonds knew nothing about murder that afterwards obtained paper from man who really committed murder that idea of coming over to england personating tunstall then for first time occurred to so think must find extremely difficult to get verdict out in california merely on evidence of two gentleman of own that be possessed of letter wrote to tunstall in case if decide to have arrested on charge of murder will have to go back to california to set law in motion there to get state authority to apply to supreme authority of united state to make application to government for arrest extradition must do before have idea that have returned at rate before know that have idea of crime otherwise will of course fly will have mean of stopping might be in fiji before application for arrest be received here hugh companion looked helplessly at other be altogether unexpected blow have imagined have to give evidence to ensure arrest trial execution of william tunstall murderer doctor finger twitched look that sim howlett knew so well came into eye be about to spring to foot when sim touched wait doctor said will talk about afterwards then what do advise mr randolph hugh asked after long pause must say that for present must content with arresting on charge of impersonation of obtaining possession of uncle estate by fraud think proof now have in evidence of two gentleman in copy of finding of coroner jury will be quite sufficient to ensure conviction in case will get must say seven year penal servitude perhaps fourteen for although will not be charged with offence conviction that murdered uncle in order to obtain possession of estate can not be very strong in mind of judge yes must think must give fourteen year at least may of course want other evidence can be obtained from sacramento such a official copy of record of proceeding at coroner inquest must be matter for counsel to decide own opinion be that evidence of two gentleman that william tunstall who corresponded with father received letter informing of will left mining camp on way to england be murdered on way to sacramento be real william tunstall will be quite sufficient be very lucky thing for by way hugh that there be provision in father will that if william tunstall died without issue half of property came back to for clause have effectually prevented from selling estate must have done long ago have be possible to do so to knowledge have tried over over again that clause have always prevented have raised little money on life interest will of course have claim on estate now now what do say be for to decide in one case will have enormous amount of trouble may finally fail in getting american jury to find man guilty of murder in case if do find so will not execute for murder committed so long ago be probable that will get off with imprisonment for life may be acquitted altogether on other hand if have arrested at once here on charge of impersonation fraud be morally certain of getting sentence at age will be pretty nearly equivalent to imprisonment for life certainly think be best plan hugh agreed think so asked turning to others think so sim howlett said at once even doctor though le readily agreed since last illness have changed good deal have no longer fit of abstraction be brighter more cheerful than sim howlett have ever seen before loss of blood low fever have brought to death door have apparently relieved brain of load have for year oppressed let be so said reluctantly have met out in west must have be different a be perhaps be best late that evening party proceeded to carlisle early next morning mr randolph went with others to one of county magistrate after laying fact before obtained warrant for arrest of john symonds alias william tunstall must congratulate mr tunstall magistrate said to hugh after have signed warrant upon discovery scoundrel have be disgrace to name have be for year consorter with betting men blackleg stand in worst odour be said that have mortgaged life interest in estate completely ruined mr randolph nodded yes believe be pretty well at end of tether at moment might be turned out of byrneside well there be end to that magistrate said men who have proved even sharper rogue than be will be disappointed be sorry for person who have passed a aunt for know that be spoken well of by people in neighbourhood fancy have have very hard time of with of course must have be accomplice in impersonation of uncle be sorry for very sorry hugh said be always most kind to have reason to believe that did in power to protect from see at death must have inherited whole property now know that be not man to stick at anything be sure that acted in fear of have private reason for believing so too mr randolph said for unless be greatly mistaken have deposited document that in case of death must have exposed whole plot in hand of legal friend of mine however will not occupy time longer will start at once with couple of constable to execute warrant returning to carlisle mr randolph secured service of two constable hiring vehicle started at once for byrneside on arriving there mr randolph said to servant announce to mr tunstall say that be not alone following closely went across hall a opened door announced mr randolph others entered man be standing on hearth rug woman looked flushed excited be evidently in midst of quarrel symonds looked up in angry surprise when party entered do duty mr randolph said to one of constable john symonds arrest under warrant on charge of impersonation fraud deep mexican oath burst from lip of man then stood quiet again who dare bring charge against asked do hugh said stepping forward be witness men who knew at cedar gulch who identified body of murdered uncle traitress symonds exclaimed in mexican in instant arm be stretched out there be report of pistol sent out exclaimed turning to hugh a be in act of again raising arm there be report of pistol fell shot through brain others stood stupefied at sudden catastrophe doctor said quietly saw hand go behind knew be up to mischief ought not to have waited be always mistake to wait in case hugh sprang forward towards woman who have be kind to have fallen back in chair gambler bullet have done work have struck on temple death have be instantaneous excitement in county when news spread of what have taken place at byrneside be great indeed revelation made before coroner jury greatly added to returned verdict lola symonds have be wilfully murdered by john symonds that latter have come by death at hand of frank hunter who have justifiably shot at killed while opposing by armed mean officer of law that blame attache to said frank hunter when be over hugh be warmly congratulated by gentleman who have come in to be present at inquest upon recovery of whole of father estate upon escape from danger have certainly run at hand of murderer of uncle be much affected by death of woman still thought of a aunt document that deposited at lawyer in london showed how completely have acted under fear of husband that have knowingly risked life to save doctor sim howlett remained for fortnight with at byrneside have urged upon to make home for while to settle near at end of time doctor said to one evening sim have talked matter over hugh have made up mind have heard from that be owner of dollar must not have taken have known at time must not like to hurt don
