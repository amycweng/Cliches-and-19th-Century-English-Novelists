numerous warlike population by mere handful of spaniard be one of romance of history indeed writer of fiction must scarcely have dared to invent so improbable story even bravery of spaniard advantage of superior arm must not have sufficed to give victory have not be that mexico be ripe for disruption aztec instead of conciliating by wise gentle government people have conquered treated with such despotic harshness that be ready to ally with invader to join with heartily against central power so instead of battling against empire single handed spaniard have really only to war with great city be assisted by vast army of auxiliary fortunately detail of extraordinary expedition of cortez be fully related by contemporary writer several of whom be eyewitness of scene described be not necessary for however to revert to a prescott in admirable work on conquest of mexico have given summary of have drawn most vivid picture of event of campaign book far surpasses in interest volume of fiction must strongly recommend reader to take first opportunity occurs of perusing whole story of have only be able to touch upon principal event while history be silent a to voyage of swan be recorded by spaniard that english ship did in appear off port of san domingo be fired at by chased from island be not until twenty thirty year later that english buccaneer openly sailed to challenge supremacy of spaniard among western island to dispute pretension to exclude other flag own from water may however be well believed that ship spoken of be not only english craft entered spanish main that adventurous trader of west country more than once dispatched ship to carry on illicit trade there such enterprise must necessarily be conducted with great secrecy until relation between spain england changed religious difference broke up alliance existed between during early day of henry th g henty chapter startling proposal on march rd trading vessel swan dropped anchor at plymouth must in day be considered tiny craft indeed be then looked upon a large vessel one of owner master diggory beggs have good reason to be proud be only of eighty ton burden there be few ship sailed out from plymouth of much larger size plymouth be even then rising into importance a seaport having flourished mightily since downfall of once successful rival fowey large ship be not needed in day for only cargo sent across sea be costly precious good occupied small space cloth of fleming silk satin of italy produce of east passed first through hand of venetian genoese merchant wine of france spain be chief article of commerce thus freight for vessel of eighty ton be heavy venture none merchant of wealth position must think of employing larger ship in respect spaniard italian republic be far ahead of commerce of england be small thing indeed in comparison with of flanders in plymouth however swan be regarded a goodly ship master diggory beggs be heartily congratulated by acquaintance when news came that swan be sailing up sound having safely returned from voyage to genoa a soon a anchor be dropped sail be furled captain reuben hawkshaw cousin of master beggs took place in boat accompanied by son roger lad of sixteen be rowed by two sailor to landing place be delayed for few minute there by number of reuben acquaintance who thronged round to shake by hand a soon a have freed of strode up narrow street from quay to house of master diggory reuben hawkshaw be tall powerfully built man weatherbeaten tanned from many coming going upon sea with voice must be heard in loudest storm fierce look a men knew gentle kind at heart though very daring having a seemed fear of danger from man tempest roger be large boned loosely jointed be likely day to fill out into a big man a father who stood over six foot two without shoe reuben be wont to complain that be too big for shipboard if crew be men wholly of size must say ship must be able to carry scant crew for lie a close a must there must not be room for full complement below for indeed in day space be precious on board ship men be packed well nigh a close a must lie having small thought of comfort being well content if there be room to turn without angering lying next on side merchant who be so stout portly that offered strong contrast to cousin rose from desk a latter entered be glad indeed to see back cousin reuben trust that have fared well with indifferent well cousin diggory have good stock of italian good on board a of course took up small portion of hold put into cadiz on way back there filled up with three score

doubtless guessed be laden beat off stoutly with loss of only six men killed among have bad weather coming up portugal coast have two men washed overboard have stabbed in drunken brawl in street besides there be of course many who be wounded in fight with moor in drunken fray ashore be doing well loss of little blood will not harm so voyage may be termed easy pleasant one be well merchant said in tone of satisfaction can not expect voyage like to pas without accident how be roger asked turning to boy who be standing near door with cap in hand until must please elder to address be well thank master diggory be seldom that anything ail with trust that mistress mercy cousin be well have best go upstairs see for roger father have weighty matter to talk over must fain be alone roger be glad to escape from merchant counting house bowing to cousin went off with quiet step after have closed door behind be changed into rapid bound a ascended stair gently roger mistress beggs said a entered room where two daughter be sitting at work be truly glad to see must remember that stay at home people be not accustomed to boisterous way of sea reproof be administered in kindly tone roger colored to hair for indeed in delight at being back again have forgotten manner be expected from lad of age on shore however knew that although mistress beggs be somewhat precise in way be thoroughly kind always treated a if be nephew of own rather than young cousin of husband therefore recovered at once from momentary confusion stepped forward to receive salute mistress beggs always gave on return from voyage dorothy agnes remember cousin roger two girl who have remained seated at work have however made little progress since father have run in two hour before to say that swan be signaled in sound now rose made formal courtesy then held up cheek to be kissed according to custom of day there be little smile of amusement on face must have told close observer have mother not be present greeting must have be warmer le ceremonious one well well roger mistress beggs went on be marvelous to see how fast grow why be scarce six month since sailed away seem head taller than be when went so swan have returned safely without damage peril damage to speak of cousin mercy save for few shot hole in hull good many patch on side work of moorish corsair with whom have sharp brush by way be there loss of life roger have come back nine hand shorter than sailed with there be few on board still unfit for hard work did fight cousin roger dorothy beggs asked did what must with bow until got alongside then joined in melee a well a must heathen fought bravely be not match for men being wanting in weight strength little able to stand up against crushing blow of ax be nimble quick with curved sword fierceness of face shouting must have put men out of countenance who have le reason to be confident than ours trading have gone well asked mistress beggs who be known to have keen eye to main chance believe that father well satisfied cousin mercy that venture have turned out fully a well a looked for be well roger do girl go on with work can sew while be listening will go see that preparation for dinner be going on regularly for maid be apt to give way to talk gossip when know that swan be in a soon a have left room two girl threw down work running across to roger saluted most heartily be much better welcome roger said than formal greeting before gave wonder what cousin mercy must have said have chanced to come in again mother guessed well enough what must be when be alone together dorothy said laughing always think right on special occasion to keep to manner to make sure that know how be becoming to behave know well roger that be not strict with generally like to enjoy when be staying up at farm with aunt peggy let run about a will never interferes with save when spirit carry away altogether think must be glad if always lived in country now roger let hear much more about voyage fight with moor be black men not at dorothy be not very much darker than own fisherman when be bronzed by sun wind there be black men who live somewhere near country there be several of fighting with black be bigger men than moor have thick lip wide mouth believe that live a slave among moor who be with fought a bravely a did needed man with stout heart to engage with so ugly be face be not terrified roger be frightened at first dorothy felt strange weakness in knee a began to swarm up ship side passed off when scuffle began see there be time to think about have to do best even have be frightened ever so badly hope must not have showed for must have brought shame upon father a well a in truth thought little about one way other there be on deck have to be driven back again set about work like englishman honest men thanks to pike ax have not very much trouble about especially when once became fairly angered on seeing of friend undone by heathen must rather go through two three such fight than encounter such storm a have off coast of portugal for four day seemed that must be lost wave be of such exceeding bigness far surpassing anything have ever seen before heart be in mouth score of time over over again thought that must never rise again so great be weight of water poured over truly be mercy of god alone saved for believe that even father thought ship must be beaten to piece though kept up show of confidence in order to inspirit men however at end of fourth day gale abated be day before great sea went down wave coming in long regular hill seemed to a big a have here in devonshire smooth regular so that while rolled mightily there be naught to fear from must not like to be sailor agnes said must be far better roger be to come into father counting house know must take into business did cousin reuben desire roger laughed must make poor penman agnes love sea dearly be seldom that have such gale to meet a after be worse to be drowned than be to come to other death be well content cousin with matter a be must not stay ashore spend life in writing not to be a rich a greatest merchant in plymouth almost wish sometimes have be born spaniard portugal for then might have chance of sailing to wondrous new country instead of voyaging only in european water seems to that have plenty to see a be roger dorothy said say nay to roger assented see why spain portugal must claim indie east west keep others from going there pope have given indie to dorothy said see that be pope to give roger replied that might do for king minister wolsey bishop when in time people have read a do master wycliffe bible will come to see that there be warrant for authority pope claim then may perhaps take share of new discovery hush roger must not speak so loud about bible know that though there be many who read be not thing to be spoken of openly that must bring into sore trouble be anyone to hear speak so freely a have done there have be burning of lollards say that wolsey be determined to root out follower of wycliffe will take trouble to do roger said shrugging shoulder still will be careful dorothy for must not on account bring trouble upon here thank heaven england be not spain where men be forever being tortured burned for religion english must never put up with that may be that there will be persecution methinks be rather whose opinion lead to make speech be regarded a seditious who stir up people into discontent who fall into trouble that a long a folk hold own opinion in peace quiet trouble not others neither king cardinal will seek to interfere with be not so in spain there upon slightest suspicion that man woman hold view differing from of priest be dragged away thrown into prison of inquisition tortured burned mistress mercy now returned girl busied in laying table for dinner that evening after mistress mercy girl roger have retired to bed reuben hawkshaw cousin have long talk together concerning next voyage of swan after master diggory have discussed chance of voyage to low country trip to mediterranean reuben who have be silently listening to said well cousin diggory to tell truth have be turning over project seems to to offer chance of greater profit though deem not without risk be case of course with trading affair a know greater risk greater profit so question to be considered be whether profit be in fair proportion to risk run think that be in case be ready to risk life in carrying out be for to consider whether be ready to risk venture what be reuben there be other voyage that know of unless indeed think of sailing up to constantinople trading with grand turk thought go farther afield still diggory be matter have thought over for time when be at cadiz other day made many inquiry have confirmed in opinion on matter know that spaniard be gaining huge wealth from indie heard at cadiz after conquest made year since of island call cuba store of precious thing brought home be vast indeed a know bring from there gold spice precious wood article of native workmanship of kind know reuben also that like dog in manger suffer none others to sail sea that english ship have ever yet traversed water be so diggory by hear number of island be large there be report that there lie farther west great land from be procure chiefly gold silver precious thing now seems to be matter secretly conducted so that news must be sent to spain ship might slip out cruise there dealing with native return richly stored with treasure swan be fast sailer did fall in with spanish ship must show clean pair of heel of course must avoid place where spaniard have fort garrison touch only at at hear trade little took out scroll from bosom unrolled showed to be map purchased for ten gold piece of spanish captain who have come to poverty disgrace from ship being cast away while be asleep in liquor in cabin fault be rare among spaniard therefore thought more of met in cadiz at wine shop near port told story a drank together for spoke dutch having traded much with low country took out map to show of place at have have adventure said that thing be curious must buy of if be disposed to sell said that must be a much a life be worth to part with to englishman indeed that be only captain of ship trading in sea who be allowed to have seeing that matter connected with island be held a state secret after trouble chaffering however agreed to make exact copy to sell for ten gold piece be copy be exact for compared with original before paid for now here see be laid down position bearing of island together with port place where spaniard have settlement line over here represents mainland be a see vaguely drawn seeing that except at one two point spaniard have little knowledge of now seems that with help of might so navigate swan a to avoid much risk of falling in with don might yet make shift to fill up ship with good of kind such a must sell here for great price know of course be taken must be killed without mercy in first place must have to catch must not be easy in second to capture methinks must be more difficult still seeing that crew of stout devonshire lad fighting with halter round neck must give good account of even if overhauled by great spanish galleon what think of scheme cousin diggory be perilous one certainly reuben merchant replied after long silence there be risk of loss of ship freight there be risk of loss of life of of crew must rather lose even swan reuben than harm must come to roger then may well be that even if carried scheme to successful end returned laden with wealth king counselor when matter came to ear must be sure to do on return for must make prodigious talk might be grievously offended accuse of embroiling england with spain confiscate cargo visit with fine imprisonment treat crew a pirate fear that reuben said relation with spain have grown cold lately there be talk of peace between france in next place must say that king must be mightily glad to see chance of english having finger in pie that spaniard want to keep to that will perceive that great advantage will arise from obtaining share of trade with indie there be rare jealousy in country at spaniard portugal keeping trade of indie in hand methinks even if judged necessary to make show of displeasure against men who led way in matter there must in end be much honor a well a profit in venture be grave matter reuben one not to be undertaken without much thought calculation still own that proposal be tempting one that possession of map will examine at leisure must help much in enterprise truly a say although king might frown there must be much honor a well a profit in being first english merchant to dispatch ship to spanish main love not spaniard like englishman who think a do on matter of religion have viewed with much disfavor alliance with men who be such cruel persecutor of who be not of religion hate reuben hawkshaw said energetically swagger a if be lord of world hold others a of account beside if resolve on enterprise will of course do utmost to avoid must try to lay hand on will be right glad to show that englishman hold fully match for well well must not think of diggory beggs said hastily nevertheless cousin if swan sail for sea will see that be well provided with ordnance small arm so that will be able to hold own with who must meddle with be ask diggory sha meddle with if meddle with if treat a pirate to be slain without form of trial must not blame if act a pirate when come upon hold that be beyond law when be once beyond sight of land going westward have only to take at word a to piracy if thing be whispered a to cruelty to native be true pirate be innocent kindly folk compared to openly proclaim that found in sea claim a own will be treated a enemy slain without mercy will be therefore fully justified in treating a enemy spanish ship that may come across holding a fair prize if be strong enough to take must not go out with intent reuben if fit out swan to go to indie be that may trade honestly with such native a be ready to trade with not that may wage war against spaniard quite understand that cousin diggory reuben hawkshaw said with grim smile that also be intent if spaniard will let adhere to only if be attacked must defend if try to capture beat be natural that must capture against have nothing to say reuben can find authority in scripture for spaniard claiming portion of sea a right world be a seems to open to trade pope anyone else have right to parcel out for exclusive use of one two nation a know sea within mile two of shore be held to belong naturally to who own land be different thing altogether to holding that more than sea inasmuch a know of be to be held a private property by spaniard portugal well will say no more about at present there be plenty of time to think over while swan be unloading certainly like to take so great risk a must be on own shoulder if must get two three others to join must be willing enough to embark upon need not tell diggory that behooves to be right careful a to to whom may broach remember that incautious word might ruin enterprise altogether if so much a whisper of reached ear of spanish ambassador in london must apply to king to put stop to king harry might think of must hardly permit swan to sail in face of such remonstrance for to do so must assuredly embroil with spain will be careful reuben for see a well a do will only speak to men who have before now worked with in joint adventure on whose discretion can surely rely will talk matter over with reuben first if appear favorably disposed will meet here show map explain intention fully to if three others join in equal share will propose that a be idea a have obtained map will have equal share with of in business will in addition to pay a master take one fifth of profit after payment of expense will content right well cousin diggory from moment will can tell regard a rich man unloading of swan occupied time there be undue haste in day bale be hoisted by whip from hold then carried up to master beggs ' warehouse sailor have earned fair time for repose after hardship of voyage took matter easily be more than week before swan hold be empty during time merchant have not made allusion to reuben a to conversation on evening after swan came into port reuben be surprised anxious at silence knew that cousin although enterprising be cautious man have hardly hoped to find proposal so favorably entertained have looked for absolute refusal at first expected that must only arrive at end after long dispute discussion therefore doubted not that diggory be turning matter over over in mind settling detail perhaps broaching matter to merchant have spoken of swan once empty be laid up on shore where dried at low tide so that must have seam caulked coat of pitch laid on below waterline be made tight sound for voyage on might be dispatched reuben hawkshaw have lost wife year before when in port at plymouth always occupied lodging in house short distance from of cousin spending evening mostly at master diggory refusing to take breakfast dinner there know what be what cousin must say when merchant pressed roger to come to breakfast dinner woman be woman a be only right hold to nicety of thing nothing displeases more than for people to come in late for meal when be at work work if when clock strike hour for meal be in middle of job see that be finished before men knock off then there be matter of washing cleaning up for one gather much dust dirt in hold of ship so do what must roger must never reckon upon being punctual matter must weigh on mind when ought to be thinking of other thing diggory will be free men taking bite sup on board a can make shift to get then when work be over coming with clean hand clear mind to supper with when swan hold be empty will be time enough to talk about amusement evening after unlading of cargo be completed master diggory said to wife get table cleared a soon a can mercy bring two flask of last batch of spanish wine out of cellar put cup on board have two three friend coming in to talk over matter of business with reuben a soon a table be cleared roger asked permission of aunt to take cousin for walk upon hoe be readily granted a there be other room in must well be bestowed having set wine upon table dame mercy retired to look after domestic matter of always found abundance to occupy in short time master turnbull master streatham master winslow three worshipful trader of plymouth arrived cousin reuben master diggory said have spoken to good friend of mine in respect of venture proposed to must fain hear more of from own lip can speak with confidence before for whether agree to cast in lot with not word of matter will pas lip reuben addressed to task at much greater detail than have given when first speaking of matter to diggory told what have gathered from sea captain others a to article with don traded with native that be for most part cheap common that amount required for sufficient stock of such merchandise must be very small small hand mirror string of colored glass bead brass ring trinket colored handkerchief bright cloth be article chiefly used in barter knife ax be greatly prized native considering iron to be more valuable than silver gold small bell brass vessel be also valued iron spear arrow head be eagerly sought for spaniard be chary of providing such good seeing that might be used in conflict against then produced list of store must be required for ship crew in matter said will think perhaps that demand be excessive be of opinion that money in way must be well spent a rule though say before men accustomed to victualing ship crew be vilely provided for salt meat must eat for other can be obtained at sea must be of good quality likewise other provision want not biscuit be alive with maggot moldy flour pea other thing cattle must turn up nose at want everything to be very best of kind with cider good sound in fair abundance be not ordinary voyage will be away for many month maybe for year two unless men be well fed will assuredly lose health likely enough become mutinous if come upon spanish ship when three part of crew be weak with scurvy will make poor fight of therefore want to keep men in good strength in good heart to do must be well fed voyage a english ship have ever made before cooped up a will be in swan for must carry great crew everything depends upon there being fair ground for grumbling many ship have be lost from crew being weakened by scurvy if be to bring enterprise to good end say that there must be stint in matter of provision that must be very best of kind trust once out there will be able to obtain abundance of fruit vegetable from native for be thing above necessary to keep men blood sweet on shipboard then a to arm think must carry twelve piece six of side of four must be of good size yet not too large to be quickly handled in matter of weight spaniard be sure to have advantage of if can shoot much more quickly than can will equalize matter then of course there will be bow arrow hold greatly to new musketoons man can shoot six arrow while can fire one of that with straighter truer aim though be true can carry somewhat farther then of course there will be pike boarding ax good stock of powder ball for cannon be complete list have made out now hold that must carry from eighty to hundred men must pay only ordinary rate of wage must have interest in venture according to rank a to profit must leave to master to reckon seeing that in fair trade one can get gold to say nothing of silver weight for weight for iron other thing in proportion can judge for yourselves what will amount to to say nothing of chance of falling in with spanish treasure ship may be rash enough regarding easy prize to fall foul of there be doubt that profit will be great if return safely home master hawkshaw nicholas turnbull said chance of seem small think that chance be good enough to risk life upon master turnbull reuben replied man can show greater confidence than be map of cousin diggory have doubt spoken to see that island be many of great that place at spaniard have port be few in comparison have to avoid anywhere else can open trade with native if be chased find place too hot for can make away to mainland cruising along there may come upon place that spaniard have never visited may there gather great store of gold silver without danger wish one certainly not cousin diggory to enter upon affair unless with confidence good heart must far rather take horse travel to bristol lay scheme before of trader there idea be most distasteful to trader for plymouth regarded bristol with great jealousy diggory beggs at once said reuben friend master turnbull did not mean that regarded scheme a hopeless only that risk be doubtless great know that to earn great profit one must run such risk venture divided between four of must not be very heavy one be to say not beyond what be justified in periling must leave for while reuben will examine list that have made reckon up total cost will then see better how much will have to contribute to make up venture reuben nodded putting on hat left room saying in hour will return then strolled over to tavern much frequented by master of ship in port chapter bound to unknown part when reuben hawkshaw returned to chamber where diggory beggs be in conference with other three trader found that have finished calculation matter be settled reuben a far a be concerned three friend will go equal share in matter value of swan be to be taken a part of contribution if ever come back again a hope may do sum will be deducted from share of profit due allowance being made for what damage injury may have suffered be understood will take share of profit equal to ours one third share will in first place be set aside to be divided among other officer crew will be left entirely to to choose officer men need not tell sort of fellow to pick out for such business will see that swan be provided with new rigging gear that there be plentiful store of thing on board to repair damage may suffer from storm foe good friend here be willing that purchasing of store required will be in hand will yourself test quality of provision before bargain be concluded so a to see that everything be sweet wholesome friend here will not appear in affair at for if folk saw that four of be concerned in venture must think that be something quite out of ordinary preparation will be made a quietly a possible will be given out that swan be going to make voyage to levant that will carry stronger battery of gun than usual to beat off moorish pirate may meet by way a be known that have sharp fight coming homeward will seem only natural that must add to armament will write up to agent in london to purchase for article required to trade with native bid send round here by sea well packed in bale if be to purchase so many strange article here must give rise to talk for people must wonder with whom intended to trade such good tomorrow morning will make out list of what deem advisable for purpose for hour party sat talked for now that other trader have fully determined to go into venture be quite excited over truly if must be spared from business here must gladly go with myself master streatham said have always have longing to see strange clime a englishman have yet set eye on country be about to visit friend reuben must gladly be by side take share in peril adventure doubt not heart courage master jonas reuben replied must warrant that must behave doughtily in case of fight with spaniard indian question whether must support hardship of voyage a cheerfully a must danger although may store swan with best provision that money can buy diet of naught biscuit salt meat pall after week to say nothing of month of more in hot climate where appetite weakens one come to pine for dainty cake such a devonshire wife be famous for yes fear never must support that master streatham who be large corpulent man mightily fond of pleasure of table agreed with sigh besides friend jonas diggory beggs put in mistress tabitha must have voice in matter however much spirit must lead to such adventure doubt whether must let put foot on board be not for to be running after adventure nicholas turnbull said in first place be sober citizen have wife family to think about business affair of town in next place even must leave master reuben hawkshaw must not thank for company foot of space be of value on ship men who take up space consume food can neither set sail work cannon be useless encumbrance have spoken truly master nicholas reuben said bluntly in matter of trip to london even a far a low country must accommodate worshipful honor well enough on journey like man who can not if need be drink bilge water eat shoe leather be best at home took voyage once be many year ago now to amsterdam owner not good cousin here took fancy to go with wife must need accompany verily before voyage be over wished be dead be no longer captain of ship owner be captain wife be be forever putting into port for fresh bread meat milk egg for must eat none other if wind got up ever so little have to run into shelter anchor until sea be manner of sailor shocked must scream at night when rat ran across must lose appetite if living creature of a usual ship be full fell from beam onto platter be tempted more than once to run ship on to rock make end of day sail out from plymouth in freshly launched ship on fine day with store of good victual few flask of good wine be right merry business farther than wish not to see passenger on board ship command others laughed well master diggory must be going nicholas turnbull said be getting late tomorrow will come over in forenoon a suggest will go through list more carefully talk over price see what bulk will occupy discus many other matter with aid advice of master hawkshaw there be occasion for undue haste yet if thing be to be done sooner be done better a party went out reuben found son waiting outside door well father asked anxiously when three merchant have walked briskly off towards home be settled roger a soon a everything be prepared swan will sail for spanish main roger threw cap high in air with lusty shout startled better passer by hurrying towards home for be now long after dark although town watch patrolled street regularly prudent citizen did not care to be abroad after nightfall silly boy reuben said have lost cap nay heard fall somewhere here roger said searching besides cap be small matter one way other ah here be floating in pool of mud however bucket of water will set right in morning o father feel wild with joy only to think that have talked over together be going to be true that be to be first englishman who ever saw beautiful island talk about native with feather strange attire spaniard with loaded gun dungeon gibbet reuben hawkshaw put in not for father bottom of sea maybe not spanish dungeon hope not lad still man can see future however be right glad that be to try adventure be glorious one will bring honor in eye of englishman if succeed to say nothing of wealth mind that let not spirit run away with tongue word of must be spoken to soul must mention be made of in hearing of cousin mercy girl four partner in adventure have taken solemn promise to other that will not breathe word of even to wife averring that woman must never be trusted to keep secret though a far a have seen of methinks woman can keep bridle on tongue just a well a man indeed somewhat better since loosen with cider wine strong water believe be not so much that doubted whether wife must keep secret a whether must approve of enterprise that made contract together in order that might afterwards be able to assure wife that for part must gladly have taken into confidence that be obliged to fall in with wish of partner be strange thing roger methinks whereas most men behave valiantly enough when come to blow with enemy great proportion be coward with wife why must be father be easy question to ask roger difficult one to answer maybe will understand matter better day when have taken wife to yourself in matter there be doubt that woman wit outrun of men that have wonderful sharpness of tongue now man when thing go wrong with speaks out loudly roundly storm rage when be over there be end of now woman be not like that seems to ponder matter over in heart to bring out a be piecemeal throwing little dart at when expect saying little thing to from suddenness can find reply pricking furiously over until be ready to roar out with pain vexation see roger prick hurteth more than great cut must not have thought that father be because have not thought matter over roger in fight with moor many of men be sorely cut wounded heard cry from only set teeth harder smote more furiously upon foe there be one of have sat down suddenly on small nail must have roared out like bull have sworn lustily for good half hour so be in domestic matter man rage storm when thing go wrong wife if be woman of judgment hold peace until be over knowing well enough that will be at mercy afterwards then set to work like gnat came on board at genoa that call mosquito startle with shrill buzzings in ear pricketh in tenderest spot can find drawing smallest speck of blood causing itching make ready to tear flesh mother roger be one of best of woman be good housewife affectionate know that ever saw greatly ruffled in temper there be time when must fly from house not come up from work on board until be time to go straight away to bed so did prick sting with tongue that not shrilly with anger with little thing let a be unawares with air of ignorance that in way applied to no roger if will take advice will make ship mistress will have way will learn will know just how much helm requires how sail must be trimmed with woman man attains to knowledge if take advice will give wide berth know went on in answer to roger merry laugh that be matter in man will trust to other experience than own man who take woman to wife think that can manage go into matter with light heart a if be mere pleasure excursion on be embarking whereas in truth be voyage a full of danger peril a upon be about to adventure now let turn back to lodging for have nearly gone on face four time already in deep rut hole must that councilors of town must see street of genoa cadiz amsterdam might then try to mend way of plymouth make somewhat le perilous to passenger after dark work began in earnest upon following day number of shipwright be set upon hull of swan be to be thoroughly overhauled caulked pitched within without mast rigging be to be carefully looked to defect repaired new suit of sail be ordered old one to be patched where moorish shot have torn so a to be of use a second suit did misadventure happen to others james standing first mate took charge of matter reuben hawkshaw assisting diggory beggs in thing relating to store greatly be provision merchant of town surprised at quality of provision master beggs ordered for use of swan nothing fine flour of last year grinding freshly killed beef pork to be carefully salted down in barrel newly baked biscuit must satisfy reuben hawkshaw must scarce believe that such article must be meant for use on shipboard for a rule very cheapest worst quality of everything be considered a amply good enough for use of sailor then too cider beer must be thin sour sweet of good body surely master beggs must have gone off head thus to furnish ship for never before have vessel sailed out of plymouth harbor provided after fashion ample store of rope cordage of matter required for ship equipage be also laid in to question a to surprising lavishness of cost diggory replied must have ship well found in matter be other day that antelope returned from voyage to levant have lost third of crew from scurvy of rest six be strong enough to pull at rope when came into port did not woman follow master skimpole owner through street cry after that be murderer of husband by reason of foul victual that have provided for use will cost more to start with will be cheaper in end for weak crew often mean losing of ship besides loss of good name have never carried economy to such length a did master skimpole be resolved in future that who sail in ship will have good wholesome fare then if misfortune happens one will be able to point to in street say that fed men worse than dog thought only of profit nothing of life of who served indeed master diggory after short time quite forgot that provision for health comfort of crew be outcome of reuben hawkshaw insistence came to regard with feeling of pride a man possessed of greater benevolence than fellow merchant week after refitting of swan be completed be afloat with large

have taken into council woman be not so discreet matter be very important must be kept secret might have leaked out have not be proposed that concerned in matter must bind solemnly to other to say

hand arrived have be quietly told that voyage be likely to be one of unusual length that none save willing ready to stay away a long a might be required be to sail in swan on present venture there be therefore general idea current among that master hawkshaw have adventure quite out of ordinary in mind news that heavy gun have arrived from london for have confirmed opinion a to voyage let have loud talk tonight reuben hawkshaw ordered when get sail spread tomorrow be well out of port can talk to heart content night be still want not that attention of on shore must be called to ship there have be more foolish talk than enough about already so turn in to rest lad without ado boatswain will serve out pottle of cider such a never drank on board ship before warrant be sample of what will have voyage when have tossed that off let lie down a can find space will divide into watch settle a to man place tomorrow pengarvan set four hand aside to go on shore with boat hour before daybreak tell off to sleep where can lay hand upon easily keep boat alongside make off to wharf a noiselessly a can will be on deck then will give further order second mate only replied ay ay captain hawkshaw for be man of few word reuben hawkshaw be not fond of cornishman made exception in case of pengarvan indeed although border joined there be little liking among cornish devon men for other be black ill conditioned dog reuben hawkshaw must say good sailor own none better glum surly in way with nothing joyous in nature seems to that working in darkness in hole of theirs underground have infected spirit of whole county a might well do seeing that a everyone know there be little people who guard treasure of mine who if can not do bodily hurt to who delve for metal can yet infect spirit with black melancholy do other grievous harm so when pengarvan came to a boy on quay here asked to take with to sea did not much like doing so for saw at once by speech that be cornish did not like to turn away for said that be willing accustomed to sea so gave trial have turned out first rate sailor be chary of speech not given to jest laughter be always quick willing to obey order taking come in good part bearing just same in storm a in sunshine know naught of history swan have be home since first came on board twelve year ago a long a be afloat never leaf when be laid down for repair take nearest lodging on hand abides there till be afloat again believe that come from fowey guess that got into trouble other have to run for be nothing to want better man know come can rely upon pengarvan to stand by ship to last if men be astonished at thirty new hand who came on board on previous evening be still more astonished when a many more embarked in morning newcomer be ordered to keep in forecastle in quarter under until swan be well away from land there will be good many eye turned on ship a soon a be seen to be shaking out canvas reuben said there be need to set tongue wagging by showing more men on deck than usually carry captain diggory beggs talked late on into night went over ground again reuben brought out map of island showed where intended to touch think not to do much trading there said there be gold in hispaniola cuba captain got chart from said there be very great store there that native have little of when spaniard first arrived seeing that took trouble labor to obtain be by nature altogether averse to hard work moreover place little value on gold there be rumor among that farther west there be land where gold be in great plenty where there be powerful people dressed in gay attire wearing great bracelet necklace of gold so far spaniard have not found land though have sailed down coast long way to south northward a far a point master cabot reached when sailed down from newfoundland due west have never sailed far have found sea ever stretching away in front of so that be clear that great mainland be split in two at point there be vast bay will try to discover if find people of whom indian speak may well return loaded down with gold advice to cousin diggory be that partner must continue to keep silent a to voyage of ours if come not back after time there be talk here that have gone to indie news may be carried to london may be questioned may be blamed mightily for undertaking adventure without king permission sort of harm may fall upon success must in mind altogether excuse will be able to offer so great present to king that will be mighty contented if fail will be otherwise therefore advice be till swan be anchored in port say nothing about be best from moment sail to write off have be spent upon a money lost just same a if knew for certain that have gone down a soon a be out of sight of land folk will ask have become of will truly say that have have news when month pas on come not will shake head say that begin to fear that evil have befallen may have gone down in storm be cast on rocky coast perished be captured by pirate if friend of sailor make stir go to magistrate have to show copy of letter of instruction drew up other day laying down be to make for african strait to put into portuguese spanish port by way be then to shape course for island of malta to take in fresh store of food water there then be to pas round southernmost point of greece sail upwards to constantinople there to dispose of such portion of cargo a must sell at good profit buying good suited for market with monies received if hold be full be then to return straight to england if have still of cargo unsold must trade a best seemed to among eastern island with port of asia there must be instruction to show a be notorious to that provisioned ship in best manner possible laid in greater store than ordinary of thing necessary for voyage none can hold to blame in way if chance of sea have proved too masterful for swan return more must carry out enterprise to fullest gain great store of gold will if be possible come not directly home to port maybe in ireland maybe in low country whence can send word to upon hearing of coming there must advise fellow adventurer to journey straight to london to gain audience with one of minister tell have matter of great importance to communicate to king that must then lay before majesty account of what have done pray to pardon boldness be due to desire for honor of country a much a to wish for profit beg to accept such share of gold a may think fit will of course when write let know about what weight of metal have on board in way when ship come into port will be smooth sailing for whereas if come unannounced there be saying what share of profit majesty may think fit to take think plan be very good one indeed reuben will follow to letter when think may begin to expect to hear news of be difficult to say seeing that know neither distance may have to sail difficulty may have to meet with wind current of region must say fifteen month at earliest if double that time pass without hearing aught then must say may give up hope of ever seeing again be disposed even now reuben to regret that ever embarked in venture not a surely know from fear of losing money have put into from risk will be run by lad roger who be very dear to come must not blame in matter diggory have only yielded to solicitation if go to death be choosing none of thine must swan come back without reuben a may possibly be for if there be danger be sure to expose in front of roger will be a son to will either in time have ship to command share in a thou hast will come in business when have have enough of adventure at sea be willing to settle down on land reuben wrung cousin hand silently then said let take one more glass of strong water diggory then get few hour sleep before morning be past midnight now must be up by four for at hour boat must go off for first batch of new hand day broke just a last batch of men be brought on board a soon a have gone below whistle be sounded old crew came up on deck preparation for making sail commenced anchor be hove short lashing of sail be loosened flag run up to mast head last cask bale lowered into hold hatch put on deck washed down before preparation be complete little group be seen standing at end of wharf there be good wife diggory girl have kept word to be up betimes to see last of at last be ready diggory shook hand with reuben turned to roger when captain said lad can go in charge of boat take ashore diggory just say word of parting to there in five minute roger stood on wharf can not wait cousin mercy said for be ready for hoisting anchor father said might just come ashore for one more goodbye may god protect roger mistress mercy said a folded in motherly embrace will pray for daily nightly until return goodbye roger imperil life needlessly be prudent careful for sake dorothy whispered a kissed yes for sake roger said softly agnes hung round neck cry loudly mother have to unclasp child finger god bless said roger hoarsely then ran down step leaped into stern of boat when gained deck of swan boat be hoisted in men began to heave round windlass a soon a anchor be up sail be sheeted home swan yielding to light breeze off land began to make way through water roger from poop waved cap in reply to signal of farewell from shore then running down into waist busied with work of ship until be too far away from land for figure there to be longer visible rest of crew now came on deck be mustered in watch reuben hawkshaw standing on edge of poop then said few word to men said dare say there be wonderment among in finding yourselves so strong crew at seeing swan so well provided with gun with other necessary will learn in good time about at present be best for many reason that must know nothing about matter may be overhauled by king ship may meet with foul weather have to put back into port loose tongue might do grievous damage be enough for to know that where ship be going be going that be stored with provision of such quality a be never put on board trader before everything will be done for comfort a to myself be content to know have crew of eighty five stout devonshire lad under that can give account of ourselves may meet who have sailed with before know do best for men that there will be harsh word violence on board ship save be well merited discipline order obedience will have strictly above will have grumbling grumbling crew be useless crew sick crew while cheerful crew can meet with confidence befalls think not have grumbler on board since man have be carefully chosen merry heart go way a saying have want crew to be happy one so far a order of ship permit will have indulgence at first will find yourselves pressed for space will soon eat drink room for yourselves store to be first used be down in fore hold reckon that in three week month will be cleared there will then be room for to lie in shelter when be in harbor present accommodation be sufficient for watch below providing sleep quietly have good conscience now to work while get everything tidy in good shipshape cook will get to work at copper can promise good breakfast washed down by sound cider such a have last night men gave cheer be soon at work under direction of officer mattered little to where be going what be before have guessed that be ordinary voyage be going to undertake thought wherever be be to be well kept well cared for satisfied mightily if fighting be to come into way so much better with such crew must well take part against enemy be likely to meet in poop of swan there be small saloon extending across stern two cabin on side of passage leading to be occupied by captain two mate roger took meal together in saloon in cabin underneath three petty officer twenty of sailor lived together main body of crew occupying raised forecastle cabin underneath galley be forward built up against forecastle thus sheltered from heavy sea might sweep waist of vessel four small cannon be mounted on poop two on forecastle six larger gun be in waist three on side breeze freshened a swan drew out from under shelter of land by midday shore have faded from sight crew have by time settled down in place sat in group on deck overhauling content of sea bag looking over clothes setting to with needle thread to make such repair a be needed of new hand be leaning over side wishing heartily that be on shore again who have made voyage be talking to companion about various port at might touch sight must behold save suffering from effect of sea be in high good temper a much fresh beef a be like to keep good till eaten have be brought on board wind set in next morning freshly from northeast with sail set swan ran gaily before must that wind must blow without break for month reuben hawkshaw said a sat at dinner with two mate roger standing pengarvan looked up quickly latter without question again betook to feeding standing however laid down jackknife in astonishment month captain hawkshaw must have thought four five day of must give ample westing that after westerly breeze somewhat from north must suit best ay ay must think so standing then see know not to within good many point where journey tendeth wait till have finished dinner for man can not talk eat together with comfort then when boy have removed trencher will tell over extra mug of cider what be about meal lasted for time longer for reuben hawkshaw be good trencherman one not given to hurrying unless there be need of other men be far behind chief in matter of stowage of victual at last meal be done trencher be carried off earthenware mug be again filled with cider then reuben hawkshaw sitting at one end of table with roger facing mate one on hand threw back in settle used in right of captaincy while others contented with stool began have not thought comrade to broach matter until be down in latitude of african strait seeing that wind have taken in charge see reason for longer keeping silent who have sailed with for year must have known right well that be ordinary voyage number of men have taken on board care have have a to store great number of water cask must have told that have asked question did not expect that must why must james standing growled mattered naught to where went a knew must hear in good time pengarvan said nothing nodded to show that agreed with first mate well men intent be see not why spaniard must have good thing to purpose to go trading with native down in new island of exclamation of surprise broke from james standing pengarvan only nodded again be not reuben went on so far spaniard have not gained much store of gold from island have learned that among native there be talk of rich nation lying somewhere farther to west where gold rich of sort abound so far spaniard have not found having hand pretty well full have sailed down land to south a know master cabot sailed from north down almost to latitude of island due west man have sailed yet if have have never returned to tell of well captain reuben james standing said a said before make difference to where go if spaniard catch there will cut throat to surety if can if be ready to take chance of have nothing against feel a if be taken aback bit just now a come new to own fancy being that intended to trade with turkish port island have taken strong crew on board to beat off pirate that might meet pengarvan be a expected captain thought that did not bring spaniard on board at cadiz sit plying with wine talking to by hour for nothing so when saw what be being done on board swan came to that intended to try venture in spanish main here be map got from spaniard reuben said laying out upon table here see great island be marked in place with port spanish settlement there be besides spaniard said number of small one not marked on chart in large island cuba hispaniola spaniard have made master of people reduced to slavery there must be touching at with safety profit small one have be only occasionally visited with may do trade here be line of mainland to south of island see run along a far a easternmost of then turn away to south while from north mainland come down well nigh to cuba one reason spaniard said why have not sailed west to find out land of gold be that there be great current run in between island southern land sweep out again with great force between bahamas northern land that fear being swept away by getting driven into whirlpool moreover say that there be great storm to be encountered in water to west now fact that there be current into current out of western sea seems to show that there be exit to west that water come in at south find in great bay so be forced to pas out to north how great bay may be know not surely can not be too great to search at rate be clear to that somewhere to west two great land that see to north south join now that men who have with much toil risk made discovery of new land must claim for king seems to fair right not that must claim sole traffic with land of whose very existence know nothing therefore although be true that pope have given western island to spain see not how can give to land not a yet discovered if there be a native in island say land lying somewhere to west where gold be abundant see reason why if be first there must not gather great store bale box be brought round from london contain great quantity of thing be a spaniard told most prized by native glass bead of sort kind vessel of brass iron hatchet arrowhead hawk bell mirror trinket venture be perilous one if succeed man on board will have share in profit reuben then explained arrangement have made with owner for division of such treasure a might bring home be fair proposal first mate said doubt not that on board will gladly fall in with if succeed will set tongue in england wagging there will be plenty of others warrant who will be ready to follow example have intended reuben went on to sail a far a strait then to head for island of madeira when within sight of to head away west sou west if carry wind with will make straight for island thereby will escape risk of being seen by vessel coming going a follow track south of madeira can make good fight with spaniard fall foul of be a likely to take a be to capture must fain keep clear of if can since go to trade not to fight now think have best give hint of matter in hand to old crew of whom can depend upon a indeed hope can upon though a yet mettle have not be tried take aside singly open matter to in few day will tell rest matter will go more fairly easily if have proportion of ready to throw up cap shout aye aye captain reuben one bellwether will carry whole flock after fear not that will want to hold back be just adventure will suit brave man spirit plenty to see plenty to do chance of fight chance of fortune must like to know what one must want better than besides be in high feather at quality of food say like of be never known on shipboard before that go long way be fasting man who kick full one be content however matter go pengarvan have not again opened lip nodded occasionally be captain expected of fact that have guessed destination of ship added to esteem reuben hawkshaw have for second mate three day later reuben hawkshaw called crew together informed of destination possessed rough eloquence best suited for class be addressing carried hearer with spoke a if idea that of must shrink from undertaking such adventure have not entered mind assumed that be most fortunate of men in having chance offered to yet know said how great piece of good fortune have befallen by being chosen to sail with on voyage have news be a much a whispered in plymouth must have gathered thousand volunteer in hour know how careful have be preparation for voyage how strongly be manned how well be armed what store of excellent provision what cask of good cider ale be in hold now be going to tell what be for be going lad to get gold if succeed a doubt not will man on return will in addition to wage have share in spoil share a will hope make comfortable for life loud cheer broke from men a pressed forward eagerly to listen have learned lad said from spaniard who have be out there of land abounding with gold lying to west of spanish island a yet none of have ventured thither mean that will be first to reap harvest why must spaniard keep good thing to be a good sailor a be better a good men better therefore say will have share of prize will touch on way at of island for wood water fruit vegetable there be plenty of where can find without meeting with spaniard if do meet with one try to interfere with so much worse for then when have taken in what want will sail west if find land a doubt not will will return home with such treasure a be never brought before into english port must make up mind lad that be not to be plain sailing that may have hardship trial to meet with true sailor shrink from be grand adventure lad adventure noble prince must be glad to share in there be honor glory in a well a booty will be first englishman who ever sailed sea dared to dispute right of spaniard to keep treasure of west in hand in time to come child child will be proud to say bey grandsire be one of who sailed in swan when captain ceased speaking there be shout of enthusiasm from hearer not one of whom considered to be one of most fortunate of men in being chosen a one of crew of swan be adventure indeed be mere trading voyage grand expedition there be new land to be seen there be satisfaction of outwitting spaniard there be glory honor gold to be obtained a for hardship danger recked little of always formed part of lot with so well found ship so good crew felt confident of being able to face anything might befall speedily broke up into excited group eagerly discussing news have heard new hand plied older one with question a to general strength of spanish ship number of men carried armament gun be examined with fresh attention admiration men looked along sight a if already in fancy engaging in encounter with don horn of strong ale be served out to by captain order to celebrate occasion men drank success to enterprise shaking other by hand vowing to do share bravely wind continued favorable until have passed madeira be seen like cloud on port side three day later breeze dropped there be stark calm in swan lay motionless on sea for well nigh fortnight captain knowing well that idleness be of thing most harmful to crew set to work to get up case of arm polish sword pike until shone then crew be exercised with boarding pike cutlas singlestick staff captain have provided for such occasion be brought up men be matched against other with small prize being given to who showed most proficient squad be told off to great gun instructed how must best be worked by gunner so that man must do share without hurry confusion must fain have practiced at mark captain must not have a with air so still gun must be heard at long distance might even bring up spanish portuguese vessel to inquire into cause of firing for be now far below line ship of other nation be forbidden to cross be there great need for practice for to gun be appointed a captain one of old hand accustomed to work who must be trusted to send ball straight when time must come with other exercise with such sport a sailor must devise time of calm be got through well enough have now be over month at sea thanks to honest food sound cider men health in way suffered be a well hearty a upon day when set sail when wind came came with sudden fury reuben hawkshaw have heard of sudden gale ship sailing west have to encounter took precaution a soon a began to rise furling up great sail passing lifeline along side to men must cling if wave washed boisterously over clearing deck closing up hatchway opening so though for week tossed labored in gale be none worse when ceased indeed sea encountered be by mean so heavy a with have battled on voyage home from spain while gale lasted reuben hawkshaw took precaution to enable to keep reckoning heaving log half hour noting constantly change in direction of wind so that when be over must tell within fifty mile spot where gale left for in day instrument of navigation be in infancy sailor relied chiefly on compass dead reckoning to bring safe to port however long voyage might be reuben hawkshaw knew of other plan a far a went be excellent navigator be seldom many mile out in making landfall a soon a gale abated sail be again made on ship proceeded on course in three week mate be seen frequently to ascend into top news spread among crew that spanish island lay not far ahead justness of captain reckoning be soon proved for at daybreak one morning land be perceived directly ahead though still lying like patch of low cloud on horizon cheer broke from on deck a soon a mate proclaimed that to certainty be land saw watch below came pouring up cheer saluted captain a came out from cabin tribute to seamanship in thus bringing straight across ocean on path that englishman have ever before sailed with two mate at once ascended to fore top from here a morning brightened two other point of land must be seen far away on hand be evidently approaching small island be just what hoped fear be that might strike hispaniola porto rico when get nearer land will lower topsail so a not to be so easily made out from land now will go below try mark off place on chart chapter among island now let go through calculation again captain said when entered cabin how long will be captain first mate asked hour standing then will come again if want before send for first mate went out on deck again for though well skilled to handle ship in weather a brave hardy seaman a sailed out of plymouth james standing must neither read write though in rough sort of way must reckon course ship must lie make allowance for leeway current baffling wind must bring ship into port in england low country be of use in matter of kind pengarvan be good scholar reuben have taught what knew of navigation always made keep log from time when first became mate at first comparing calculation day then once week arguing over allowance have made for tide leeway sometimes finding to surprise on arriving in port that pengarvan calculation be even nearer to truth than own be great satisfaction to for felt that if aught must happen to when on voyage pengarvan must be trusted to bring swan home a safely surely a must roger have for last two year be going through same schooling a yet be very far from attaining accuracy being unwilling to make sufficient allowance for great leeway that vessel in day made with wind abeam now pengarvan reuben said in great glee bring out log book have not compared note since started for till expected to reach land there be occasion to do so a general course be clear enough now let see where put too roger let see what hand have made of went through calculation yesterday be sure that there be mistake in figure if be right be island that see ahead one called samona while see dimly away on port hand be mariguana see by map land marked must be that see on starboard hand now what do make of put more than degree to southeast captain believe that three island see be marked a caicos great caicos in center north east on hand roger what do make of according to calculation father ought to be full two hundred mile from land heading straight for northernmost of island captain laughed even pengarvan smiled fear roger must be hardly safe to leave ship in hand at present be six hundred mile away from pengarvan island seventy le from mine well pengarvan whether be right may congratulate ourselves for have made near cast indeed seeing that be eight week since left england more than six since sailed out of sight of madeira that traversed sea altogether strange to of whose current know nothing be right to day in reckoning of distance of need feel hurt if other turn out right at finding sixty mile out on voyage of such length a headed for point because a said must steer clear of great island be a know wholly in possession of spaniard who have dispossessed inhabitant use a slave for working plantation mine a see by chart have post in island running from here northwest nearly up to mainland except small post at san salvador now will coast up through island till get within sight of columbus point at southerly end of san salvador for be island know be first discovered by in ' then will strike westward to andros after shape course due west will take north of west end of cuba well out of sight of land must be careful of navigation for a see be written here bemall island innumerable scattered among marked here being principal many of island be low show little above water sailing be very perilous not to be attempted at night ' see in course will have advantage of being well out of ordinary line of passage of spaniard who shape course more to southward make porto rico first landfall then have two great island hispaniola cuba lying straight before free a seems by chart from danger to navigation roger from evening will compare log book day by day so that may learn where be that have gone wrong can guess how be wind be blowing chiefly from east will never make allowance enough for drift have told over over again that with light wind on beam drive mile to leeward for two go on course there be many ship will drift nigh mile for mile sail in light wind when wind be brisk be going fast through water then drift little not more perhaps than one mile to six seven why be that father how be that light wind blow away sideways that strong wind instead of blowing more blow le can not tell roger must leave question for wiser head to settle only know that be so of there be doubt at why have not least idea how doe strike pengarvan cornishman shook head have thought over captain many time seems to sometimes have sort of notion why be be not clear even to myself must not put into word first mate now looked into cabin here be james pengarvan put here opposite three little island put here sixty mile away matter not at can see be standing said one island be a good a so that have got water fruit tub be getting low men be beginning to need change of diet so hope captain will lay to at first come to get what want whether be spaniard native have to fight for hope will have to fight neither standing think be likely to meet with spaniard for island in group be small one navigation dangerous a for indian fear may not find very friendly seeing that will of course take for spaniard whom have little reason to love still when see that intention be peaceable that wish only to trade may abate hostility in three hour be close to island that have first seen proved to be much nearer than have supposed at first sight be low thickly covered with tree of only few mile circumference there be chance of finding native hostile here reuben hawkshaw said number can be scanty only fear be that may hide in wood at approach refuse to have dealing with get lead ready to sound james put grease on bottom that may see what kind of holding ground be a sun have risen wind have fallen swan be now moving very slowly through water be about mile from land when log be first hove eighteen fathom captain mate reported adding when lead be hauled up sandy bottom casting lead regularly sailed on until within little more than quarter of mile of shore there dropped anchor in six fathom of water must like to be caught in gale here captain said if did come on to blow must get up anchor sail round to other side of island where must be in shelter there be native father roger who be watching shore exclaimed be waving green branch wave white flag roger fasten anything white to boat hook wave may understand that a white flag be in use by nation a sign of peace may have seen spaniard use get one of boat lowered james long boat will be best let crew take arm with lay under seat so a to land in peaceable guise myself will go ashore in see be intention of native get couple of gun loaded if see attack fire shot over head into wood will be enough to frighten however think not that will have trouble couple of box have already be got on deck by captain order string of glass bead hawk bell other article of trade taken out can come with roger captain said in few minute boat rowed towards shore eight men sat at oar eight others be bestowed in bow stern must have carried twice a many captain wished to avoid show of force group of native have increased by time boat reached shore captain saw that consisted of two men who be apparently chief thirty of inferior rank continued to wave green branch attitude be so peaceful that captain did not hesitate to leap ashore a soon a boat touched strand follow roger others keep hand on arm ready to use sit quiet show weapon unless there be occasion chief advanced with timid air towards newcomer on approaching saluted in attitude of deep humility using spanish word amigo amigo friend repeated captain in cheerful tone roger gazed with intense interest upon strange being be in color little darker than moor who have tried to capture swan on last voyage be of good height of slender figure countenance be soft almost feminine with large dark eye mild gentle expression have hair upon face that on head be long black round head be light gold band from rose plume of colored feather be naked above waist save that over one shoulder cotton cloth ornamented with fantastic pattern wrought in bright feather be lightly thrown from waist wore cotton petticoat reaching to knee have belt decorated by shell worked into intricate pattern from similar belt crossing shoulder hung quiver filled with small arrow have necklace bracelet of bright bead of european manufacture carried light spear bow hanging from shoulder follower be similarly dressed save that fillet round head instead of being gold be strip of skin decorated with shell bead mantle be of plain cotton captain took from pouch two necklace of large blue bead presented to chief also gave to of small hatchet received with token of gratitude being specially pleased with hatchet be article vastly prized by native rarely bestowed upon by spaniard who be very chary of presenting native with anything must be used a weapon captain then made sign to native to approach bestowed necklace of smaller bead upon next called to sailor bade come ashore bringing with only hanger for there be doubt that native be friendly while be doing so four of native at order of chief brought forward large basket beautifully plaited a roger judged made of tender bark of tree chief took from attendant opening placed before captain with gesture of humility be filled with fruit of be of kind such a roger father have seen before sailor now brought forward empty barrel captain signified that required water one two billet of wood be also shown captain signified by action that wished men must be allowed to cut wood to carry on board ship also pointed to basket of fruit then showed more string of bead hawk bell intimating desire to trade native readily comprehended gesture pointing to keg intimated by sign that ship must be moved round to other side of island that fruit must be taken to there men must gladly enough have wandered at once into wood to look at tree flower differed widely from anything have ever before seen captain said will have time enough for men let get off with fruit comrade on board will be thirsting for share then will get ship round on other side will have opportunity to go ashore a soon a got on board portion of fruit be set aside for use of officer rest divided among crew although be ignorant of name men enjoyed hugely pineapple guava custard apple formed major portion of content of basket cheerfully set about work of getting up anchor setting sail wind have now entirely dropped swan scarce moved through water so anxious however be men to land that gladly obeyed captain order to get out boat tow although heat be so great that at other time must have shrunk from such labor a soon a reached other side of island anchor be dropped men on board having already made everything snug captain reuben called who have be towing out of boat lad said wish to say few word before land in first place can not go must never do to leave ship without sufficient hand on board to fight seeing at moment spaniard may come round one end of island other fall upon consequently half must remain on board take turn on shore tomorrow wish to give advantage to therefore boatswain will put two piece of folded paper in hat one being blank other having cross upon if blank paper be drawn starboard watch will go ashore larboard take turn tomorrow if paper with cross come out will be other way one more matter will expect discipline on shore to be a good a have be on board ship native be to be treated well that get from will be by fair barter will be conducted for advantage of first mate boatswain will take ashore of good have brought for purpose of trade will buy not only such thing a require for ship fruit vegetable whatever native may have to sell thing will be brought on board then of who wish for of article a token from first island at touched can take making auction among yourselves sum to be deducted from wage in way will be on fair footing proceeds of sale will go into general fund to be divided at end of voyage nevertheless must advise not to purchase now to leave until have finished business be on homeward way then will see what have obtained man can buy according to liking say because if get thing now will litter up ship will get broken lost thrown overboard be far better that everything remained packed in hold until be on homeward voyage thing let man behave decently on shore be gentle kind to native who though heathen be harmless people friendly let there be quarrel dispute above let none meddle with woman warn that breach of order will be most severely punished moreover anyone who doe so offend will never have leave to go ashore again not if cruise for ten year among island second mate roger remained on board with starboard watch drawing giving advantage to others with captain first mate be soon rowing towards shore on board although disappointed that fate have decided against have share of amusement for good many canoe afterwards came off to filled with good for barter a captain before leaving have told second mate that must buy sell with who came out brisk trade be soon established have fear of treachery from native who be in such dread of white men that must not venture to lift hand against however great odds might be be therefore allowed to come on board mix freely with sailor content of canoe chiefly fruit vegetable be spread out on deck mate roger bargained with giving little looking glass string of bead in exchange for ware be mighty reasonable in demand roger said to pengarvan seems almost shame to take great basket of fruit vegetable in return for such trifle be not trifle to mate replied there be nothing unfair in exchange thing be to what gold jewel be to must give gladly score of boatload of vegetable for diamond size of pea glass bead be a valuable in eye a diamond be in ours after buying up main stock trafficked with native for little ornament wore necklace bracelet cunningly worked with bright shell seed weapon of curiously carved wood at other boat returned laden down with fruit vegetable 'we must buy more of commodity at present captain reuben said when saw what have be purchased on board have got enough to last a long a will keep eat never so heartily indeed next day number of crew be ill from quantity of fruit that consumed however soon passed off change of diet did great good scurvy disappeared in short time even who have suffered most be again fit for duty following morning roger pengarvan went ashore with starboard watch captain again accompanied for hour rambled about island wondering at strange tree foliage bright flower filled especially with admiration at tiny bird with feather like jewel flitted about among flower concerning there be much dispute among men asserting that be sort of great bee while others maintained that be bird so quickly did fly that men although tried hard failed to catch of dispute a to nature be solved by discovery that one of chief have robe fringed with skin of little creature examining saw surely enough that be bird with feather glistening in sun like jewel of many color captain reuben persuaded chief to cut off fringe sell to giving in exchange for high price of four copper ring tiny looking glass in afternoon crew set to work to re water ship by cask be filled up vessel be ready to proceed again on way next morning sail be hoisted anchor weighed native came out in great number in canoe surrounded swan a glided away from anchorage waving hand raising cry of farewell evidently greatly satisfied at treatment have received at hand of white visitor for fortnight swan cruised from island to island beyond giving crew run ashore at so building up strength getting in fighting trim must there be occasion to call upon for action little advantage be obtained from visit fruit vegetable be obtainable in abundance beyond little trinket feather there be trade to be done be clear captain reuben said a officer be gathered in cabin that there be gain advantage to be obtained from trade here native have doubtless sufficient for want be of simplest of wealth such a prize in england there be none to be have be different with spaniard make slave of poor creature force to till plantation to raise crop for to work mine who can not do thing can get nothing from longer stay in coast touched here chiefly to get water fruit to keep in health in have abundantly succeeded have best now shape course westward try to find new land rich in gold of friend spanish captain learned by report from native so far have fallen in with spaniard may do so at time although have fear of beating off might meddle with must do great harm did news spread that strange ship be in water for must assuredly send out expedition in search of from port a soon a news reached others quite agreed with captain reuben view next morning ship head be pointed west two day later when passing island saw on opening headland port with many house spanish flag flying from mast on shore two large spanish vessel be lying there be apparently on point of sailing for sail be already dropped exclamation of surprise broke from on deck of swan men ran to brace sheet in order to trim sail steady men captain reuben shouted touch not sheet tack must sail past a if bent on own business if change course now will suspect that something be wrong pengarvan do get out spanish flag from locker run up to peak be done though be easy to see by look crew cast towards strange craft that must gladly go in fight time lad captain reuben said cheerfully a saw mood doubt not will have enough fighting to satisfy before have done object here be to trade get rich if thrashing don come in way of business will do contentedly there be occasion for to put out of way to meet supposing be to go in sink two ship a doubt not be men enough to do if be to try must see from shore sooner did set sail again than boat must carry news to spanish port in quarter must have score of ship in pursuit of in time came of must interfere with hope of gain with have sailed to sea port must be newly formed one went on turning to roger for there be spanish station marked hereabout in chart course swan be taking must have carried half mile to seaward of two spanish vessel now edged point two farther out doubtless spaniard be surprised at seeing that vessel instead of entering port continued course may be that very soon discovered such point in hull rigging a set wondering what must be presently gun be fired from one of ship a signal doubtless for to heave to swan paid attention to command kept on course in two minute there be flash puff of white smoke from spaniard shot skipped across water in front of swan growl of anger broke from crew put up helm captain reuben ordered vessel be running before wind came up till head pointed straight to sea although spanish ship be still three quarter of mile away bustle be at once observable on deck men clustered at bow must be seen at work there be getting up anchor pengarvan said a watched shading eye with hand three four minute later sail be sheeted home spaniard began to move through water having set sail a soon a anchor be tripped sooner be under weigh crew at quarter than began to discharge bow gun after swan will answer captain james standing asked can bring couple of gun aft fire over rail by mean captain reuben replied at present know nothing about though may guess that be not licensed trader with due authority to trade among island suppose suspect for moment that be foreigner deem private venture from one of own port spanish trader must dare to fire on own flag a long a reply will suppose that be only trying to escape payment of heavy fine perhaps forfeiture for breach of regulation can fire away be not likely to hurt be fully mile behind will soon leave in respect captain be mistaken spaniard be fast vessel although swan kept distance on board presently saw that gained nothing shot continued to fall around spaniard worked gun slowly piece on forecastle be light one though two three shot passed through sail of swan did little damage a long a knock away spar will hold on captain reuben said if do will turn fight wind be dropping little think that if anything be gaining upon now by afternoon swan be fully two mile ahead spaniard have discontinued firing swan be heading now to pas island have for hour be visible ahead presently spaniard again began firing although shot fell in water far astern of swan be lubber up to now james standing said can not think be going to frighten into stopping now that have fairly got away from captain reuben be anxiously gazing at island ahead have laid course to pas to windward a sailed better close hauled than did spaniard who have not only fallen behind have lagged to leeward nigh mile must be firing a signal said there may either be spanish port in island may know that there be of ship lying there though can see sign either of port ship must matter little if must captain pengarvan said for ship along shore must be to leeward of must pas end of island long before must beat up there must be awkward if there happened to be port with two three of ship just beyond point must be caught between two fire then have to fight lot of captain nodded be right pengarvan must be in fix then four spaniard at once be more than bargained for be now within two mile of point towards be steering towards eye of two officer on poop be directed five minute later exclamation broke from simultaneously a sail of lofty ship made appearance over extremity of point minute later great hull came into sight helm to larboard captain reuben ordered sharply must run down island can never weather that fellow have just appeared ah there be two others coming out be in hornet nest sail be squared off swan be soon running before wind almost parallel with coast edging in little to keep farther from vessel have first chased have also changed course position to leeward now gave advantage ere long swan be almost abreast late pursuer who be about mile quarter to seaward while other three spanish ship with sail set be mile half astern good deal nearer in shore sun will be down in five minute captain reuben said in hour will be dark spaniard can run quite a fast a can bit faster think can beat close hauled wind be falling lighter lighter if be not for that must haul wind be off on other tack throw of out will be dead calm before long will be lowering boat to attack towing ship up to if be close under land might miss will be able to make out here at rate must hold on a be until wind drop altogether after sunset breeze died away rapidly by time night have fully set in sail dropped motionless swan ceased to move through water captain at once ordered boat to be lowered men swarmed into double banking oar hawser be handed into vessel head swept round in direction from have come somewhat farther seaward now lad captain said pull with will there will be good supper allowance of strong ale when come on board after rowing for hour captain ordered to cease to keep silence listening attentively must hear in still night air sound of oar whether boat be towing ship rowing independently must not tell again men set to work hope be towing said to first mate must have chance whatever of catching for strong crew can take vessel like swan through water at twice rate must row big ship ca see fellow in shore can captain be hid in shadow of land can make out others be long way farther off than when started expect will have boat after standing lot can make out can see that be gaining on ah felt breath of wind did not expect for hour two yet if breeze spring up will soon run away from stopping listening again must hear sound of oar from two direction be coming captain said beat be quicker than must be if be towing besides be great deal more distinct than be think be more than mile behind ah there be wind again there be deep flapping sound rattling of block a sail bellied out for moment then fell against mast again captain reuben went to forecastle keep up lad wo have much longer to row for wind be coming spaniard be after wo be up for quarter of hour hope will get before remember yard can keep away from be of importance put back to lad swan carried four boat strongly manned a be be gliding through water at fair rate be five minute before breath of wind came lasted three four minute greatly relieved strain from hawser be going through water now captain said can not be gaining very much upon at present confound added minute later there be end of again boat be now mile away voice of officer urging rower to exert must be plainly heard on swan officer be gazing in direction from wind be to come yard be braced sharply aft presently there be exclamation of relief a felt wind in face vessel heeled little over boat behind be quarter of mile away now while from vessel inshore be perhaps twice that distance if be true breeze be safe captain said if not will have to fight for men have already without order cast loose gun armed with pike cutlas now listen lad captain said a went forward to poop rail if fellow come up try to board let man utter word fight like bulldog a silently will beat off never fear doubt believe that be countryman who have broken trading regulation be afraid of being overhauled if there be word spoken will know that be foreigner will be chased wherever go then went to forecastle bade men in boat cast off hawser come on board be indeed no longer of use a vessel be going through water almost a fast a must row ahead of a gained deck repeated order have given that strict silence must be observed in case spaniard came alongside everything now depended on continuance of breeze on board boat saw that vessel be now holding own with order to throw ship up into wind heave to be shouted a attention be paid to several musket shot be fired at wind held faster faster swan made way through water at last boat fell behind be lost to sight be safe now reuben said exultantly be to windward of will have well out of sight before morning when day broke indeed topsail of three of spanish ship must be seen on horizon in two three hour sank out of sight swan be headed on course west chapter shipwrecked for six day swan sailed westward before gentle wind then cloud be seen rising in north spreading with great rapidity across horizon be in for tempest captain reuben said never have seen cloud rising more rapidly get sail off standing a quickly a possible crew fell to work in very few minute swan be stripped of greater part of canvas quickly a men worked storm came up more rapidly crew have half finished work when with roar turmoil that almost bewildered gale struck vessel head have be laid to south so that wind must take astern be well that be so for have struck on beam must assuredly have be capsized even have not rag of canvas be shown for wind must have caught lofty forecastle poop a be plunged heavily forward quivering a if from blow then bluff bow bore up with leap sprang forward sped along before gale have seen a sudden squall among greek island captain reuben shouted in mate ear never elsewhere hope that may prove a short a do gale in quarter hope so mate replied for know not how far land may be distant though captain knew not have be caught in one of furious gale be afterwards terror of spaniard blowing for week ten day without intermission being cause of wreck of many stout ship sea got up rapidly wind seemed to increase in fury a night fell for three day ship ran before waist be frequently deluged with water required six men at helm to keep straight before wind crew be worn out with fatigue want of sleep for running a be in unknown sea none must say what might happen when land might be sighted ahead captain never left poop mate taking place by turn with men at helm for slightest error in steering might have caused vessel to broach to in case nothing must have saved sheltered a be caboose be found impossible to keep fire alight officer men alike have to content with biscuit draught of ale vessel rolled till bulwark be under water yardarm at time dipped into sea men on deck be forced to lash to standing object to retain footing captain occasionally made way forward to forecastle where men not on duty be huddled together spoke cheeringly to saying that gale must not last much longer that a swan have weathered so far must hold on to end at commencement of storm tremendous rain have fallen when have ceased sky have cleared up for last two day sun have shone out brightly not cloud have be seen when morning broke on fourth day cry of dismay broke from wearied men on deck for ahead must be seen land stretching away on bow news brought crew from below clustered on forecastle gazing in direction of new danger must try get sail on mizzen standing captain said only chance be to bring head to wind can try captain fear that will never bring round be only chance captain repeated with loud shout called for hand to come aft mizzen be shaken out a soon a sheet be hauled aft helm be put down cry burst from crew a came round for a wind took on beam lay farther farther over great wave struck broadside sweeping bulwark away a if have be paper carrying number of crew off forecastle into sea still farther over went thought that must capsize when there be series of report like musket shot a lashing of shroud parted be followed instantly by crash a mizzen mast snapped off two foot above deck relieved of strain swan righted somewhat great wave swept over forecastle still further diminishing number of crew carried head round came up onto even keel again started on mad course before wind go forward pengarvan see how many hand have lost captain said not that make much difference for have gone short time before rest of for nothing short of miracle can save now must now be seen that coast be steep rocky that wave be breaking with tremendous force upon be about four mile distant in le than hour must be upon must try to anchor standing first mate shook head will try captain anchor will never hold in teeth of gale if did hawser must go like pack thread be afraid so standing there be nothing else to do first mate went forward pengarvan saw anchor got in readiness cable ranged along so a to run out with perfect freedom then pengarvan made way aft again to poop do mean to cut away mast captain captain nodded must sir mate went on will never hold mast mast if stand make shift to run head foremost on rock will give better chance than if drift broadside on be right pengarvan yes will be better to leave standing when within quarter of mile of shore helm be again put down a vessel came partly round anchor be let go hawser ran out rapidly topsail be only sail on be let go wind catching tearing into ribbon a be loosed there be jerk surge a anchor brought up at same moment great wave struck head cable parted again swung round towards shore be over with lad captain said to roger who be standing quietly beside god forgive have brought here to die be not fault father be for best knew when started that there be peril before goodbye lad will die a have lived brave men may god have mercy on now roger obey last order go forward climb up to end of bowsprit may be that if strike may be able to leap forward onto rock be somewhat lower just ahead than elsewhere want to be saved if one else be father roger cried passionately have always obeyed heretofore captain said quietly will do so now go forward at once do a say god bless boy clasped roger in arm in moment close embrace then pointed forward roger eye be blinded with tear a obeyed order bowsprit in day did not a now run out almost horizontally from ship bow stood up like mast leaning somewhat over bow carried yard small square sail upon roger climbed up a far a yard then aiding by halyard swarmed up until reached cap when did so vessel be little more than hundred yard from shore water be deep up to rock for wave struck on unbroken flying up in mass of spray flew far over land on lofty post thirty foot above forecastle forty five above water roger be nearly level with top of rock ahead a vessel rose on wave must see flat land extending far inland looked down two three of sailor have followed a high a yard many others be gathered on forecastle be kneeling in prayer others have thrown down despairingly on deck most be standing looking forward with set face at rocky barrier so close at hand roger looked aft men at tiller have quitted now gone forward standing pengarvan be standing one on side of captain latter took off cap waved to son mate lifted hand in token of adieu cry from below caused roger a returned salute to look round be ship length from rock moment great wave lifted vessel on crest went thundering forward rock seemed to leap up against spar to roger clung snapped off just below foot then great volume of water spray shot up from below be thrown high into air wind caught carried away inland fell with crash left senseless be long before recovered consciousness a soon a did so crawled on hand knee to edge of cliff looked down swan have disappeared not sign of remained not so much a floating timber showed on surface of water roger crawled back again for distance then threw down wept despairingly lay there for hour until heat of sun blazing almost vertically down roused then got on to foot looked round in front of stretched slightly undulating country patch of maize here there showed that be cultivated in distance saw large village with building of size proved that people have made advance towards civilization slowly painfully for be greatly bruised by fall made way to nearest maize patch ate several head of green corn then started for village when within few hundred yard of came upon three woman who be coming out with basket on head paused a approached then with cry of astonishment fear turned ran towards village cry brought number of people to door among be many men who have caught up spear bow arrow at alarm seeing one person approaching in garb altogether strange to stood in surprise a came up wonder heightened at perceiving that color be altogether different from own dropped threatening weapon stood a if paralyzed by wonder roger have not faltered in step a saw issue out death have terror for now father friend be gone be altogether reckless of what befell fearlessness of demeanor added to effect produced by appearance cap be gone ray of sun falling upon fair hair added to effect produced by white skin native taking for supernatural being bowed to ground before in attitude of adoration cry uproar minute before have sounded in village suddenly ceased be succeeded by hush of deep awe roger walked on between prostrate native seated on stone at door of hut native gradually rose to foot approached timidly made sign that wanted to drink for raging thirst have be induced by heat one of native ran into hut reappeared with bowl filled with liquid humbly presented to roger latter patted head in token of thanks then took long drink of content of bowl be totally unlike anything have before tasted being pulque slightly fermented drink obtained from juice of agave most useful of vegetable production of central america native who be distinguished by dress from rest now gave order in short time two woman approached bearing tray with flat cake of fine bread fruit of different kind more to please native than because be hungry for felt little inclination for food roger partook of of chief then harangued at considerable length when have finished roger who have stood up while be addressing said know single word of what be saying to thank for kindness then shook hand with chief to whom that form of greeting be evidently new patted on shoulder chief then conducted to large house be higher than rest be built of stone well fitted together roof be roughly thatched must roger thought afford poor shelter in time of rain did not know except at commencement of storm rain be of comparatively rare occurrence upon coast inside house showed sign of comfort there be seat decorated with carving finely woven mat covered floor arm utensil hung from wall several of native evidently person of consideration in village followed chief in girl woman came in from interior room saluted stranger with greatest respect examined timidly one of younger girl touching hand gently a if to make sure that be skin not strange covering gave color roger took off jacket be by time dry turned up sleeve of shirt a did so general exclamation of surprise admiration broke from native at whiteness of skin be far more striking to than bronzed hue of face hand chief made various sign roger at last understood to be question a to whence have come pointed in direction of sea tried to signify that have arrived from very long distance hour passed roger be beginning to wonder what next move must be when native entered saluting chief said something to woman child at once retired few minute afterwards chief went to door motioned roger to accompany coming down street of village be procession at head walked two person evidently of high rank wore mantle falling from shoulder nearly to ground ornamented with design executed in brightly colored feather have circlet of gold round head heavy necklace bracelet of same metal beneath mantle wore short petticoat of soft white material spear arm be carried behind by attendant behind came number of men woman walking in regular order carrying bowl of fruit tray of cooked food other offering roger saw at once that must have come from place of importance must be near at hand a have doubtless set out upon receipt of message dispatched by present entertainer guessed that report must have be favorable one of that native be impressed with idea that be superior being be therefore needful for to comport so that impression must be confirmed chief bowed profoundly a approached stooping so far forward that one hand touched earth be then carried to forehead roger did not understand meaning of bowed graciously a if accepting homage be offered bearer then advanced placed offering on ground among be mantle similar to worn by chief more richly embroidered struck roger that a white skin excited so much admiration must be a well to show be too somewhat ashamed of garment be much worn have turned dingy hue from sun salt water have moreover shrunk much from recent immersion taking up robe therefore motioned to chief to stay where be returning into room stripped to waist then throwing mantle over shoulder returned to entrance something like shout of welcome saluted whiteness of skin a seen through open mantle astonished native accepted assumption of garment with have be presented a sign of benevolent intention of supernatural visitor towards ambassador now made sign in direction from have come seemed to ask if be willing to accompany nodded assent in few minute procession again started chief taking place one on side of villager falling in behind woman struck up sort of chant in except chief joined for hour kept on way then on ascending small hill large town be seen tabasco chief said pointing towards roger repeated word in doing so evidently gave much pleasure to chief a approached town must see many lofty building rising above a passed through line of long palisade surrounded place body of men issued out to meet a approached formed in order on side of road be armed with spear tipped with sharp shiny stone carried bow arrow be dressed in doublet of thickly quilted cotton capable of turning arrow resisting thrust of native spear although must offer poor protection against english arrow english weapon a entered town street be lined with similarly dressed soldier behind whom stood crowd of native men woman saluting strange visitor with loud cry of welcome procession continued way until stopped before large building at entrance to stood aged chief mantle be completely composed of feather work plume of feather sprang from golden fillet encircled head behind be clustered number of inferior chief welcomed roger courteously gravely roger guessed at once that be superior to superstition of people that viewed with certain amount of suspicion roger bowed taking off jackknife hung in sheath from string at waist drew out presented to chief latter be evidently greatly struck by gift gold silver knew bright shining metal be altogether new to examined closely felt edge point then handed to chief behind to be examined by roger saw by manner that have be favorably impressed for weapon be a strange mysterious to a visitant chief undid large gold necklace that wore offered to roger who bowed clasped round neck chief now led inside house be similar on much larger scale to have before entered refreshment be placed before did not need thought better to eat of while be so doing animated conversation be maintained between chief follower after time chief made sign to to follow conducted to smaller house close by made sign to that be to consider a own mat have be already spread on ground rug made of quilted cotton for sleeping upon piled in corner vas of flower placed about room made ready for occupation old woman followed by two young girl came forward saluted to ground be slave whom chief have appointed to wait upon visitor sooner have chief left than perfect levee commenced went on for hour until seemed to roger man woman child in town must have called upon most of brought little present a token of goodwill garland of flower be thrown round neck basket of fruit cake made from maize flour dish of meat of various kind little trinket of gold basket containing bean many other eatable seed ground powder of brownish hue of whose us roger be ignorant afterwards discovered to be cocoa furnished most popular beverage of native not until be quite dark did stream of visitor cease then old slave dropped hanging across door one of young one brought forward to roger who be utterly worn out with fatigue of day bowl of steaming cocoa cake of fruit roger found cocoa extremely palatable wholly unlike anything have ever before tasted seemed to invigorate greatly after drinking spread of quilted mat upon floor threw down upon old woman have lighted lamp withdrawn with younger one to apartment behind served a sleeping place a well a kitchen now that be alone have time to think roger broke down entirely be possible that be morning be on board ship with father friend now be gone gone forever be in strange land cut off from hope of return surrounded by people who if be friendly today might yet for aught knew slay on morrow for time however own fate occupied little thought turned almost exclusively upon father upon voyage together kindness care for high hope have cherished when started upon voyage above upon parting word last gesture of farewell just a ship struck for hour roger lay sobbed at last heard slight movement in room looking up saw one of young slave girl regarding with look of deep pity to a to everyone else roger have appeared a supernatural being come

more than there be of forgetting can trust if live do well in country will send for will tell people that have be a sister to will see that mother of yours doe justice that will come to own again will marry cazique of own choice if hear from will know that thing have gone badly with that have be sacrificed to god that be held a slave have power whatever to help malinche said more dark eye be full of tear with habit of submission natural to mexican woman simply took roger hand placed against forehead malinche will wait said then hurried from room before leaving roger gave malinche several of handsomest of bracelet necklace have be bestowed on in first flush of popularity at tabasco gave present also to old woman two girl wept bitterly when said goodbye to roger have to fight hard to restrain tear be a bad said to a be saying goodbye to dorothy agnes color doe not matter much after malinche be just a good kind a if be white cazique conducted roger to anahuac encampment have that morning made various present of robe mantle for be very desirous that visitor must part in goodwill from again impressed upon fact that only parted with because felt that must not protect from ill will of of people merchant made secret of satisfaction a soon a have handed to cazique good slave have agreed to give in exchange for roger have like cazique pretended to be indifferent a to bargain have haggled with over term of purchase party be equally desirous of concluding agreement while cazique considered that be making excellent bargain for visitor who have voluntarily placed in hand merchant be still more delighted in first place mexican be a malinche have told roger looking for arrival of quetzalcoatl of white descendant of from sea if roger be to turn out to be expected god honor must fall upon a producer must be great indeed even must not prove so must gain great credit to say nothing of profit by bringing home so singular being who must either be received in high honor by king must be one of most acceptable sacrifice ever offered to god a soon therefore a cazique have left addressed roger in term of high respect presented to of most handsome feather robe tiara with plume ornament arm to stupefaction roger replied in own language a be in ignorance that cazique possessed countrywoman of own among slave regarded a miracle of most singular kind a indisputable proof

at roger disposal merchant contenting with smaller one raised beside number of slave be told off to attend upon meal be served with greatest ceremony deference night a roger lay upon soft pile of quilted rug prepared for mind be sorely troubled a to position be right in allowing to deceive into belief that be supernatural being ought not rather to tell that god worshiped be false that there be one true god who be worshiped by white men thinking over in way concluded at last that there be necessity for at present to undeceive anahuans must do good by doing so must ensure own destruction resolved however that nothing must induce to pay honor to god to take part in bloody sacrifice can kill if will said be not going to be false to religion if must not kill may be able in time to persuade that god be false for present must be madness to try to do so from what malinche said be devoted to religion priest be powerful if be to do good therefore must be done gradually what must think at home if indian be to arrive to try teach that god be false one why must be burnt at stake in time one can not expect that indian must be more patient in such matter than must when spaniard

then asked do like be really pleasant to be indeed governor said herb be largely used effect be to produce feeling of repose contentment will get to like in time possibly may roger replied although at present hardly seems probable music now struck up more lively air presently number of young men woman who have be feasting in apartment came in performed several graceful dance to accompaniment of

common here that be more than if at home one presented man with necklace of glass woolen cloth be mark of civility be when get there priest will be inquiring into religion when see that pay honor to god will be sure to raise cry against malinche be telling that year special prisoner be chosen for sacrifice be treated with great honor have luxury until time come then put to death brute have doubt will consider that from very rarity will make specially acceptable sacrifice wish be back on hoe again cousin diggory mistress mercy girl little think into what horrible fix have fallen alone among

two three of companion of swan with must feel must face came be hard to stand quite alone be only boy still will find can strike rough blow two before die will not find that be lamb that be going to sacrifice devonshire lad with such bone muscle a one get from life on sea be strange that people must be so cruel seem so mild so gentle yet malinche say sacrifice ten of thousand of captive year to god never kill in battle if can avoid striving only to take enemy prisoner for horrible service must try if can to make friend among old cazique of tabasco stood by well may be that here may find like will need powerful protector indeed to stand against priest who malinche say be far more powerful here than in tabasco three hour later attendant came in said that governor invited guest to walk with through town survey temple other edifice now for roger said clenching fist now roger hawkshaw have got to show true man come of fastened sword be one of weapon with have be presented to girdle then went out into great hall from other apartment opened governor two noble from tezcuco be awaiting upon sallying out roger found that street be a crowded a when entered be received with long quavering cry of welcome by woman by deeper hum of applause by men bent to ground before companion before whom party of soldier moved to clear way now will go first to great temple governor said be small in comparison with of great city of valley be very holy shrine number come from city round to pay devotion there on day of festival there be forty temple in town on of fire burn night day be largest holiest of after passing through several street roger saw great hill rising in front of whether be work of man have natural hill for foundation knew not be four sided pyramidal in form there be terrace rising one above other supported by stone wall step at angle led from one terrace to be so placed that anyone mounting have to pas right along terrace round pyramid before arrived at step leading to above top of pyramid seemed to be cut off leaving area of a far a must judge fifty foot square smoke ascended from summit where a malinche have told fire always burn before altar in center just before reaching foot of pyramid governor pointed to building of considerable size here will see said leading roger towards great gateway how well god have be honored a neared gateway roger saw that building be well nigh filled with immense pile carefully built up of what at first appeared to cannon ball only of larger size than have seen piled in battery of plymouth of white color then thought struck be great turnip such root might be held sacred to god a entered building truth flashed across great pile be composed entirely of human skull roger have made up mind that although must not give way in slightest in matter of faith must yet abstain from shocking religious feeling of native after first involuntary start at discovery silenced feeling asked how many skull there be in heap must not however understand reply a have not yet mastered aztec method of enumeration be very complicated one roger walked along one side of pile counted number of skull in line number of row then tried to reckon how many skull there be roger be not quick at figure although father have tried hard to teach to calculate rapidly a be necessary for one who traded bought sold good of description to be able to keep own figure must otherwise be forced always to carry supercargo a be indeed custom in almost trading ship for there be few master who must read write far le keep account however a found there be hundred skull in line ten row a heap be nearly square be not difficult task to arrive at conclusion that there must be hundred thousand skull in pile seemed to beyond belief yet must arrive at other conclusion if hundred thousand victim have be offered up in one temple of comparatively small city what must be total of men killed throughout country pile have doubt be long time in growing perhaps hundred year even then must give thousand victim yearly in one temple although seemed well nigh impossible to roger be yet by mean excessive for according to account of historian mexican spanish number of victim slain annually on altar of mexico amounted to from twenty five to fifty thousand god have good reason to be pleased aztec ambassador who be watching roger face closely remarked if be fond of blood sacrifice must indeed be pleased roger said quietly god love slaughter quetzalcoatl god of air who loved men taught what know god must abhor sacrifice of blood offering of fruit flower taught men to grow of art in instructed must be vastly more pleasing to than human victim roger spoke in tone of authority a if be sure of what stated when white god left shore there be human sacrifice offered to god fact roger have learned from malinche who have told that custom have be introduced in comparatively late year said ten generation supposed must mean about two hundred year custom must be abhorrent to aztec governor looked very grave be to god of war that sacrifice be offered idea that kindly white god who stood next to in public estimation might not only object to be so worshiped might object altogether to human sacrifice being offered be unpleasant to yet white stranger clearly spoke a if be acquainted with mind of tezcucan envoy on other hand looked pleased tezcuco have maintained for long time milder form of worship people be more gentle than aztec have only reluctantly in part adopted terrible rite of formidable neighbor will ascend temple governor asked roger said firmly say not aught against god of battle let who will make offering to god of air roger raised hand towards sky love flower fruit peace goodwill when came down to earth preached peace must have have men a brother who follow will not bow down at altar where human being have be sacrificed mexican naturally thought that roger be speaking of quetzalcoatl strange knowledge possessed of god way wish struck with deep awe without making further attempt to induce to ascend teocalli be name gave to pyramidal temple governor led way back to palace next morning roger started with tezcucan envoy on journey informed on way that aztec governor have on previous evening dispatched officer of high rank to mexico to give emperor full detail of conversation saying of strange visitor for dispatch be available only for sending news of fact occurrence must not be used a medium for conveying thought montezuma be mild gentle in disposition quite unlike two predecessor who be mighty warrior doubtless in heart will welcome word said yesterday concerning quetzalcoatl be swayed wholly by priest such sentiment will not be agreeable to for sacrifice be forever going on at teocalli at dedication of great temple for huitzilopotchli just thirty year ago seventy thousand captive be put to death must have be miserable creature roger said indignantly to have submitted tamely to such fate might at least have rushed upon guard however numerous died fighting roger said little more during day journey admiration have at first felt for art civilization of people have be succeeded by feeling of abhorrence have heard from malinche that victim sacrificed to god be afterwards cooked eaten although have scarcely believed girl in spite of solemn assurance must now after seeing vast pile of human skull quite believe that be true chapter at tezcuco in city through passed several of be of vastly greater size importance than tepeaca roger be received with same welcome rejoicing have greeted there house be decorated with flower garland dense crowd lined street procession came out to meet banquet be given in honor everything seemed gay joyous roger be low depressed to whole thing appeared mockery seemed to see blood everywhere fact that a learned from casual remark of one of envoy number of victim be offered upon altar on evening before arrival at town in order to please god bring about favorable omen added to depression thought that have better thousand time have be drowned with father friend than be cause of men being thus put to death be true that a be told captive be reserved for purpose have not be slain on night might have be sacrificed on next be small consolation seemed to that above joyful cry of greeting must hear scream of agony of victim to such pitch be wrought up that have seen whom must have recognized a priest must have fallen upon with sword priest held aloof from gathering knew not a yet how chief must regard stranger be not policy to join in welcoming one who might afterwards be denounced sacrificed a enemy of religion upon other hand must commit to hostility to one who might be held to be god from summit of teocallis looked

telling white people be divided into nation a be people on side of water however be much more powerful than others while in time of peace port of different country be open to ship of others there be two country claim right over great sea although a yet untraveled unknown how can claim right a one of two chief counselor asked partly by right that have be first to try to make discovery in sea secondly because one of country be strongest at present time thirdly because have be confirmed in claim by pope who be chief priest of religion be held in common among white people to spaniard be assigned that vast space of water lying towards setting sun belong to nation country be called england be great island divided into two kingdom of ours be larger be people great fighter yes have fought many obstinate war with nation lying on mainland opposite to men have beaten theirs when have outnumbered many fold at present be at peace found that while must beat in battle must not continue to hold country lay separated from by sea be friend with spaniard also yes have never warred with spain king have a wife princess of country trading at spanish port learned that there be rumor among spaniard far to west lay great people possessing vast store of gold rich of kind so father who be captain of one of floating castle determined to sail across sea in despite of spaniard rule endeavor to perform adventure of discovering if possible great nation what must have happened if spaniard have met a passed through water have succeeded in taking ship must have killed without mercy have strong crew must have matched willingly enough against spanish ship however big that interfered with what became of ship struck during gale on coast of tabasco be dashed to piece father on board be drowned god protected be thrown ashore unhurt being doubtless intention must live to be first white man to see great country to bring to news of white people beyond sea know story about god

arrival of white with fear father who be full of learning wisdom predicted when on deathbed that white people must shortly arrive from sea must overthrow anahuac kingdom be strange indeed that within three year of death must appear be strange roger agreed assuredly majesty father prophecy did not allude to people be comparatively small nation be not even master of whole of island have not one ship to fifty that spaniard posse have desire for foreign conquest be strong if attacked even spain must find hard matter did endeavor to conquer must not dream of challenging right exercise over sea to

mounted soldier whose rush impetus in battle be nigh impossible even for white infantry who have fear of horse be clad in armor to withstand that have in addition terrible cannon of spoke to think must twenty thousand of spaniard land here must be irresistible however think that there be chance of such army being brought against rich powerful a spain be expense of preparing such expedition ship required to carry must be so vast that think must undertake moreover be always so occupied with war at home that must not spare such force for distant expedition therefore think have ground for alarm in present believe that in very short time spanish ship may arrive at port will open trade with people wonder that have not long since found way here trade must be beneficent to have many commodity must be most useful to have others that must prize greatly what be product must most value king asked first most of gold roger said be with scarcest most valuable of metal thing be valued by a with bag of cocoa be standard of value so with be piece of gold wide estate be worth so much gold ship horse suit of armor so many piece of gold so through everything delicate embroidery work must be

thus enclosed in metal roger admitted that in hot climate like of mexico heat must be terrible pointed out that men so clad be carried on horse have occasion for movement save of arm a there be joint in armor at shoulder must be moved in way with freedom there can not be much bravery required to fight when protected in way by metal queen said number be killed nevertheless roger replied armor strong a be will not resist missile fired from cannon helmet be part protects head can be beaten in by blow with heavy mace moreover when two party similarly armed charge shock be so terrible that horse rider be alike thrown to ground when thrown down may be trampled to death by horse killed by footman before can recover foot still there be many who think that day armor will be given up

word have spoken be true that have real feeling of friendliness towards that sympathy be with rather than with people of other white nation others must not see so even a be there be sure to be party against be known that nation possibly hostile of color be short distance away nothing must save must be sacrificed at once to god therefore a for sake of nation have decided that what have told will remain profound secret to ourselves so for own sake pray henceforth to say nothing to of what have told let men think what like a to how have reached shore preserve sort of mystery a to yourself there be reason why must not speak even then guardedly of wonder of land inhabited by white men many month sail across sea be best that a little must be said a possible montezuma be sure to wish to see before visit will again take counsel together will to best of power carry out majesty order roger said fully recognize wisdom indeed at tabasco upon journey to merchant to envoy have said word

that audience be over that roger be to retire a have be instructed by cacama withdrew keeping face to emperor be conducted to different apartment here table be laid be served by attendant of court who

be of same opinion even priest be divided among montezuma be a undecided at end a be at beginning so that decision be postponed then question arose be to be treated a guest a prisoner settled by saying must take back with to tezcuco produce required so in order to avoid excitement among people sent word for boat to be brought round to quiet entrance to palace by mean avoided passing through street altogether at one time seemed to that decision must go against on ground have be supernatural being must have have new art to teach people fortunately have brought with picture made for wife sister showed pointed out that be altogether different from work of own scribe that drew stiff image that looked like representation not of men animal of wooden creature while in drawing seemed a if men animal be moving across paper that be to teach scribe thus to portray object must make profound alteration in mexican art made great impression upon many of noble belonging to council of education be present montezuma be fond of art be greatly struck with painting certainly went long way towards strengthening party when get back will do picture of thing such a see here be accustomed to perhaps must do even better still if be to try must make much more finished picture roger said be only sketched off in haste with such color a came to hand if have pigment must mix color a wanted must produce very much better effect roger a child have be placed by father during latter long absence from home at school kept by monk at monastery at plymouth in order that might learn to read write a accomplishment must be of great use to a master mariner fondness for painting attracted attention of one of old monk who illuminated missal have permitted to copy many of manuscript in monastery have given instruction in art have indeed be so struck with talent boy showed that told reuben hawkshaw that if must let son devote to art must make famous painter sailor have scoffed at idea roger fond a be of painting must have be reluctant to abandon idea of going to sea instruction have obtained however up to age of twelve when went on first voyage with father have be of great assistance to thanks to natural talent visit to church at various port at ship touched to fact that have plenty of time on board to practice art picture be surprisingly good have excited great deal of attention on part of friend acquaintance of master diggory beggs upon return to tezcuco cacama ordered scribe to furnish with large sheet of best paper brush pigment color be bright glaring one by mixing adding sombre dye obtained in market roger succeeded in getting required tint taking place in garden at point where commanded lake near at hand dotted with canoe city of mexico with background of hill in distance roger set to work to surprise of scribe who have be ordered to assist mixed color with oil instead of water then began picture worked a long a there be sufficient light recommenced next morning directly after sunrise continued at work day by evening have finished picture three foot by two although must not be considered remarkable in europe excited most lively admiration on part of cacama lady explained to king that a have none of spirit be used in conjunction with oil to make dry rapidly must be day before picture must be sufficiently dry to be touched cacama however sent off next morning under charge of principal scribe to montezuma who sent back word that be astonished indeed at work of art seemed to to be almost magical sent in return large golden goblet to roger in token of satisfaction cacama be summoned to council on following day returned saying that picture have quite turned scale in roger favor that have be examined by chief scribe men of science who agreed that such thing have be seen before that person who be thus able to turn a be leaf of paper into mirror to fix upon representation of scene just a eye beheld must be possessed of power altogether strange supernatural desired to know whether must teach method to of chief scribe of emperor cacama warmly congratulated roger on result be now safe for present at rate said priest be silenced may have trouble in future for time montezuma love of art have overcome doubt fear a to good evil omen will have to take up residence in mexico hardly think so cacama replied tezcuco be still acknowledged center of art science of anahuac here be best school of scribe come here to be instructed in hieroglyphic writing from part of kingdom moreover in way montezuma will have le uneasiness concerning will think that even if omen be unfavorable there will be no danger so long a be at distance from capital therefore think be more likely to order of scribe to take up residence here for time than be to bid to cross to teach there such in fact be purport of message received from montezuma on following day six of most accomplished scribe of mexico be to proceed at once to tezcuco there to be instructed in new art next day roger found established in room in palace with six aztec scribe six of most celebrated for skill in attendant be told off to mix color under direction to purchase for in market kind

difficulty in preserving gravity at thus undertaking charge of art school at first confined to sketching from model with burnt stick on white paper in seeing that pupil did same drawing have hitherto be purely conventional have always drawn man in certain way not because saw so because be way in have be taught to draw have great difficulty in getting to depart altogether from line to draw model

evening spent hour upon lake sometimes in large canoe with gay party boat decked with flower while at short distance boat with musician followed in wake melody be by mean agreeable to roger when close coming softly across water with cuitcatl a guide roger visited school where young noble be educated reminded much of at have for five six year be taught also frequently witnessed drilling of soldier be of very simple character consisting principally in teaching to move together in mass to shoot with bow bow be light arrow small roger thought that must scarcely be very formidable weapon even against men clad in quilted cotton for although might wound annoy must seldom kill one evening about five month after arrival roger have just returned from excursion upon lake cuitcatl be seated in latter room sipping chocolate when hanging of door be drawn aside suddenly amenche entered with exclamation of surprise two young men rose to foot saluted deeply must fly exclaimed to roger at once royal boat have just come from mexico with two noble guard have order to carry back with news have arrived that several floating castle filled with white men with strange arm animal have arrived on coast secret council have be held montezuma be full of alarm priest have decided that be undoubtedly spy must be sacrificed at once to god happened to be behind hanging heard what be said hurried away to warn there be not moment to lose go round to garden conceal in shrubbery near eagle house will tell cacama where be will come send down to to say what have best be done where be to go delay instant

emptied from drawer where be lying gold ornament present have received tied in cloth caught up sword then with cuitcatl hurried down passage just a reached end saw party appear at other extremity preceded by official carrying torch be just in time young noble said princess have saved life in two three minute be in garden keeping carefully in shade of shrub so a to escape view of who might be sitting at window on flat roof of palace enjoying lovely evening bright moonlight made way cautiously down to eagle house lay at other end of garden nearly mile from palace whole thing have come so suddenly upon roger that must scarcely believe even now that pleasant tranquil time have come to end be in danger of being dragged away instantly sacrificed scarce word be spoken until reached spot indicated close to grew large patch of bamboo will take refuge here for present cuitcatl said be hardly likely will search garden at night must need army to do so thoroughly if hear footstep approaching can take refuge inside meantime let seat here must be people told of first night came doubt be so cuitcatl have best return at once to chamber will be missed a well a will must be suspected that have share in flight if must make escape emperor vengeance may fall on pray leave at once must be most unhappy if misfortune brought trouble upon have be like brother to since came here must not think of leaving young noble said firmly can do more good by going cuitcatl will see what be taking place there may throw off scent while here can do good whatever indeed might do harm be found here with must be forced to surrender without striking blow for must be afraid to resist lest must bring harm upon whereas if be alone must fight to death rather than surrender besides will be able to consult princess can bring down such thing a may consider will aid in flight though how be to escape search there will be after be more than can guess pray go at once for sooner go sooner can bring back news of what be being done up there cuitcatl saw justice of roger reasoning may at least throw off scent said see about preparing for flight promise to hide in bamboo there if searcher must come in direction certainly do will do in power to conceal will only fight if there be other way cuitcatl at once glided noiselessly off keeping a before in shadow of bush for hour half roger remained alone be sitting under shadow of bamboo must in moment withdraw among at last thought heard slight noise drew back towards thick cane moment later however stepped forward a figure at once recognized advanced across patch of moonlight from next clump of shrub be well so far cuitcatl said directly entered palace attendant told that be being inquired for proceeded straight to royal apartment

bathalda speedily made fire by rubbing two stick together after skinning bear cut up while roger be superintending roasting of piece over fire bathalda searched in wood speedily returned with root placed in ash turned out excellent eating with bear flesh a be now far on in afternoon a have already performed very fatiguing day work resolved to wait where be until morning what do think must be best course now roger asked after have eaten meal be stretched close to fire for warmth for at elevation cold be great bathalda did not reply sat pouring out volume of smoke from pipe have just filled at last roger repeated question be ready to go where lord will yes bathalda be answer to question know way of people have have sharp fight with today what be likely to come of bathalda shook head news will long before have be sent by swift runner to town village on slope of mountain garrison of perote tlatlanquitepec xalapa naulinco will be in movement naulinco be eight ten mile away down pas not only soldier man in town will be ordered out will be posted a thick a blade of grass at mouth of valley leading down from mountain have resisted emperor officer have killed number of soldier will know that wrath of montezuma will be terrible if fail to arrest then think that will almost be impossible to make way through bathalda nodded head in time suppose will search wood foot of wide though be lord then what be advice bathalda depends whether lord mind be altogether set upon joining white men of sea at once roger in turn be silent for time spaniard must have learned wealth of land be not likely must speedily depart if did must only be to return again in far greater force than at present other opportunity must occur for rejoining must be folly to throw away life that of companion in attempt that latter evidently felt to be desperate have already have proof of vigilance of aztec scout doubtless that vigilance must now be redoubled bathalda replied at last must be content to remain in hiding for time to risk departure of white men then lord advice be that retrace step across to other side of mountain then will head north avoiding town take refuge for time in forest stretch for many league over mountain there can build hut hunt there be turkey other game in abundance from time to time can go down to town gather news bring back such thing a may be necessary for then when search for abates can strike down thence to seacoast if white men be still there at rate can live by hunting a long a may find necessary to remain in concealment will be by far best plan bathalda have objection to few week of life in wood can teach craft of hunter what do say will start back evening if lord be not too wearied must be well if must get across crest before morning will have sentry at point whence can command view of hill figure must be made out on snow at great distance away must have preferred night rest bathalda must be foolish to lose day doubt party will be searching wood in morning have still four hour before sun go down must be enough to fit for starting again hunter be pleased at roger decision let lord sleep at once said will watch be accustomed to long journey to pas night in search of game be nothing to used dry stick for fire little smoke will have made way through tree still may possibly be noticed be best one of must remain on watch roger felt that must never be able to make ascent over crest of hill unless have rest therefore without argument wrapped in cotton mantle lay down before fire seemed to that have just closed eye when companion touched be time that must be moving lord sun have just set why appears to to be night already bathalda have be dark here for last hour lord on other side of mountain sun have now gone down see full moon have just risen in east be so bathalda will have light till morning well be ready though must have slept on comfortably until sunrise have heard anything have heard sound of horn far down hillside nothing near save animal disturbed by voice below passing up towards rock have cooked more flesh be always best to make good meal when one can have rough journey before cold will be great fortunately air be still be blowing must say that there be le danger in waiting here than in crossing mountain meal be quickly eaten bathalda slung large piece of bear flesh over shoulder started so bright be moonlight that have more difficulty in climbing than if have be day after six hour of severe toil again came down upon forest on other side of mountain proceeded among tree for little distance till came to very thick undergrowth where bathalda thought must be perfectly safe to light fire accordingly did a roger said must rather run danger than go without fire in spite of exertion have made be chilled to bone clothes be stiff with frozen moisture from body cotton mantle offered small protection against cold pleasant glow stole over a fire burnt up will watch now bathalda will sleep think that there be danger lord believe among wood on other side of mountain be not at likely there will be vigilant watch kept upon side can sleep without fear roger be glad to hear companion opinion in few minute be fast asleep when awoke be day bathalda be cooking flesh over ember of fire have be asleep hope bathalda roger said a rose to foot shook have slept lord hunter said although in fact be not until morning began to break that have relaxed watchfulness will be off a soon a have eaten be possible that party may a soon a be daybreak go along by edge of snow line to assure that be still on other side of mountain if so will probably come across footstep therefore have best be moving at once two long day march took deep into wood lying north of tlatlanquitepec here set to work to construct rough hut of bough near mountain spring when be completed set to work hunting turkey abounded generally obtained by shooting at night a roosted in tree sometimes hunted by day bathalda imitating call so accurately that came up within easy shot of without least suspicion of danger killed several small bear be useful not only for flesh for warmth of skin at night once twice shot deer obtained other game in abundance at night frequently heard roar of mountain tiger once twice when sound approached too close to hut left took refuge in tree a hunter said that even roger arrow must scarcely slay fierce beast at once that when wounded be terrible enemy roger enjoyed life much air be fresh bracing forest magnificent in varied foliage abundance of game so great that needed special exertion to keep well supplied with food two three time at interval of week ten day bathalda went down to tlatlanquitepec with load of turkey other game slung on pole over shoulder returned with maize flour chocolate pulque other article of food be of much greater importance to roger news of white stranger first time learned that have arrived in several floating castle have landed at once native have received with kindness chief of district teuhtlile have on following day have interview with chief present have be exchanged five day later embassy with many very rich gift from emperor arrived at

have erected altar to own god there act have created profound impression throughout country greatest astonishment be felt that montezuma did not at once put army in motion to crush profane insolent stranger still greater sensation have be caused by news that spaniard have destroyed floating castle that be therefore evident that intended to remain permanently in land news greatly surprised roger report be unanimous that there be at utmost three four hundred of white that spaniard must dream of matching against whole force of mexico seemed almost incredible how do white men communicate with native roger asked have with slave whom obtained at tabasco among be one who be mexican by race say that white men speak to white man who understands language of tabasco that speaks to young woman who speaks in mexican what be told be treated with great honor by white men what be name did hear native say be called malinche white men call marina be good news indeed bathalda roger said for when be at

opportunity of meeting bathalda do now make way back to tezcuco tell lord have happened that be with spaniard will accompany if a believe go forward to mexico hope to see friend again before long always think of kindness to chapter massacre of cholula tlascalans have from moment when admitted beaten by spaniard laid aside hostility have indeed accepted alliance with enthusiasm have right to be proud of own valor for have resisted attempt of great aztec monarchy to conquer have defeated with slaughter greatly superior force that mere handful of white men must be able to withstand attack day after day to defeat best hardiest troop led by general who have hitherto be always successful excited surprise admiration in highest degree be not god knew for have be killed in conflict a men seemed to infinitely superior in strength courage to that have before heard of be proud to enter into alliance with such hero moreover saw must now have opportunity of turning table upon enemy of plain did not believe for moment montezuma must admit white men to capital in case there must be great battle perhaps much plunder to be gained therefore when spaniard be again ready to advance whole fighting force of tlascala be placed at disposal cortez however declined to take with so large army appearance of force composed of bitter foe of aztec must have combined against whole strength of empire must have destroyed hope might remain of peaceful arrangement moreover difficulty of feeding so large body of men must be great indeed a authority over must be feeble constant broil with aztec must be inevitable result therefore with many thanks declined offer said that must gladly take with force of six thousand volunteer first march be to be to cholula whose people have sent warm invitation to cortez to visit montezuma by last envoy also requested to journey forward by way of city tlascalans have strongly urged to refuse invitation cholulans be said treacherous people not to be trusted be

great temple of god pyramid whose base covered forty four acre whose height be hundred eighty foot platform on summit where sacrifice took place being acre in size cortez however decided upon visiting cholula deemed report of tlascalans to be prejudiced a there be long standing animosity between two people thought that be to avoid visiting important town lay almost on road to mexico might be set down by aztec to distrust fear departure from tlascala be witnessed by whole of population of state who assembled to bid white men farewell to wish success upon way day march took to within mile two of cholula here be met by many noble from city who urged to enter that evening cortez bearing in mind warning have received thinking dangerous to enter street of unknown possibly hostile city after

when left city on way to mexico spaniard a entered cholula be greatly struck with appearance of city inhabitant being very much larger more highly civilized place than have yet met with building be

wasted treasure in vain must feel goodwill towards however will be prepared for continue search there may be change come montezuma may even now be preparing to crush if so a soon a people here know

here roger replied for if priest want victim so sorely seemed to that if ventured to leave palace dressed in spanish garb might be seized carried off be quite right cuitcatl agreed priest be furious against can not altogether blame general may a say come a ambassador from king to montezuma if have order to come to court at cost be not to blame if fought way whenever be opposed doe not justify in insulting religion even assaulting hurling down god at opportunity even tried to persuade emperor that god be false spoke insolently of yesterday when montezuma conducted at request into holy shrine cacama be one of strongest advisor that peaceful reception must be accorded to white visitor even be being greatly turned against by conduct towards god come will take to royal apartment leave in room

that did not avenge indignity offered to by white at cempoalla where image be hurled down from altar at cholula where most sacred of temple be attacked captured emblem of white god set up on summit roger hawkshaw warned against spaniard said that be cruel master to people have conquered above thing cruel in matter of religion forcing who came under sway to accept god under pain of death that

worth nothing go where be led believe what be last told shout when be told to shout have opinion of own upon aught what relates to among noble priest learned there be much division of opinion at present wait frankly at moment storm may follow calm priest who of course be bitterly hostile to stranger be without doubt working have great power with must say that on whole be safer here with than must be across water there mean that there be immediate danger must remember that montezuma have be insulted humiliated made to appear small in sight of people be one of proudest of men although at present feigns friendship with spaniard moment will come when will revolt against being thus bearded in capital have to wave hand for invader to be wiped out however let talk of other matter at present of course be not thinking of returning tonight intended to do so canoe in came be waiting for can not think of letting go cacama said decidedly will send official back with message from saying

when be at tabasco together have changed greatly during month have passed since saw yes think be certainly beautiful now not so beautiful a others have seen why did go to girl again persisted because

have guessed from dress from speaking language that be how came to be here have not seen malinche before saw must have recognized must no doubt have told cortez that have known from time be cast ashore near tabasco somewhat over two year ago must then have known must not be spaniard for if so must not in so short time have lost own language cacama now interposed asked many question about tlascala people of tlascalan prince cazique gave daughter a wife to spaniard did not six of did so roger replied lady be first baptized into christian religion then married by priest to a many of chief leader of spaniard what did think of cacama asked did not think much about roger said for be business of mine that of lady friend be certainly politic course on part of cortez tlascalans bound

twenty lack six year of yet be man cacama said gravely be man in size strength man in courage a well showed other day when be attacked by number of best soldier be thoughtful prudent year go for nothing be man even in year be not according to custom too young to marry now tell have heard much of bad business at cholula tell do think that there be treachery on part of people be mere pretext of spaniard to fall upon inhabitant sack town be sure that treachery be intended roger said learned from three people lady two priest cholula noble when taxed by cortez with intention to fall upon admitted that accusation be true besides whole people be under arm ready to attack poured out under leader to assault moment first gun told that intention be discovered there be doubt that general destruction of white men be intended although punishment inflicted be terrible can not say that be not justified under circumstance moreover knew that there be mexican army lying short distance away in readiness to enter town join in attack against be terrible error a well a crime on part of emperor if be true that be concerned in cacama said if so took one here into counsel acted wholly on advice of priest be where general considers danger lie must trust cazique for men of rank in country be faithful to word pretend friendship when mean hostility be montezuma guided by there must be fear of treachery a have given to priest can by mean of oracle persuade to almost anything cortez feel that danger be great well now have better to rest cacama said rising be to start with first streak of light so a to be back before sun be high be long past midnight now cuitcatl must think be well for to accompany friend rumor may have got abroad that be again guest who longed for blood before may long for again must not that must cross lake unattended be about to propose doing so young noble said know priest can guess at present white victim be what most of desire therefore will certainly accompany to mexico roger mexican friend be taken across lake in canoe rowed by four strong men be one of private canoe of palace without royal insignia used for conveyance of messenger

malinche from adjoining room be back earlier than expected said a soon a interpreter entered have serious news general cacama be friendly be unaware of treacherous design on part of emperor admits that situation be critical one that be possible influence of priest may again induce montezuma to take hostile action do think must count upon a ally think not sir although have not a yet sounded cacama have be very badly treated by montezuma by mean approves of emperor conduct throughout matter think that patriotism must overcome sense of private wrong can tell more farther on cacama have invited to stay with for present think might be of more use to there than here think so too cortez said indeed have not yet entered band regularly like rest be right that must have freedom of action especially a be only man among who know anything of mexican for even marina know nothing of side of mountain think that will run great risk in staying there alone marina asked on own account danger doubt malinche will be on guard cacama will take precaution for safety even priest must not venture to seize in palace tezcucans be far le bigoted than people of city think will be in much greater

diameter within few inch of center at height of three foot from ground arrow be sticking mexican be silent with astonishment mingled with certain amount of awe for shooting like seemed to to be supernatural said be not good shot king said be pure accident roger asserted might shoot twenty arrow not hit tree again have not least idea must do so only wished to show how far well made bow must send arrow when drawn by englishman cacama ordered arrow to be left in tree large stone to be placed at spot from roger have fired will remain said a memento of shot will introduce among people custom say prevails in country child will be bound to practice daily with bow arrow think that of race will ever come to use such weapon a may at least learn to bend bow greatly stronger than be accustomed to use will doubtless do so roger said be matter of practice of strengthening certain muscle of right arm for man far stronger than be must be unable to bend bow have not be trained to use from earliest age must recommend prince that not only give order have spoken of institute monthly gathering with prize for skill honor to best marksman in way must take interest in sport must become a popular among youth a be with again roger bow be passed round have seemed to bend so easily in hand that who have not tried before must scarce credit strength until have handled even most powerful men found that must only draw arrow few inch a walked towards terrace upon queen lady be standing cuitcatl said have intended to ask roger to try bout of sword play with of will not do so now after what have seen of strength of arm must be sorry indeed to stand up against even with blunted weapon with stick for there must be no resisting downright blow news came to of terrible blow struck by spaniard how clove through sword helmet head scarce credited before now can well believe to be true well maclutha cacama said what think of what have seen wonder who met with white men in battle said that have supernatural strength that even sturdy tlascalans must not resist will have bow hung up in armory with great gold chain will be reward of first man who can like friend draw arrow to head be wonderful queen said must be well indeed if a say youth of tezcuco must shoot like amenche said nothing cheek be flushed with excitement pleasure that evening when cacama be conversing alone with roger said friend know that tlascalan cazique have given daughter a wife to of spaniard be talking to of marriage last night what said about age be ridiculous be man warrior now offer hand of sister amenche love a maclutha have seen for time from what said gather that religion must not regard ceremony a binding did not accept god think must raise objection on score seeing a do that god have proved more powerful than ours roger be struck with astonishment at offer have regarded marriage a matter not to be thought of for many year until lately must have said that if ever did marry must be little cousin who have three year before said goodbye to at plymouth of late have felt charm of beautiful little princess since night when have come down to say farewell to in garden have felt hand tremble in have seen tear glisten on cheek in moonlight have thought good deal of chance of ever returning to england be comparatively slight danger of kind surrounded spaniard might be attacked massacred at moment if so must probably share fate if however be married to mexican princess brother in law of king of tezcuco must be regarded a one of people position must be high honorable one although life must be far different from to have hitherto looked forward might be very happy one sat in silence for two three minute after cacama have ceased speaking then said forgive prince for not responding at once to offer so far above desert of honor of be most deeply sensible there must be no greater happiness for man than to be husband of one so fair in way charming a princess amenche offer came upon altogether a surprise a have told have hitherto regarded a still lad marriage a event not to be thought of for year a regard youth a objection there be reason why must do so be of future that rather think seems to now must be content to settle down for life here with so charming wife can not say that might always be of mind love of country be strong in man time might come when if opportunity offered might long to return home to england have talked over with queen with amenche cacama said sister naturally must be sorry to leave own country if time came that must wish to return home must not hesitate to make sacrifice to accompany mexican woman when love be ready to give up everything for moment roger turned matter rapidly over in mind saw that even be disposed to refuse amenche hand indeed be not must be almost impossible for to do so must be deep offense to friendly prince must be cruel blow to girl who have confessed devotion for a to dorothy must have deemed dead year ago must ever return must find that have long since be married for daughter of wealthy merchant diggory beggs must not want for suitor held out hand to prince accept most gratefully offer cacama promise so far a in lie will do best to render sister happy to prove worthy of choice be heartily glad prince said warmly love sister have watched closely believe to be worthy of be sure that in will find not only friend brother wise counselor valiant leader of troop that with advice will be able to advance people in art of peace a well a war perhaps to win back father possession a to question of religion of spoke there be indeed difficulty grandfather great nezahualcoyotl wisest most powerful of monarch did not believe in aztec god built great temple dedicated to unknown god here worshiped did utmost to induce subject to abandon cruel worship of aztec god forbade sacrifice even of animal permitted only flower sweet scented perfume to be offered up on altar when after death aztec power increased that of tezcuco diminished people again embraced cruel faith of aztec father have be strong enough to set against priest a well a believed that grandfather be right that unknown god be ruler of world sister have of course be educated by priest know father opinion own have horror of human sacrifice belief that there must be greater better god than who be said to delight in blood so need not fear that will make difficulty a to accepting what tell her of white man god now will fetch in to think will be better to allow short time to pas to see how matter go in mexico before announcing to others approaching marriage if misfortune must happen to spaniard must at once publish news have ceremony performed without loss of time proclaiming to people although white be not of same race a spaniard if matter go on well montezuma will doubtless be present at niece marriage will of course invite malinzin officer prince left room in few minute returned with wife latter leading amenche by hand friend roger hawkshaw young king said gravely hereby promise to bestow upon hand of sister amenche may find in good loving obedient wife on part roger said taking girl hand queen held out to promise to be true loving husband to girl who have not raised eye since entered room looked up at tall figure with expression of perfect confidence will be true obedient said softly will love life what do do next in country cacama asked with smile be how engagement be sealed with roger said drawing girl up to stooped kissed lip three day later a roger be sitting with cuitcatl attendant entered said that king wished to see immediately hastened to royal apartment cacama be walking up down with angry frown upon face while queen princess be sitting on couch pale agitated strange news have come from mexico cacama said white men have seized montezuma be holding prisoner in quarter did anyone ever hear of such outrage mexico be in state of consternation at present none know what to do seems incredible roger exclaimed be sure of news quite certain prince replied news be indeed true cortez have found position unbearable believed that attack upon spaniard on coast a well a meditated treachery at cholula be outcome of emperor order native ally have heard rumor in town that bridge across canal be to be raised in case spaniard must be prisoner in palace be in mexican capital have a yet effected nothing towards conquest of country at moment might hear of landing of expedition from cuba that authority be revoked that be to reap benefit of have done therefore called council of most trusted officer discussed situation with agreed that step must at once be taken be in favor of starting night making way out of city before sufficient force must be collected to oppose retreat while others be of opinion that be better to retire openly with consent of montezuma whose conduct since have reached city appeared to be most friendly cortez pointed out that method must be retreat whole country must probably rise against moreover even if reached coast must have sacrificed have won by valor suffering proposed measure astonished even boldest companion namely that must go to royal palace bring emperor by persuasion if possible by force if necessary to quarter there hold a hostage for safety proposal be agreed to on following morning cortez asked for interview with emperor be at once granted proceeded to palace with principal officer ordering soldier to follow in group of two three so a not to attract particular attention montezuma began to converse with usual courtesy cortez roughly cut short charged with being author of attack upon garrison at port montezuma indignantly denied said that must send at once arrest author of attack cortez replied that be necessary for safety that montezuma must come reside among emperor be thunderstruck at proposal soldier crowded in loud threatening word be used montezuma in fear of life gave way have possessed of courage with be credited in youth must have called guard noble around died fighting having once given in assumed air of having done so voluntarily ordered litter to be brought in meantime attendant noble who have be present have spread news through city mexican catching up arm ran to rescue of monarch spaniard closed round litter have blow be struck emperor must doubtless have be murdered montezuma exhorted people to be tranquil assuring that be going willingly mexican accustomed to implicit obedience fearing that harm must come to emperor if struggle began drew back allowed spaniard to pas montezuma be conveyed prisoner into palace occupied by spaniard act be one of almost unparalleled boldness a performed upon monarch who be host of assailant with whom be previously on most friendly relation be act of treachery reflects dishonor upon fame of cortez at same time position occupied by spaniard be so strange even desperate a to palliate though can not excuse such course of action there be reason to believe that montezuma intended to act treacherously be under domination of priest have again changed mind a have already several time done nothing must have saved spaniard from absolute destruction honorable man must have acted a cortez did cortez be rough soldier moreover firmly held doctrine at time long afterwards held by spaniard in dealing with of other religion that faith need not be kept with heretic heathen chapter treasure room 't be infamous cacama said a paced up down room what be to be done hold in hand a hostage in heart of own capital among own people be capable of hanging from wall must hostile movement be made against be right roger hawkshaw in warning against men be without faith honor thus to seize host who have loaded with present who have emptied treasury to appease greed who have treated with most extraordinary condescension be crime unheard of act of base ingratitude without parallel what be to be done roger be silent such situation so strange unlooked for confounded must say cuitcatl burst out passionately that mexican must take up arm annihilate handful of invader what though montezuma fall better that monarch must perish than nation besides montezuma have shown unfit to govern be weakness have brought thing to pas think that white men must ever have advanced beyond plateau of tlascala have force of mexico barred way think that must ever have entered capital have be defended with resolution one moment flattered stranger loaded with gift next be ready to send force against cholulans have good reason for believing that designed annihilation of white if did not actually order attack upon so on seacoast have chief believed that montezuma be really friendly to white must ever have attacked there be two course open might from first have received spaniard frankly sent mission to escort honorably to capital might have called upon man in dominion to take up arm drive into sea took be who have brought here be better thousand time that must die than ruin must fall upon country advice be that troop be called out that messenger be sent to city in valley bidding send in contingent that march to aid people of mexico to annihilate handful of treacherous white men cacama be silent advice be in accordance with own feeling temperament extreme reverence with aztec regarded emperor paralyzed will see said gloomily in short time will know why montezuma thus tamely suhmitted to be made prisoner may have motif can not fathom can not believe to be coward aztec monarch yet have ever shown want of courage three four day later event occurred heightened fury of mexican against spaniard cazique who have attacked spaniard on coast arrived at mexico accompanied by son fifteen other chief who have acted with montezuma referred matter to examination of cortez cazique admitted part have taken in attack on spaniard did not seek to shelter under royal authority until sentence of death be passed on other chief when declared that have acted on authority of montezuma be condemned to be burnt alive in space in front of palace sentence be carried out not content with cortez placed iron upon montezuma saying there must now be no longer doubt a to guilt after execution be carried out montezuma be released from fetter news of insult to monarch created profound impression upon mexican although despised weakness of sovereign who appeared ready to suffer indignity yet to claim appearance of courtesy goodwill towards oppressor bolder spirit determined that nation must be no longer humiliated in person of sovereign that even must cost montezuma life effort must be made to overthrow oppressor a soon a news of execution of seventeen noble of indignity to montezuma be received cacama said to roger friend can no longer retain here have told why can not have proclaimed that be of different blood to spaniard quite understand motif there be two reason why in case must for time return to capital people must look upon with scorn did retain here a friend one whom regard a countryman of men who have so outraged moreover can not wish to stay have told that cortez have charged to acquaint with state of feeling in city be to remain here must be placed in painful position of giving information must ruin plan of deceiving man whom nominally serve know that must say nothing against must fail spaniard triumph cortez must accuse of being traitor must be put to death by therefore think in way best that must return there for present will of course inform cortez have sent back because feeling against white men on account of treatment of emperor be so great that felt must not protect against fury quite agree with cacama position here have become very painful one abhor a much a do doings of spaniard be perfectly ready to avow belong to nation to join in enterprise against that a have told cacama said must cut off chance of ever being able to return to own country be ready to accept that roger said firmly in marrying sister will become one of yourselves be ready to cast in lot with altogether prince be silent for minute two roger think that plan be best be to do a say spaniard must be at once placed on guard while save by strength of arm must aid little in enterprise against moreover if return to spaniard will have satisfaction that if fall ruin come upon house will take care of sister that wife will also have protector for reason therefore be better must go if aught be to be attempted against spaniard will take care to give notice so that can leave in disguise come here so avoid fate although roger own feeling must have led to throw in lot openly against spaniard saw that cacama plan be best boat be ordered to be at once got in readiness after painful parting with amenche who wept bitterly roger left palace again accompanied by cuitcatl in order to ensure safety across lake be taken over to mexico at once sought presence of cortez through marina explained to that cacama have sent back fearing that in excited state of population harm might come to have since have be in tezcuco sent letter across day to cortez saying that be tranquil there that young king be pursuing ordinary round of court ceremonial be certainly a far a must learn taking step towards interfering with affair of capital although imprisonment of montezuma have evidently made painful impression upon cortez asked few question when left room said to marina that young fellow must be watched marina have be brought up with people must to extent feel with know that be friend of yours see that say nothing to on public affair let be kept wholly in dark a to plan intention cacama be next to montezuma most powerful important of aztec chief be young energetic although have be so badly treated by montezuma resents treatment of have be otherwise must probably ere have made proposition to through sancho for closer alliance with on understanding that territory montezuma have taken from will be returned must have cacama action closely watched there be other aztec who be willing enough to act a spy who will keep informed of what be going on report have agreed with sancho from sending young fellow back here cacama may now be intending to act against cacama indeed lost time in setting to work began to form league with many of leading noble to rescue emperor destroy spaniard montezuma brother cuitlahua many others agreed at once to join greater part of aztec noble hung back upon ground that did not like to move in matter without order of emperor refusal prevented general rising taking place thus destroyed last chance of mexico retaining independence cortez learned from spy what be going on must have marched against tezcuco have not montezuma dissuaded telling that cacama be powerful prince must certainly be aided by many other chief that enterprise must be hazardous in extreme cortez then endeavored to negotiate received haughty answer from cacama then tried threat asserting supremacy of spanish emperor cacama replied that acknowledged such authority knew nothing of spanish sovereign people did wish to know anything of cortez then invited cacama to come to mexico to discus difference cacama have faith in spanish loyalty replied that when did visit capital must be to rescue a well a emperor common god from bondage must come not with hand upon breast on sword to drive out spaniard who have brought such disgrace upon country while have be going on montezuma have still further forfeited claim to sympathy by willingness with accepted attention of who be in fact gaoler paid outward mark of respect pretending still to regard a powerful sovereign in return be present at exercise sport took greatest interest in two ship be building for navigation on lake in respect behaved to a if be best friend now carried baseness still further informed cortez that several of tezcucan noble be regularly in pay that must be easy through to capture cacama thus break up confederacy cortez at once took mean to carry out suggestion traitor invited cacama to conference at house overhanging lake near tezcuco upon going there be seized by bound placed in boat carried to mexico be there brought before montezuma in spite of peril of position cacama bore nobly boldly accused uncle of foul treachery with cowardice have betrayed since spaniard have entered kingdom montezuma handed over to cortez who ordered to be loaded with fetter thrown into dungeon emperor then issued order declaring that cacama have forfeited sovereignty by rebellion that therefore deposed

be employed in religious dance alvarado gave signal men rushed upon with arm one of be massacred unresistingly not single soul escaping various motif be assigned for most foul massacre writer have ascribed solely to desire for plunder others to desire of alvarado to strike blow must intimidate mexican from making insurrectionary movement alvarado declared that have information that mexican intended to rise gave proof to justify suspicion affair indeed seems to have be utterly indefensible must ever remain foul blot upon spanish honor cortez be extremely angry at hearing what have taken place after listening to alvarado explanation said have done badly have be false to trust conduct have be that of madman be however time for quarrel a be impolicy of deed rather than treachery that angered cortez speedily forgave offender who be one of most popular officer in army blow alvarado have struck have contrary effect to have expected of sooner have news of massacre spread through city than whole population rose at dawn next morning attacked palace with desperate fury volume of missile be poured upon defender wall be assaulted work set on fire palace might have be taken have not montezuma yielding to entreaty perhaps threat of garrison mounted wall urged people to desist from attack a own safety must be imperiled did continue obeyed a usual withdrew from assault threw up work round place proceeded to starve spaniard out latter have considerable store of food suffered severely from thirst until be fortunate enough to discover spring be thus enabled to hold out until arrival of cortez latter refused to comply with request of montezuma to see have reason to doubt good faith of emperor for have discovered that latter have sent envoy to narvaez have upon arrival at tlascala be informed that rising at mexico have be to great extent prepared beforehand by order of montezuma even assurance of officer of garrison that owed safety to emperor intervention did not pacify real reason doubt of anger be that found have overrated advantage must gain from montezuma being in hand for not emperor be to blame at first capture have success that have expected from people have obeyed emperor a implicitly when captive a when power have be supreme have sent in noble prisoner bound at order have built ship for stranger have suffered to go unmolested through country there be end even to aztec patience avarice of white men have drained country of wealth arrogance have humiliated pride occupation of holiest temple insult to god have aroused to fury massacre in cold blood of six hundred of noble while engaged in religious devotion have be signal for explosion emperor formerly so venerated now regarded with contempt a creature of spaniard a betrayer of country thought of safety no longer restrained thirst for vengeance cortez however be in mood to reflect what have to do with dog of king exclaimed who suffers to starve before eye go tell master people said fiercely to mexican to open market will do for at cost chief who be bearer of montezuma message left presence in deep resentment reported to emperor to people outside manner in montezuma request for interview have be refused cortez however thought politic to release cuitlahua montezuma brother who have be among imprisoned for taking share in cacama league allowed to go into city thinking that must allay tumult cuitlahua be man of different spirit from brother be heir presumptive to throne bold daring prince people welcomed at once a montezuma representative chose to represent emperor during confinement cuitlahua accepted post immediately set to work to organize fighting men to arrange plan of attack roger have not be with party accompanied cortez on expedition against narvaez with two companion remained to form part of garrison of palace be out of spirit young fellow juan said on day after cortez have marched away be changed very much since first joined have much to make so juan roger replied in broken spanish see be white by blood have dear friend among native what do see a white perceive that position here be one of gravest danger destruction may fall upon a friend of native see country plundered people trodden down sooner later ruin misery of whole people mean be in danger from narvaez people juan said have faith in cortez will either fight bring over be wonderful man will find way out of difficulty mean entirely roger replied mean that there be danger from native pooh old soldier said disdainfully native be better than so many woman even woman may be serious opponent when be fifty to one juan mistake mexican have be friendly submissive because have be order of emperor although physically not strong be brave aztec army have spread dominion of mexico over wide extent of country have conquered many people be by mean to be despised be true beat tlascalans be not because be braver than be because of superior arm armor above by terror inspired by horse will not last mexican now know that be men like when fight inspired by national spirit memory of wrong tell that will have hard work to hold own ah well juan grumbled if must come must will not disturb appetite when roger learned that order have be given for massacre at temple determined firmly that must take part in deed might cost to refuse fortunately found difficulty in persuading one of soldier told off to act a guard at palace during absence of rest to change place with a man wanted to have share in expected plunder have cacama be at liberty roger must not have hesitated moment must have left spaniard thrown in lot with mexican now be impossible to do so frenzied population must have seized white man came upon outside wall of palace must have carried to altar of god must be hopeless to endeavor to explain that be of race white men must be alike in eye bitterly regretted now that have returned from tezcuco have at time gone with queen princess to house of friend cuitcatl must have remained there in quiet native must have seen that at least have part share in horrible massacre now seemed to that there be nothing to be done save to share lot of spaniard might be believed that mexican must storm palace slaughter within long before return of cortez by mean shared confident anticipation of soldier that general on arrival must very speedily put down insurrection might occur must with assistance of soldier of narvaez soon bring mexico into subjection have happened that juan pedro have also be on guard during massacre be great satisfaction to for felt must no longer have remained in intimate communion with have hand be drenched with innocent blood when upon being relieved at post joined other in chamber shared in common old soldier held up hand said gruffly do hold tongue sancho know what be thinking lad a well a if said maybe disagree with least said soonest mended room without door be not place for man to relieve mind by strong language if happens to differ from superior be bad business shameful one at cholula there be excuse for here there be none be old soldier have taken many life in time never in cold blood like say nothing lad at rate until get chance of being outside city on lake where none can get near then pour out a much a like be like enough roger said that none of will ever go out of city alive will serve thoroughly right if be to be spaniard catholic let be mexican heathen there there be enough juan interrupted now let have supper can eat nothing roger said throwing down on couch where remained in silence until sudden outburst of wild shout cry followed instantly by trumpet calling man to allotted place on wall aroused work of vengeance have begun said gravely a put on thick padded jerkin helmet took up pike only hope may see alvarado author of massacre killed before be juan shook head a roger left room followed with pedro in faith blame have be brought up among people be quite right young soldier said be shameful business have known that be coming here to be butcher must never have taken service under cortez what must have said if on first arrival here when montezuma entertained cortez cavalier people have slain at feast hold tongue young fool juan muttered angrily thing be done can not undo what have to do now be to fight for life even if poor devil have right on side be not matter to stop discus now so keep breath for fighting doubt not that will soon scatter like chaff be by mean case be only intervention of montezuma saved garrison from destruction time until arrival of cortez have passed slowly soldier weakened by hunger thirst muttered angrily against officer who have so rashly brought into strait few of regretted deed for own sake simply because have brought on peril misfortune roger have borne share of fighting on wall be defending life although at first have fought with little ardor pain given by two arrow pierced cotton armor heated blood afterwards fought a stoutly a rest during period of inaction have more than once tried to obtain interview with cacama prisoner be jealously watched one be allowed access to on pretext two officer always accompanied men who took in daily ration be regarded a hostage only le important than montezuma a most of be very rich powerful cazique might offer bribe might well shake fidelity of private soldier when news arrived that cortez with whole of army of narvaez be at hand depression have reigned gave way to exultation soldier believed that must now take offensive without loss of time put end to insurrection marina have accompanied cortez on expedition for be still necessary to a interpreter influence with native be great roger obtained interview with few hour after return have evidently be cry passionately heart be broken roger said have hoped that white men must have done great thing for country know so much although thought there might be trouble at first for great change can never be introduced without trouble never dreamed of anything like cholula be bad enough there people brought on spaniard must have be slain have not first begun to kill here be altogether different be unprovoked massacre after who can hope that white mexican can ever be friendly together love cortez be great generous have be here must have never happened many of people be cruel be greedy of wealth general though be have to give way to remember that in old day at tabasco told how cruelly spaniard have treated people of island when saw first thought that being of different nation have spoken too hardly of see now that be right have along done must for people though be with invader be sure recognize that feel ill will against now fear that will curse a will curse that through time name will be abhorred in mexico again burst into tear think so malinche at tezcuco be always said that stood between native white be owing to that be not more harsh than be a to massacre god forbid must say single word in defense of a white man christian feel be act of horrible atrocity must not make such impression upon people who make war solely to obtain victim whom may sacrifice at altar of god who year slay in cold blood fully twenty five thousand people who have done wrong by side of such horrible slaughter a murder of six hundred other day be drop in ocean of blood annually shed here have be in battle must have be nothing malinche said have offered up at altar of god people must have understood for do be foul act of treachery who after can believe in promise of white know people white despise because have hitherto allowed to be subdued without resistance now that first awe of spaniard have died away have nerved to take up arm will find that be brave see nothing trouble before cortez feel confident that can easily repulse attack subdue city country round think so do malinche men must have fought more bravely than mexican other day be true that be in small number that be now many time stronger have cortez to command on other hand attack be hasty one next time will have whole mexican force upon will do roger must fight for spaniard roger said gloomily be not countryman be white men a be surrounded by foe besides have option mexican can not distinguish between spaniard englishman must be seized sacrificed be to set foot beyond wall be not for must leave city join amenche leave spaniard mexican to fight out quarrel a might now won result must be fatal to if mexican be victorious like other white must be sacrificed to god if spaniard won must be executed a traitor therefore there be nothing for to do to remain with spaniard share fate whatever may be next morning silence reigned over city not mexican be to be seen anywhere near palace within spaniard be virtually prisoner cortez hoped however that cuitlahua must soon persuade people to return to usual habit to open market for provision in case felt so confident of power to overawe city that sent off messenger with dispatch to coast saying that have arrived safely must soon overcome opposition in hour however messenger returned at gallop wounded in score of place reported that city be up in arm drawbridge be raised mexican be marching towards palace scarcely have arrived when sentinel on tower shouted that mass of men be approaching by street leading to palace immediately afterwards terrace flat roof of house near be darkened by throng of native shouting brandishing weapon trumpet instantly sounded to arm so strict be discipline prevailed that in incredibly short time soldier be at post position be capable of being defended against very numerous enemy unprovided with artillery for wall round great one storied building though low be strong turret placed at interval upon enabled defender to command face to pour missile upon who might be bold enough to endeavor to effect breach by undermining with crowbar lever garrison too be sufficient for defense for there be not only twelve hundred spaniard eight thousand tlascalan ally aztec rushed forward with shrill whistle used a battle cry by people of anahuac a advanced poured rain of missile of kind upon palace to be added shot from terrace flat roof spaniard have pierced wall with embrasure for cannon commanded avenue gunner waited until column be close at hand then terrible discharge swept lane through crowded mass in street for moment mexican paused paralyzed by terrible slaughter then rallying rushed forward again three time cannon be discharged into midst though broken disordered still pressed on until swept up to very foot of wall pouring in hail of arrow be well seconded by on housetop who from elevated position be on level with spaniard whose missile arrow javelin stone thrown with great force from sling galled defender greatly wounded great number of in vain did aztec strive to climb wall be of great height a showed head above parapet be shot down by spanish arquebus men struck backwards by weapon of tlascalans failing to scale wall tried to batter down parapet with heavy piece of timber stonework be too strong then shot burning arrow into palace hurled blazing torch over wall palace be of stone of exterior work have be constructed be of wood be soon on fire defender have water with to extinguish flame at point where new work joined wall fire be so fierce that be afraid must spread to palace to extinguish be forced to adopt desperate expedient of overthrowing wall upon burning mass breach thus made be guarded by battery of heavy gun party of arquebusiers repelled attempt of mexican to take advantage of breach have be thus formed fight continued until night fell mexican then drew off cortez follower be astonished at obstinacy with have fought contempt of death have displayed have obtained such easy victory with force fourth of cortez now commanded that have formed lowest opinion of fighting power of aztec now found that nation be not to be trampled upon with impunity however consoled with thought that be temporary outbreak of fury determined to sally out with force on following morning to inflict terrible chastisement upon assailant a soon a morning broke spaniard be under arm cortez be speedily undeceived in hope that slaughter of previous day must have cowed mexican great square street leading to be seen to be crowded with foe who appeared better organized than on previous day being divided into regiment with banner mexican attendant on montezuma told be cognizance of many city of plain showing that whole people be joining in movement commenced by of capital

loincloth having found by experience that cotton armor be absolutely useless against missile of spaniard chief be now conspicuous a moved to fro among dark mass by gay dress metal breastplate worn over bright feather work wore helmet made to resemble head of ferocious wild beast crested with bristly hair surmounted by bright feather plume wore only red fillet round head having tuft of cotton hanging from tuft denoting victory in have taken part own rank in army noble citizen priest soldier have united in common cause assault be about to commence when spaniard artillery musketry poured death into crowded rank gate be at once thrown open cortez at head of cavalry dashed out followed by infantry tlascalan ally confused by slaughter made by firearm aztec must offer resistance to onslaught cavalry trampled underfoot mowed down with sword lance spanish foot tlascalans following close behind carried on work of destruction seemed to spaniard that fight be already over when aztec fled before movement of retreat however ceased moment mexican reached barricade have thrown up across street forming behind made gallant stand while upon housetop poured shower of arrow dart great stone down upon advancing spaniard in vain spanish artillery be brought up fire swept away barricade there be still others behind at desperate fight be renewed coming down from side street aztec fell upon spanish flank cloud of missile be shot from boat crowded canal everywhere intersecting street cortez cavalier continued to make desperate charge through aztec who although unable to withstand weight impetus of horse closed round striving to throw rider from back to stab horse throwing away life without hesitation on chance of getting one blow at spaniard moment horseman drew back aztec followed although loss be immense rank be instantly filled up again while spaniard must ill spare comparatively small number who fell on side at last after hour of carnage spaniard exhausted by exertion having eaten nothing since night before fell back to palace diaz one of historian of event who be present at combat expressed astonishment felt by spaniard at desperation with despised mexican have fought mexican said fought with such ferocity that if have have assistance of ten thousand hector a many orlando must have made impression on there be several of troop who have served in italian war there in battle with turk have ever seen anything like desperation shown by indian a spaniard fell back aztec followed pouring in volley of stone arrow a soon a have entered palace

evidently well satisfied with event of day looked for victory on morrow cortez have received severe wound in hand during fight companion felt how grievously have mistaken character of aztec have sallied out that morning confident in power to crush out insurrection returned feeling that situation be well nigh desperate henceforth must fight not for dominion for life a soon a day broke fight be renewed time be aztec not spaniard who began there be idea of fresh sortie that garrison must hope be to defend position so furiously did native attack that for time forced way into entrenchment spaniard whose turn be to fight with bravery of despair fell upon with such fury that none of who have gained entry returned cortez now sent to montezuma to request to interpose a have done before between people emperor refused to interfere have viewed desperate fighting of last two day with bitter humiliation have seen brother cuitlahua leading on troop with greatest gallantry while thanks to own conduct be helpless prisoner mourned over terrible loss people be suffering fact that kindness to spaniard have brought upon nothing ill treatment insult at hand have earned contempt of people have involved country in misfortune ruin cut to heart have to do with malinzin said coldly desire only to die when still further urged added be useless will believe false word promise of malinzin will never leave wall alive on being assured that spaniard must willingly depart leave country if assailant must open way to at last consented to address people clothing in richest robe of state ascended central turret of palace surrounded by guard of spaniard accompanied by several aztec noble when be seen din of war ceased a if by magic dead silence fell upon multitude knelt prostrated before sovereign have so long held in deepest reverence when addressed assuring that be guest not prisoner of spaniard ordered to lay down arm to allow spaniard to march to coast indignation at cowardice

aside to enable better to be seen before must close around cover with shield three missile struck one stone hurled from sling smiting on head with such violence that fell insensible when aztec saw fall brief outburst of indignation be succeeded by one of sorrow with cry of grief whole multitude dispersed in minute two crowded square be wholly deserted montezuma be carried to chamber when recovered sensibility refused absolutely to allow wound to be dressed tore off bandage not word passed lip sat in attitude of deepest dejection own people despised have raised hand against have drunk deeply of cup of humiliation at hand of spaniard last drop filled to overflowing there be nothing for to die spanish leader tried in vain to persuade to submit to surgical treatment paid attention to

of pyramid be absolutely necessary for safety of defender to dislodge from position cortez ordered chamberlain don escobar with hundred men to storm teocalli set fire to sanctuary little force be three time repulsed forced to fall back with considerable loss cortez then though suffering much from wound in left hand determined to lead assault a be incapable of holding shield have strapped to left arm with three hundred picked men thousand of tlascalans sallied out from palace attacked aztec in temple at foot of pyramid spaniard made way through without much difficulty then commenced ascent of pyramid offered great facility for defense there be five terrace connected by step so placed that mounting pyramid have to make whole circuit on terrace before reaching step leading to next be thus necessary to pas round pyramid four time nearly two mile exposed to missile of upon summit leaving strong body of spaniard tlascalans at bottom to prevent native ascending attacking in rear cortez led way up staircase followed closely by principal officer in spite of heavy stone beam of wood with storm of arrow be hurled down upon spaniard won way from terrace to terrace supported by fire of musketeer below until at last reached great platform on summit of pyramid here terrible conflict commenced aztec brought to bay fighting not only for life in presence of country god displayed valor at least equal to of spaniard number be slightly in favor be far more than counter balanced by superior arm of spaniard by armor rendered almost invulnerable to comparatively puny weapon of mexican yet for three hour fight continued at end of time mexican save two three priest be killed while forty five of spaniard have fallen almost others be wounded while fight have be raging combat have ceased elsewhere combatant on side being absorbed in struggle taking place at summit of temple must not of course judge how be going though caught sight of combatant a neared edge of platform be unprotected by wall fence many in course of struggle fell be hurled over moment struggle be over spaniard rushed with exulting shout into sanctuary of mexican god reeking with blood of fresh killed victim cast image from pedestal rolled across platform to head of step then amid shout be echoed by comrade below sent bounding down while cry of anguish dismay rose from mexican image dethroned fire be applied to sanctuary smoke flame rising up must have told countless thousand watching capital from housetop of neighboring city that white men have triumphed over god of mexico that a at cholula so at capital have proved impotent to protect votary from dread invader so dismayed be mexican at misfortune that offered resistance to return of spaniard from temple retired to house without further fighting at night spaniard sallied out again relying upon habit of mexican to abstain from fighting at night burnt several hundred house believing that spirit of mexican must be broken now cortez on following morning mounted turret from montezuma have addressed malinche be by side when held up hand to show that wished to address silence fell upon multitude malinche voice be heard plainly by a translated word of cortez told must now feel that must not struggle against spaniard god have be cast down dwelling burnt warrior slaughtered have brought on by rebellion yet if must lay down arm return to obedience of sovereign must stay hand if not must make city heap of ruin leave not soul alive to mourn over cortez learned at once that spirit have roused in mexican be in way lowered by revers one of great chief answered that be true have hurled down god massacred countryman be content to lose thousand life for one took street said be still thronged with warrior number be scarcely diminished yours be lessening day be dying with hunger sickness provision water be failing must soon fall into hand bridge be broken down can not escape there will be too few of left to satisfy vengeance of god when have finished shower of arrow showed that hostility have recommenced garrison be now completely disheartened of what use tremendous exertion have made life have be lost be still a have be on first day of arrival hemmed in in fortress surrounded by foe thirsting for blood great number be wounded more le severely provision be well nigh gone enemy be bolder than ever have be promised wealth honor be starving death stared in face loudly exclaimed that have be deceived betrayed men who have served all along with cortez stood firm have still confidence in leader be not fault that have be brought to pas by misconduct of others during absence at rate a pointed out to comrade only chance of escape be unity obedience cortez be a always in moment of great danger calm collected thought of having to leave city to abandon treasure have taken be even more painful to than to soldier be not loss of own share of booty of of emperor that regretted for felt that together with downfall of plan loss of kingdom have already counted won must bring upon displeasure of emperor must give strength to enemy at court must probably ensure being recalled in disgrace nevertheless saw that retreat be necessary for position must not be maintained day defense became weaker men more exhausted by fighting there must soon be no longer morsel of bread to serve out to retreat must therefore be made question be route must be chosen in case one of narrow dike connecting island city with shore must be traversed on causeway spaniard must fight under great disadvantage finally settled upon that leading to tlacopan be much shortest being only two mile in length for day large party of men have be at work constructing movable tower similar to used century before in siege moved on roller be to be dragged by tlascalan ally from summit soldier must shoot down upon housetop from have be hitherto so annoyed tower be also provided with bridge must be let down on to roof so enable soldier to meet opponent hand to hand when structure be completed spaniard again took offensive gate be opened three tower dragged by tlascalans moved out mexican astonished at sight of machine from whose summit heavy fire of musketry be kept up fell back for time tower be moved up close to terrace soldier after partly clearing by fire lowered light bridge crossing engaged in hand to hand fight with mexican drove from position from lofty house of noble mexican still maintained resistance tower be not high enough to overlook a came up beam of wood huge stone be cast down upon striking with such force that soon became evident to within that tower must not hold together be dragged on however until canal crossed road bridge have be removed cavalry tower be brought to standstill latter be abandoned cortez ordered troop to make road forward by filling up canal with stone wood from house near while engaged in operation be exposed to incessant fire from point of advantage in neighborhood from opposite bank of canal work be however completed cavalry crossing drove mexican headlong down great street until came to canal where same work have again to be performed le than seven canal crossed street took two day of constant fighting before last of be crossed whole street in hand just a last canal have be captured cortez who be ever at head of men received news that mexican desired to open parley with that of noble have arrived at palace for purpose delighted at news rode back with officer mexican requested that two priest who have be captured in great temple must be released must be bearer of term discus negotiation cortez at once consented priest left with envoy with instruction if mexican must lay down arm past must be forgiven mission be however mere trick mexican be most anxious to rescue priest one of whom be high priest therefore most sacred in eye cortez have scarcely sat down to meal sorely needed after fatigue when news be brought that mexican have again attacked with greater fury than ever at three point have driven off detachment placed to guard newly made causeway across canal cortez companion leaped on horse riding down great street again cleared sooner have reached other end than mexican gathering in lane side street poured in again overpowered guard at one of principal canal swarm of warrior poured in on side storm of arrow other missile be poured down upon cortez cavalier confusion at broken bridge be tremendous cavalry infantry struggled fiercely with crowd of foe while others strove again to repair bridge mexican have again torn down cortez performed prodigy of valor in covering retreat of men dashing alone into midst of rank of enemy shouting battle cry dealing death with blow of sword so far did penetrate among foe that report spread that be killed when at last fought way back leaped horse over chasm still remaining in bridge escape be regarded by troop a absolutely miraculous be said that have be saved by national apostle saint james virgin mary who have fought by side at night mexican a usual drew off spaniard dispirited exhausted fell back to citadel that evening montezuma died have refused all nourishment a well a medicine from time have be wounded father olmedo did best to persuade to embrace christian faith montezuma stoutly refused just before died sent for cortez recommended three daughter by principal wife to charge begging to interest master emperor on behalf to see that have portion of rightful inheritance lord will do said if only for friendly office have rendered spaniard for love have shown though have brought to condition for bear ill will cortez promised after conquest took three lady into own family be instructed in doctrine of christianity be married to spanish noble handsome dowry assigned to news of montezuma death be received with real grief by spaniard to whom generosity constant kindness gentleness of manner have endeared there can be little doubt that in spite of accusation against of meditating treachery montezuma be from time entered capital sincere in goodwill towards spaniard be devoted to own god believed implicitly in prophecy quetzalcoatl descendant must return to rule mexico superior science attainment confirmed in belief that spaniard fulfilled prophecy be willing to resign alike power possession to hand in early day have shown great personal bravery cowardice displayed throughout whole of dealing with spaniard be result of superstition not that of personal fear cortez paid respect to remains of late unhappy captive body be arrayed in royal robe laid on bier be carried by noble who have remained faithful to during imprisonment into city be uncertain where montezuma be finally buried with death of emperor last hope of spaniard of making term with assailant vanished there be nothing now retreat after debate be settled that must take place at night when must find mexican unprepared difficulty of passage must be greater must be thought be counterbalanced by advantage of being able to make at least portion of retreat unobserved be determined that time must be lost mexican must doubtless be mourning over body of montezuma must be unprepared for such prompt action on part of spaniard first question be disposal of treasure soldier have for most part converted share of gold into chain wore round neck there be vast amount in bar ornament constituting one fifth have be set aside for crown one fifth for cortez share of principal officer one of strongest horse be laden with richest portion of crown treasure rest be abandoned gold lay in great heap take what like of cortez said to men be careful not to overload yourselves travel safest in dark who travel lightest ' own veteran took advice contented with picking out few of most valuable ornament soldier of narvaez must not bring to leave such treasure behind loaded up with a much gold a must carry cortez now arranged order of march van be composed of two hundred spanish foot twenty horseman under order of gonzalo de sandoval rearguard with main body of infantry greater portion of gun be commanded by alvarado velasquez de leon cortez led center be in charge of baggage of heavy gun prisoner among whom be son two daughter of montezuma cacama other noble who have be in prison with tlascalans be divided among three corp portable bridge have be prepared for crossing canal intersected causeway intention being that must be laid across canal that army must pas over that must then be carried forward to next gap in causeway be most faulty arrangement necessitating frequent long delay entailing almost certain disaster have three such portable bridge be constructed column must have crossed causeway with comparatively little risk there be reason why bridge must not have be constructed a must have be carried without difficulty by tlascalans at midnight troop be in readiness for march mass be performed by father olmedo at one o'clock on july st spaniard sallied out from fortress that have so stoutly defended silence reigned in city a noiselessly a possible troop made way down broad street expecting moment to be attacked even tramping of horse rumbling of baggage wagon artillery did not awake sleeping mexican head of column arrived at head of causeway before be discovered then a advanced guard be preparing to lay portable bridge across first opening aztec sentinel gave alarm priest on summit of temple heard cry at once sounded horn huge war drum instantly city awoke silence be succeeded by roar of sound vanguard have scarcely got upon causeway when canoe shot out upon lake soon storm of stone arrow burst upon column more more terrible did become a fresh canoe crowded with warrior came up many of pushed up to causeway native landing fell upon spaniard with fury latter made stay fighting way through foe pressed on until reached next opening in causeway there waited for bridge to come up column many thousand strong with baggage artillery take long time to cross bridge advanced guard have reached opening long before rear have passed bridge there stood helpless exposed to terrible storm of missile until at last column be across bridge then forty picked men who have be specially told off for task tried to raise so that might be carried to front weight of baggage wagon artillery have so wedged into earth that be unable to move persevered in effort until most of have fallen rest bore terrible news to army that bridge be immovable terrible cry of despair arose a news spread hope seemed lost regardless of order discipline pressed forward to endeavor in way other to cross obstacle barred way pressed on by behind sandoval cavalier dashed into water distance be short horse be weak from hunger burdened by own heavy armor that of rider succeeded in swimming across others sank while reached opposite side only to fall back again a tried to climb steep bank infantry followed throwing away armor to enable to swim succeeded others be pressed down by comrade many be killed by war club spear of mexican in canoe others again half stunned by club be dragged into canoe carried off to city to be sacrificed along causeway fight raged unceasingly aztec in boat alongside leaping ashore grappling with foe rolling with down causeway into water while in distance kept up rain of missile opening in causeway be at last filled choked up with ammunition wagon gun bale of rich good chest of gold body of men horse over spaniard made way cortez have swum waded across on horse rode on until joined sandoval remains of advanced guard who be checked at third last opening cavalier set example to follower by plunging into water rest followed a best must many be drowned by weight of gold carried others got across by clinging to tail mane of horse cortez with sandoval other cavalier led retreat until reached end of causeway din of battle be now far behind who came up brought news that rear guard be so sorely pressed that must be destroyed unless aid reached cortez companion did not hesitate dashed along causeway again swam canal made way through crowd until reached rear guard morning be breaking now showed lake covered with canoe filled with warrior along whole length of causeway desperate fight be raging cortez found alvarado on foot horse have be killed under with handful of follower be still desperately defending rear against mexican who have poured out from city in pursuit artillery have at first done good service sweeping causeway mowing down hundred of assailant aztec be careless of life rushed on so furiously that swept over gun killing who served fell upon infantry charge of cortez companion for moment bore back foe pressed by behind swept aside resistance bore back spaniard to edge of canal cortez companion plunged in swam across alvarado stood on brink hesitating unhorsed defenseless must not make way across gap be now crowded with canoe of enemy set strong lance on bottom of canal using a leaping pole sprang across feat be extraordinary one for although width be not given be declared by who witnessed to be impossible for mortal filled friend foe alike with astonishment spot be to day known by mexican a alvarado aztec followed farther be occupied now in securing enormous wealth spaniard have left behind remnant of army marched along causeway unmolested took possession of village at end cortez iron hearted a be sat down burst into tear a viewed broken remnant of army be consoled however by finding that many of most trusted companion have escaped sandoval alvarado olid ordaz avila be safe so to great joy be marina have with daughter of tlascalan chief be placed under escort of party of tlascalan warrior in van of column have passed unharmed through danger of night loss of spaniard in retreat be variously estimated balance of authority among contemporary writer place at four hundred fifty spaniard four thousand tlascalans with loss sustained in previous conflict reduced spaniard to about third tlascalans to fifth of force have entered capital greater part of soldier of narvaez have be killed have formed rear guard have not only borne brunt of battle have suffered from effect of cupidity of cavalry twenty three remained mounted artillery have be lost musket thrown away in flight velasquez de leon have fallen in early part of retreat bravely defending rear several others among leader have also fallen together with prisoner whom have brought out from capital remains of army straggled on into town of tlacopan cortez must allow of halt there at moment exultant aztec from capital might arrive in battle in street spaniard must stand chance whatever with foe therefore hurried soldier through when outside endeavored to form into sort of order be necessary to give few hour of repose led towards eminence crowned by temple commanded plain be held by party of native troop dispirited exhausted refused at first to advance against influence of cortez backed by example of officer have usual effect column moved forward against temple native after few discharge of missile abandoned place be large building affording ample shelter for spaniard ally provision be found there large supply of fuel intended for service of temple here lighting great fire dried clothing bound up wound after partaking of food threw down to sleep fortunate be for spaniard that mexican contented with slaughter have inflicted plunder have captured most of with prisoner whom have carried off to be sacrificed on altar retired to capital allowed invader twenty four hour breathing time have pressed hotly relentlessly from moment when emerged from causeway must have annihilated for at time spaniard be too worn out dispirited to be capable of effectual resistance food rest however did wonder for be hardy veteran with cortez leader most trusted with soon came to look at matter in more cheerful light be still stronger than be when first marched upon mexico why then must despair of making way back to tlascala where must have rest friend knew there be long painful march before probably desperate battle to fight in fair field felt match for number of enemy when late in evening officer bade form up prepare for night march fell in steadily willingly cortez felt that must again be relied upon under emergency chapter passage of causeway on marching out from city roger two comrade formed part of picked band to whom be entrusted charge of prisoner roger have be specially selected a must translate to order given by officer of party be ordered to march next to have once twice in past few day be enabled by intervention of marina to visit prisoner cacama spirit be in way shaken by captivity general have made fatal mistake said in sending cuitlahua out to pacify populace be of very different stuff from montezuma who have become woman in hand of spanish will see that will never return will lead people on to attack matter little to know that will never escape spaniard will slay rather than that must rejoin people for care not one must rather die in battle than be slain a captive in case will be dying for country what can wish for more be duty of to risk life whenever be needed for country here have fought in fifty battle for mexico be younger not too young to have shared in many battle fear death in way friend must welcome a change from captivity be well content now must have grieved to have died believing that mexican have lost ancient spirit courage be content to be slave beneath yoke of handful of stranger now see that be asleep not dead that boasting stranger will find that despised mexican be match for will die happy news of wounding of montezuma desperate fighting in street round palace excited prisoner to utmost in place of confinement heard thunder of gun perpetual rattle of musketry shout yell of combatant be only when roger visited that obtained detail a to combat be going on be filled with enthusiasm a heard how desperately countryman be fighting only regret be that must not join in struggle die leading assault against spaniard roger did not see upon last day until took place by side when column formed up in courtyard be to keep near cacama said in order to translate anything officer may have to say to be going to leave city cacama asked eagerly yes be going to cross causeway officer in charge here came up gave order roger interpreted asks whether will all give pledge to remain silent a march out if will do so will accept promise if not will be forced to gag a safety of army depends upon getting beyond street before march be discovered wonder that be ready to take promise cacama said disdainfully after own treachery however aztec noble be not like spaniard faith may be depended upon will give word to be silent other prisoner also promised be allowed to take place in column ungagged alarm be given long before rear of column have got out from street cacama gave exclamation of joy when heard silence broken by loud cry at end of street immediately afterwards by shout of priest on lofty temple by blowing of horn beating of great war drum game have begun said will see how many spaniard remain alive when sun rise long before can get across causeway people will be upon will not see triumph for without defensive armor will fall in darkness beneath missile of own people that matter not better to die at hand of mexican struggling to be free than at of treacherous invader missile showered down thickly upon column from house till emerged from street made way out on to causeway then became exposed to storm of arrow dart stone from canoe on lake by officer order soldier immediately in charge of prisoner drew sword formed circle round with order to fall upon kill at once did make slightest movement to escape roger translated to captive officer assurance that although be most anxious for safety have resource to order soldier to slay at once if made movement to escape will not try to escape cacama said how can do so with hand bound during long pause ensued before rear of column passed over bridge on to causeway impatience among soldier be great many have already fallen beneath missile of enemy scarce one have received wound more le severe several of prisoner too have fallen what be cacama asked a cry of despair went up when became known that bridge be immovable that there be mean of crossing break in causeway ahead muttered exclamation of triumph when roger repeated to news have just learned that settle said fate be now sealed god be at last fighting again for mexico roger be sorry for be sorry for wife for amenche rejoice for country if must escape night roger have more chance than most since speak language do can for may be sure that will do cacama chance of escaping seems to small one still may be that will get over alive spaniard have fault cacama be grand soldier at rate now that see must win way perish will perform wonder ah exclamation be caused by arrow striking young prince in chest at time terrible fight be raging around native have gained footing on causeway spaniard be fighting hand to hand with be mortally wounded roger cacama said most of others have already fallen be better so have lived long enough to see vengeance taken on oppressor roger there be one chance for wrap round one of mantle in darkness none will see that be not mexican will not shoot at listen there be cuitcatl war cry know voice doubtless have discerned white dress in darkness be trying to rescue crowd pressing along causeway have swept guard away from prisoner indeed there be now scarcely prisoner left to guard unprotected by defensive armor most of have fallen very early in conflict roger be supporting cacama prisoner lay dead at foot roger stooped snatched off mantle then lifting cacama in arm forced way through press to edge of causeway just a canoe ran up alongside number of aztec sprang ashore cuitcatl roger shouted at top of voice here young noble exclaimed a sprang forward here be cacama roger cried at same moment received stunning blow on back of helmet from one of spaniard who took for mexican fell down side of causeway into water with burden in arm when roger recovered sens be lying in canoe be being paddled rapidly have be insensible few minute for cry of combatant still sounded close at hand cuitcatl be bending over how be cacama asked a soon a must speak ala be dead cuitcatl replied did best to save roger spoke once after have got into canoe said 'protect wife cuitcatl save friend ' where be taking roger asked next will land distance up lake there will obtain bearer carry cacama home that may be buried a one of rank must be a to must think what have best be done none of with know who be believing in darkness that be one of be own men can rely upon when blood be cooled be best that at present remained in ignorance bathalda be in bow influence mine will be sufficient to control when be once out of hearing of conflict nothing save duty to cacama must have withdrawn from must do without not spaniard will see tomorrow sun be badly hurt roger be too dark to see anything not badly have several arrow point sticking in in one place have not gone deep armor kept out be blow on head felled there be many mexican on causeway fighting with spaniard be of course mistaken for one of helmet broke blow be stunned rather than injured think how came to be just at spot be on lookout for prisoner being determined to rescue cacama if possible a be fighting farther back heard said that there be several white dress among spaniard ahead so made to point just a be springing ashore heard shout saw roll down guessed might be cacama for knew that must do best to save so sprang back again to water edge found that be so found ala that cacama be mortally wounded how about other prisoner think that have fallen before did see have protection even who have armor be suffering terribly from missile poured in among know that two lady montezuma daughter be among first to fall more than can not say for kept close to cacama hoping that in way might find opportunity to aid escape have not be struck just when be might have done so for after news came that bridge must not be removed be confusion man thought only of saving own life after rowing for three hour canoe having made circuit of city crossed lake reached shore at distance of few mile from tezcuco cacama body be lifted ashore then cuitcatl said to bathalda bathalda will be glad to know that have saved cacama friend mine roger hawkshaw forester gave exclamation of pleasure be glad indeed exclaimed wondered what have become of in fight bathalda exclamation silenced murmur with others have heard that one of white men have be saved by from general destruction a believed have fallen upon oppressor be friend of people cuitcatl went on be of race to spaniard a see men speaks language well be like one of cacama held a dear friend a know cacama hated spaniard have not be for treason must have attacked long ago now form litter with paddle lay cacama upon morning be breaking have far to go new lord of tezcuco be friend of spaniard must get well away a soon a can roger threw aside spanish helmet cuitcatl took of plume from own headdress bound round head a soon a bier be constructed little party started in afternoon arrived at cuitcatl house chief having gone forward to inform queen of cacama fate of near approach of party with body be mournful scene when arrived whole of male female retainer be assembled outside house woman filling air with cry lamentation men weeping wailing bearer of bier passed into house where maclutha awaited roger unwilling to intrude upon grief of unhappy queen remained without talking to bathalda native viewing with hostility wonder being unable to understand how be that lord have brought one of white men to house in minute two however amenche attendant ran down step to roger telling to follow led way to apartment where princess be waiting fell cry into arm be terrible roger sobbed a long a brother be captive have hoped that might be restored to now be brought home dead slain too by mexican arrow cacama be ready for death amenche be beside from time left prison be sure that must be attacked saw that a with be unprotected by armor must be first to fall when fighting began a in darkness mexican must not be able to distinguish from enemy said that be quite content to die seeing that people have now recovered ancient spirit be battling with hero against oppressor be destroyed amenche exclaimed passionately know that roger replied position be terrible one seemed well nigh hopeless know that cuitcatl regarded a quite hopeless deems that have fallen think so passage to be crossed be of great width though number may have fallen believe that will have made way across will have lost gun if aztec continue to press a hotly a did upon causeway may slay if give time to rally may yet fight way back to tlascala will stop here with roger be not so if people will allow to do so will amenche ask for nothing better remember that even cacama felt doubtful whether must protect from power of priest at time reason for hating spaniard be small to what now be cacama have gone cuitcatl though powerful cazique have small influence in comparison with cacama a king of tezcuco nephew of montezuma possessed how be montezuma have become of heard that be wounded scarce seems possible that own subject must raise hand against died yesterday afternoon cortez delivered body to people of city girl uttered exclamation of horror be dreadful indeed said bursting again into tear to think of great emperor being dead what horror misfortune have befallen be bad for too roger be one of favorite niece thought of going to obtaining permission to marry in order that must be received into nation now that hope be gone must leave for while go to maclutha must not leave longer alone in grief soon afterwards cuitcatl entered room come roger said meal have be prepared sorely need food rest tomorrow will have time to talk over future by time will have news whether of spaniard have escaped if have must hurry off again for cuitlahua have sworn that not one will leave country alive man who can bear arm must take field against will be easy task for at rate few can have got off causeway alive roger be glad a soon a have finished meal to throw down on couch have be on guard greater part of night before sortie to clear street leading to causeway have slept hour two following evening have lost good deal of blood from blow have received on head from arrow wound of have several although none be serious be now completely done up amenche stole away from maclutha for few minute talk with cuitcatl while have meal after hearing outline of later event of siege of palace of fight on causeway have insisted that roger must instantly seek repose will be occupied with maclutha there be much to see about in such time a there can be pomp ceremonial of burial must come when peace be restored carry be ash to be laid with father at tezcuco bathalda of slave have already started to bring in wood for funeral pile will be ready by sunrise tomorrow roger wound be dressed by one of slave who be skilled in operation connected with wound slept without once waking until cuitcatl came to in morning bade arise a be ready for ceremony of cacama cremation rule in mexico be that on death of anyone body be attired in garment peculiar to tutelary deity cacama be dressed simply in robe indicating rank see amenche said when roger joined have dressed in warrior robe not in of lord of tezcuco for have none such here have attired in garment of god for cacama a know worshiped chiefly great unknown god in whom grandfather believed who be lord of god of people who must be same roger that white people worship doubt be same roger said be glad amenche that brother have already come to love be not lord of god for be only god there be none others day dear when come to england with priest will instruct in know of see be going to light pile what be piece of paper that cover body be charm roger against danger of unknown road have to travel be custom of country did not think while to depart from be also custom to sacrifice number of slave send to be attendant upon road unknown god hate sacrifice of blood cacama although forced to yield to power of priest must have have none must have helped in tezcuco cuitcatl a oldest friend of dead prince applied torch to pile be composed for most part of aromatic wood maclutha amenche broke into plaintive hymn in attendant female who have collected in considerable number from neighboring village joined higher higher rose flame voice rising with until dirge culminated in loud wailing cry a flame reached corpse hid from view then hymn recommenced continued until pile have be burnt down mourner then re entered house leaving two three priest who be present to collect ash to place in large gold vase of must act a guardian until time came for removal in solemn procession to tezcuco cuitcatl took roger aside have bad news from mexico said be right be mistaken portion of spaniard tlascalans succeeded in crossing breach in causeway gaining mainland however be said that two third of number perished a have lost terrible weapon committed such destruction will be at mercy know now that be not invincible terror have departed be assured that will not escape have reached land on opposite side of lake will have to make great circuit will give time to collect force cuitlahua have already dispatched messenger to town village ordering to assemble under chief to be prepared to march at moment notice when rendezvous be settled upon must have be finished on causeway there can be no doubt a to result at most there be four hundred white four thousand tlascalans while will number over one hundred thousand say white men have lost not only great gun carry on shoulder that only twenty thirty of strange animal have survived therefore time will fight with something like equal arm will overwhelm a sea overwhelms rock simile be unfortunate one cuitcatl sea cover rock when retires rock remains still doe seem to that however valiantly spaniard may fight can not withstand such terrible odds can not rejoice with know abhor a much a do cruel massacre at temple sympathy be with people while struggling to throw off yoke that spaniard have imposed upon be white like know that many among be noble men that much of harm have committed have be done from conscientious motif just a people have from desire to please god offered up thousand of human victim year much a love gold many of certainly cortez among think more of spreading religion than do of personal ambition even of gain have many acquaintance good friend among can not think of being destroyed without regret horror say that be not justified in killing for existence a nation be at stake to be terrible can understand that friend nothing can avert destruction now a to have not be for cacama death must have said be best that must marry amenche at once among must be most unseemly for sister to think of marrying when brother have just died be same with roger said certain time must always pas after death of near relative before marriage besides present be time for thinking of thing fate be altogether uncertain own consider there be small ground for hope can escape from present trouble if a seems certain now spaniard be destroyed people will more than ever venerate god power of priest will be almost unlimited be useless for to try to deceive cuitcatl know friendship must not have power to withstand decision of priest will never permit single white man to remain alive in land have cacama lived might possibly have protected think that even authority must have be insufficient to do so if spaniard be destroyed have one chance of life be to make way down to coast to sail away with spaniard there cuitcatl be silent for felt force of what roger said if go must not go alone replied at last amenche must die be to desert will assuredly take if will accompany roger said think that there be much chance of escape even in way news of destruction of spaniard will be carried with speed of wind down to coast tribe there will instantly rise fall upon spaniard who have be most friendly with will be very first to take up arm against in order to make peace with aztec to avert vengeance for aid have given spaniard long before must reach coast spaniard there must either be killed driven on board ship cuitcatl must not deny justice of roger reasoning there be nothing to do latter went on to wait at rate until battle have taken place impossible a seems spaniard may yet extricate from toil in case must join if not find escape by coast cut off by rising of tribe there only thing can see be to take to mountain to live there a did with bathalda on proceeds of chase might then perhaps in time make way to people in far north who have not such reason a have here for hating man with white skin might wait until spaniard send expedition to carry out what cortez have failed to accomplish leaving fire burning remains of spanish army marched at midnight from temple where have enjoyed rest have recruited strength spirit sick wounded be placed in center carried on litter on back of porter while others who be strong enough to sit upright rode on horse behind mounted soldier night march continued without disturbance in morning large party of native be seen moving about tlacopan lay on most westerly point of lake most direct route of spaniard must have be to keep along by margin have done so must have be liable to attack from capital a troop must have poured out across causeway to tepejacac headed there therefore struck off due north with intention of passing to west of lake xaltocan country be broken one mexican gathering on hill rolled stone down upon with volley of arrow dart sometimes even ventured to descend into plain fall upon rear of column a often a did so however little body of cavalry drove off infantry column kept steadily on way though greatly harassed by continued attack day after day passed in manner spaniard being reduced to great strait from want of food a native in small town village through passed carried off provision store only food soldier must obtain be wild cherry few ear of corn have be left by harvester sometimes horse fell dead from exhaustion afforded welcome supply of food many of soldier dropped lifeless from fatigue famine others unable to keep up march fell behind be captured by enemy carried off to furnish sacrifice for god to lighten soldier threw away gold to obtain have dared so many danger suffered so many hardship life be at stake precious metal have ceased to have value in eye through terrible day cortez a usual set splendid example to solder be in front wherever danger threatened bore full share of hardship by cheerfulness calmness kept up spirit of soldier cheered by assuring might yet escape from

level house a fast a spaniard won way along street did until reached first canal bridge here have be broken down after indian have crossed temporary plank be pulled after joined countryman behind solid rampart of stone erected on other side of canal be not until after two hour hard fighting use of artillery that obstacle be cleared away spaniard wading across canal pressed forward without further resistance until reached great square on one side of stood palace have so long occupied aztec disheartened at manner in defense on relied have be captured by spaniard by presence in heart of city for time desisted from effort be roused to fury a body of spaniard rushed up winding terrace to summit of great temple hurled priest from summit then with yell of fury threw upon enemy headlong

for seeing speedy manner in have overcome defense erected by mexican many of city have hitherto stood aloof now sent in submission supplied levy to assist in work while ixtlilxochitl who have now become lord of tezcuco be strong adherent of spaniard brought up force of fifty thousand tezcucans who be divided among three army simultaneous attack be now made advance along causeway being a before covered by ship enemy fought stoutly hour elapsed before spaniard again entered city advance be now more easy than on previous occasion owing to destruction of building bordering street native however still fought with greatest obstinacy great square be at last reached thinking to discourage native by destruction of of principal edifice cortez ordered palace have served a former barrack to be set on fire a also house of bird adjoining montezuma palace be soon mass of flame aztec however be infuriated rather than intimidated fight raged with greater fury than ever having accomplished object cortez again gave order to fall back covered by cavalry retired down street so desperately assailed by native few men reached fort unwounded day after day same tactic be repeated mexican night repairing breach cleared out day by spanish ally cortez found impossible to guard causeway prevent soldier being already overcome by fatigue of daily encounter alvarado division however held at night ground won in daytime troop suffered dreadfully from incessant toil from rain poured down in torrent soldier of cortez fared little better for building in fort of xoloc afforded shelter to few rest have to sleep on causeway in rear exposed to tempestuous weather frequently too be called up to battle for aztec emperor contrary to usual practice of countryman frequently attacked by night often making simultaneous attack on three division on causeway while at same moment troop from neighboring town attacked camp in rear did not content with open attack resorted to stratagem on one occasion have large number of canoe in ambuscade among tall reed bordering lake several large boat then rowed near spanish vessel believing that be filled with provision intended for city two of smaller vessel pursued aztec boat made for reed spaniard followed presently struck upon submerged timber indian have driven in be instantly attacked by whole fleet of canoe most of men be wounded several including two captain slain one of spanish craft captured be now three month since siege have begun attitude of mexican be a bold defiant a ever several attempt cortez have made to open negotiation with young emperor have be received with scorn be certain that sooner later famine must do work for approach to city be in hand of spaniard a town of lake be either friendly overawed by great army of ally even canoe at first made way in at night with provision have ceased to steal across in darkness great native levy be of little use to spaniard in absolute fighting did good service by overawing town making expedition against tribe have not yet consented to throw in lot with invader by sweeping in provision from wide extent of country to wait until famine did work little suited spirit of spaniard process must assuredly be long one for men who fought so stoutly must resist starvation with equal tenacity besides duration of siege be already beginning to excite discontent among ally whose war be generally of very short duration spaniard too be suffering from severe illness brought on by fatigue exposure hardship be now determined to make grand effort to obtain possession of great market of tlatelolco lay on northwestern part of city possession must enable force of cortez to join hand with of alvarado sandoval spacious market with hall portico must furnish accommodation for army enable to attack city at close quarter instead of having to fight way day along causeway sandoval be to join alvarado sending seventy picked troop to support cortez advancing along causeway supported not only by ship by countless host of canoe filled with ally of lake city who penetrated canal caused confusion in rear of aztec division of cortez cleared suburb of opponent then advanced towards square of tlatelolco by three great street alderete commanded force advanced by main central avenue be raised causeway with canal running on side of road tapia brother of alvarado commanded one of other

simultaneously spanish pressed aztec back before ally filled up canal a took one by one tlascalans stormed house attacked enemy on roof while canoe engaged of aztec so prevented from interfering with men occupied in filling up breach parallel street be near enough to other for spaniard to hear shout of companion in other column to know that be gaining ground steadily enemy in street fought with le obstinacy than usual cortez with usual keen sightedness at once apprehended that feebleness of resistance indicated device that aztec be allowing to advance only to lead into trap have received message from alderete saying that be getting on fast that be short distance from great square fearing that officer eager to be first to gain marketplace be not taking proper precaution to secure retreat cortez with small body of troop retraced step turned up street by alderete column have advanced have gone short distance when saw that stringent order have be neglected for came upon opening thirty foot wide full of water at least twelve foot deep slight attempt only have be made to stop gap stone timber lying by side showed that have be abandoned a soon a commenced general saw too that road have be narrowed a approached point that work have evidently be recently done much alarmed at consequence of neglect at once set men to fill up breach have scarcely begun operation when terrific yell arose drowning mingled clamor of distant conflict alderete have a cortez supposed pressed on retreating aztec with too great eagerness have carried barricade defended breach have given order that chasm must be filled up in eagerness to be first in square spaniard have pressed on none caring to stop to see that ally carried out order so taking position after position pressed on until be close

dead while in lay men woman child in last stage of famine yet weakened suffering a be aztec maintained resolution rejecting overture of cortez at last division of alvarado cleared way into great square party mounting great temple where so many of comrade have be massacred defeated aztec who guarded position slaughtered priest set fire to sanctuary next day division of cortez won way to same spot joined that of alvarado seven eighth of city be now destroyed with exception of king palace few temple building have when first saw so excited admiration of spaniard have made city one of loveliest in world have be leveled in portion remained whole of aztec population be crowded number be still vast for before siege began people from many of surrounding city have flocked into capital pestilence be aiding famine in work spanish writer say that a troop advanced body lay so thick that be impossible to walk without treading on again again cortez endeavored to negotiate with emperor although so reduced by weakness that must scarce keep foot aztec maintained defiant attitude advance of ally recommenced aztec fought a bravely a ever be so weakened that missile be no longer dangerous arm must scarce lift weapon be dreadful carnage confederate panting with hatred of race have subdued so long humiliated showed pity even when cortez ordered that quarter must be shown to who asked ally refused to be checked work of slaughter went on until spanish trumpet sounded retreat during day alone be calculated that forty thousand person have fallen that night mournful stillness

seventy thousand loss during siege be also placed at varying figure by contemporary writer lowest estimate be one hundred twenty thousand while writer place at double amount higher figure probably approximate most nearly to truth for population of city in very large be enormously swelled by vast number of person from surrounding city who took refuge there at approach of spaniard spanish loss be comparatively small larger portion of being incurred upon day of destruction of alderete column loss of ally however be very large a be not provided a be spaniard with armor defied missile of enemy of tezcucans alone be said that thirty thousand perished amount of booty taken in city be comparatively small army be bitterly disappointed at poor reward reaped for labor sacrifice there can be doubt that aztec treasure be removed buried before approach of spaniard to city indeed during siege aztec constantly taunted with shout even if ever took city must find gold there to reward effort defense of city of mexico have be frequently likened to of jerusalem against titus in case vast population ignorant of art of war resisted with heroic constancy effort of civilized enemy succumbed to hunger
