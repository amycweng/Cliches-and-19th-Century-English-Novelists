london since ship be paid off two year ago at first of course did matter for have enough to live upon recently have be fool enough to fall in love with girl whose parent must never dream of allowing to marry half pay lieutenant of navy with chance in world of getting employed again for have interest whatever be awkward case certainly prendergast other said upon word though sympathize with can not blame fortescue be not what might call genial man there be doubt that be splendid lawyer wonderful worker for ten year earned more than man at bar know that be twice offered solicitor generalship a be making two three time official salary must not take believe must have gone on working till now have not suddenly come in for very fine estate owing to death in course of two three year of four men who stood between besides fancy got hint that in general opinion of bar have have wonderfully good inning be about time that younger men have share in what saving be know must be very large three son be at bar be rising men so there be occasion for to go on piling up money for a say have always have reputation of being hard man be practically certain that must never allow daughter to marry man whom must regard a next door to pauper now what be thinking of doing well sir miss fortescue have agreed to wait for for two year of course be eager to do something question be what can sail ship even must get command of merchantman must not improve position in eye of parent of lady in question now have be knocking about over world do wish must give advice where be there money to be got be equally ready to go to north pole equator to enter service of indian prince to start in search of treasure hidden by old bucaneers talk spanish yes service have be in mediterranean be two year off coast of spain in out of port a time hung heavily on hand got up language partly to amuse partly to be able to talk fluently with partner at ball elder man did not speak for minute two have not thought of south america said at last mr barnett know have ever thought of one place more than other be again silent think must do better anywhere said slowly be land with great possibility at rate be land where must be understood of course must be folly to go anywhere without knowledge of language be a know five year out there came home when war broke out between chili spaniard have be more in peru than in chili a peru be still in hand of spanish must have be impossible for to go there again a long a war lasted knocking about a did heard great deal from native mean indian gathered from number of tradition be convinced that know of number of gold mine be formerly worked be blocked up when spaniard invaded country have be kept secret ever since native have never spoken on subject at to spaniard if have must have be flogged until revealed knew be to say must have be flogged to death for torture will wring from indian anything know about gold look upon metal a source of misfortune have fallen upon race with englishman whom knew trusted who a also knew have wish whatever to discover gold mine be little le reticent never asked question on subject in have not shadow of interest certainly have curiosity not of pecuniary kind because matter have always be riddle a to hiding place of inca treasure from what learned must say be absolutely certain that great portion of escaped search of spanish tyrant whether men who be employed in work died without revealing secret whether have be trusted to chosen few know not native believe that there be still few among to whom secret have be passed down from father to son anyhow have heard vague tradition said that part of treasure be carried hundred of mile inland given over to tribe of fierce savage in country into european can enter tradition be that portion of be carried off by sea in great canoe be never heard of again be believed to have be lost be not for moment supposing prendergast that if went out there must have most remote chance of discovering what spaniard ever since landed there have be in vain trying to find certainly must not think of recommending mad brained adventure undoubtedly there be many rich gold mine yet to be found there be opening for trade too can give introduction to merchant in chili peru be not thing must recommend to everyone far from if want to combine adventure with chance however small of making money know that can do better than go to south america be fitted for calling here income counting half pay must suffice to keep out there couple of year of life must do harm be just what must like young man said enthusiastically though know how must set to work if did find mine must have to bring home specimen with particular of width of lode of course must crush piece up wash get indian to wash must give approximate idea of percentage of gold if be rich must introduce to men who must advance money for working giving share of profit must send out mining expert with must verify report then must take up concession know whether there have be change in regulation there be difficulty in learning how to proceed from one other of men to whom will give introduction thing must not be worth thinking of be not that man who always went with a guide muleteer be indian have be convinced knowledge of of place be with time be out there saved life when puma sprang upon more than once hinted that must make rich man have inclination that way income being sufficient for want still on chance that be alive be about thirty when be with fifteen year ago so be probable that be still to fore will give letter to telling that be dear friend of mine trust to to do service can for just a must have done for have not be for must never have mentioned matter to old mine be dream of peruvian have be searching for ever since conquest of country a have failed be absurd to think that englishman must have slightest chance of lighting upon mine still le of finding of inca treasure with indian aid be just possible that may find something though must advise most strongly not to build in way upon chance consider that can not possibly win miss fortescue that being so two year of knocking about will not make position worse by time come back may have ceased to struggle against fate will afford remote distinctly remote opportunity of bettering position will give something else to think about besides that young lady charm may even come to recognize life be after possible without may shake head lad know child cry for moon sometimes yet afterwards come to understand that must not be desirable plaything well at rate mr barnett be extremely obliged for suggestion for offer of introduction be just life must enjoy thoroughly a say chance that anything will come of be extremely small at least there be possibility take a drowning man catch at straw by way must think only of gold silver be after chief source of rich of peru there be number of extraordinarily rich mine be calculated that three hundred million have be produced since first occupation by spaniard quicksilver be also very abundant copper lead be found too there be not much to be done with at present owing to cost of carriage there be good shooting in mountain on eastern side of andes will find plenty of sport there talked over matter for time before separated harry prendergast became quite excited over on return to room be astonished to find candle alight strong smell of tobacco pervading place lad of about sixteen leapt from easy chair in have be sitting with foot on hullo harry did expect back so soon maid said be dining out suppose generally mean one o'clock before be back well what brings here bert thought have got off hand for year at least thought so lad said coolly circumstance have be too strong for be running down channel night before last when craft be beating up ran smack into know that be fault more than ours night be dark be very thick did not see other until be within length of luck be against if have be few second quicker must have caught broadside a be rammed knocking hole in side a big a house have just time to jump on board old craft went down two minute after skipper who be of course last man left other fellow have stove bow in luckily be only about couple of mile off dungeness though leaked like sieve be able to run into bay where settled down in two half fathom of water a soon a be light landed tramped to dover hoy be starting for river that evening most of came up in arriving at pool about three hour ago be bad job harry be horribly put out about of course nothing must be saved there be new kit bought for down at bottom sha' bother again have quite made up mind that will ship before mast time five pound note will buy good enough outfit for need not talk about now bertie be certainly unlucky beggar be second time have be wrecked be frightful nuisance boy said be kit be thinking of otherwise must not mind did care for skipper seemed right decent enough before started soon heard from fellow who have sailed with before that be tartar what be worse said be in habit of being drunk two night out of three however have nothing to do with be really awfully sorry harry have be thundering good elder brother hated to think that have to shell out last time have quite made up mind that sha' do again well can not be helped be fault of yours still of course be nuisance thank god that harm have come to be principal thing now sit down go on with pipe young monkey did not think have taken to smoking one have to lad said everyone else doe there be doubt that when have got middle watch on cold night with foul wind be comfort well go on smoking brother said will light up too now shut mouth altogether want to think be silent for fully ten minute then harry said told about business of mine with miss fortescue bertie grinned over face a sat be not visible to brother then with preternatural gravity turned towards yes told about uncomfortable business be surly old father lovely daughter so on will pull ear for young scamp harry said wrathfully if make fun of have good mind not to say what be going to say harry mind feeling lad said ca say did not stand well when be here last week gave end of sympathy go ahead old fellow dare say will be taken bad day then will be able to make allowance for will have nothing more to say to young imp say that harry lad said in tone of alarm know how sympathizing be know what comfort be for to unburden do think that wo be necessary to go into personal description know to tell what said to said to because told ten day ago also what tyrannical old father said really seriously be awfully sorry about if there be anything can possibly do for will be only too pleased see that must be advantage for to go give old gentleman opinion of if think must can coach in of sore point might see how must work upon always thought be young as bertie harry said sternly have not realized before how utterly assified be right harry lad said cheerfully hit a hard a like under circumstance feel that can not kick harry said nothing for five minute be serious matter said at last want tomfoolery all right harry will be a serious a judge be thinking of going away for two year lad turned half round in chair have good look at brother where be going to seeing by harry rather gloomy face that be quite in earnest believe be going to peru what be going there for harry lad said quietly told other went on mr fortescue said that have personal objection to that if be in position to give daughter home equal to wanted to leave must be content bertie nodded seemed to hopeless harry went on told that be willing to wait for two year that must promise much longer than for father have set mind on making good match have certainly put tremendous pressure upon when be talking at club evening to mr barnett know that be oldest friend be one of trustee told about said that though be ready to do anything go anywhere must not see way at to making big fortune straight away agreed with after talking over said knew of one way by thing must be at possible betting must be twenty thousand to one against of course said that if there be even possibility must try well know be in peru for year say that native have sort of legend about rich mine be hidden when spaniard came first that be certain that tremendous a be amount of loot got great part of inca treasure be hidden away once twice there have be great find in one case two million half dollar be believed that secret be still known to certain indian when went out there have muleteer whose life saved when be attacked by beast other man a much a hinted that knew of place where treasure might be concealed a barnett be interested in beast plant sort of thing have comfortable fortune never troubled about one way well offered to give letter to man regarded a just possible that fellow who seems to be descendant of of people who be member of inca court at time spaniard came may have knowledge of rich mine be then closed down that may be able to show to from feeling of gratitude to barnett be one chance in million a can see other possibility of making fortune in two year be going to try of course will lad said excitedly must think that must take with certainly have not dreamt of doing so bertie if have to keep on getting fresh outfit for idea have come into mind during last half hour must not do better harry be sure to be disappointed lot of time before hit on treasure then if be by must get down in mouth now must be able to keep going pat on back when felt sick help to fight indian wild beast be useful in sort of way be like impudence bertie other laughed seriously know will be fool to take if really thought have chance to speak of must not do so though be going to try expect for moment that will succeed feel really must be comfort to have someone with upon whom must rely in life a must have to lead certainly must be lonely work for one man only doubt in mind be whether will be fair to have got profession can go back to if nothing good turn up harry can visit firm tell be going to travel with for bit hope that on return will take back again let finish apprenticeship must think must be rather glad for always build never buy ship will take six month to replace stella besides will do lot of good will pick up spanish at least suppose be language speak out there will learn end of thing a know trade with west coast of america so must be lot more useful to firm when come back than be now well will think over let know in morning must certainly consult mr barnett for be trustee a well a mine if go will work way out will be big expense anyhow mean if possible to draw upon capital beyond three four hundred pound believe living be cheap out there if buy three four mule will then have to pay only wage for muleteer expense of living of course will arrange for income half pay to be sent out to firm at lima now have better go off to bed buoy up with belief that be going for have by mean decided upon taking yet will decide to take harry lad said confidently then added with laugh fact that must have adopted plan like be quite sufficient to show that want somebody to look after harry prendergast did not get much sleep night blamed for having mentioned matter at to bertie yet more thought over more felt that must be very pleasant to have brother with lad be full of fun mischief knew that have plenty of sound sense must be capital companion fact that have be three year at sea be accustomed to turn hand to anything be in favour if nothing came of must only have lost couple of year a boy have said time must not have be altogether wasted bertie be down before in morning looked anxiously at brother a came in well harry well have thought over in light in first place bertie if go with will have to remember that be commanding officer be ten year older than besides be lieutenant in king navy while be only midshipman in merchant service now will expect a ready obedience from a if be captain of own ship one of men be absolutely essential of course harry must not be otherwise very well then in next place will abide by what mr barnett say be guardian a well a trustee have perfect right to put veto upon wild expedition of sort lastly must hope although say that be absolutely necessary that may get employer promise to take back again in order that may complete time thank very much harry lad said gratefully first condition may rely upon being performed think third will be right for know have always be favourably reported upon old prosser told so when said that must have rise in pay voyage a to mr barnett of course ca say must think a be who put up to must see that must be good for to have someone to take care of think be much more likely to say that will have quite enough to do to take care of without having bother of looking after however will go see morning have better call upon employer think have better go to mr barnett with harry not a be now anyhow bertie appearance be positively disgraceful evidently have on worst suit of clothes when be wrecked can see that have not be improved by experience why there be split right down one sleeve big rent in trouser got climbing on board for have time to pick choose with stella sinking under foot well may a well go a be have better borrow needle thread from landlady mend up hole really can not walk through city in state will see about getting more clothes when get back for can not have coming here in in broad daylight here be three guinea get suit of pilot cloth at outfitter at east end will be useful to anyhow whether go with ship again here there be good deal in what say harry mr barnett said when prendergast asked opinion a to taking brother with two year must not make material difference in career a sailor simply mean that will be so much older when pass a mate there be harm in two three twenty be quite young enough for young fellow to become officer think that many captain care about having lad who have just got certificate have not same sense of responsibility same power of managing then too bertie will certainly have good deal of knocking about if spends couple of year in south america knowledge will gain of spanish will add to value with firm trading on coast a far a be concerned think must be great advantage to have with in long expedition such a propose be gain to have companion with make work more pleasant two men can laugh over hardship disagreeables one alone must grumble at apart from be very important in case of illness lonely man laid up with fever accidental injury fare badly indeed if be at distance from town where can obtain medical attendance surrounded only by ignorant native be at one time down with fever for six week in native hut during time must have given pretty nearly be worth for sight of white face sound of english voice a to fact that be possible that lad might catch fever be killed in affray with native must of course be faced a sailor run risk of shipwreck of being washed overboard killed by falling spar everything considered think idea of going with be good one suppose many guardian must be of same opinion have be so many year knocking about in one part of world look at thing in same light a men who have never be out of england be glad see in way sir own that must be great satisfaction to have with certainly must be cheery companion must say that be a hard a nail can stand a much fatigue hardship a besides there be doubt that in case of trouble two men be better than one can not advance money out of thousand pound will come to when be of age by father will be ordered that in event of own death before time interest be to accumulate father foresaw that like probably bertie must take to sea a amount must be fully two thousand pound by time come of age must enable to buy share in ship that might when passed last examination command will myself draw cheque for hundred pound will help towards meeting expense feel to extent responsible for expedition somewhat regret now having ever spoken to on subject for can not conceal from that chance of making discovery where spaniard with power of putting pressure on native for past two three hundred year have failed be so slight a to be scarcely worth consideration tell frankly that broached subject chiefly because thought be much better for to be doing something than kicking heel about london mooning over affair with miss fortescue there be nothing worse for young man than living in london with just enough to keep comfortably without necessity of working therefore thought must be far better travelling hunting for treasure in peru than staying here even if fail a feel be almost certain in object for go out will have plenty to occupy thought not be dwelling continually upon attachment in probability will not turn out satisfactorily suppose that be likely to forget miss fortescue by time return will have accustomed to thought that be useless to cry for moon that after life may be very endurable even if doe not share therefore propounded peruvian adventure feeling sure came of must be benefit to doubt will sir see chance of success be small indeed there be none at in other way be just sort of thing must like quite feel that must be good for to have plenty to think about now that have consented to bertie going with feel more eager than before to undertake expedition place be in rather disturbed state be if be going to wait until peru cease to be in disturbed state harry may wait hundred year spanish rule be bad peru be then pleasant place to live in compared with what be now be sort of cock pit where succession of ambitious rascal struggle for spoil moment one get better of rival fresh intrigue be set on foot fresh rebellion break out there be good peruvian men who have estate live upon who be good master a to politician there be principle whatever at stake be simply question of who will have handling of national revenue divide innumerable post among adherent struggle will not affect largely in one respect will even be advantage bent upon own factious aim combatant have time to concern with doings of english traveller whose object out there be ostensibly to botanize shoot be one of to obtain undisputed control of affair might meddle in sort of way a be after have once got pretty well beyond area of operation can regard doings with indifference knowing that longer go on fighting fewer scoundrel there will be in land even be to think that be mining not science sport took out there must scarcely interfere with be admitted by faction peru need capital for development at present can best be got from country discovery of fresh mine mean employment to large number of people increase of revenue by royalty taxation english explorer who have gone out have never have reason to complain of interference on part of authority will find average better class of peruvian charming people extremely hospitable lady be pretty enough to turn head of anyone whose affection be not already engaged men be kindly courteous in extreme however must have little to do with in mountain must largely depend upon rifle for food on what must get in scattered native village indian have love for peruvian find condition better off under than be under spaniard once find out that be english will do in power for be to cochrane english officer with that owe overthrow expulsion of spanish tyrant be vastly more grateful than chilians peruvian have shown to be on returning to lodging harry met brother who have be into city old prosser be very civil said bertie said that a ship be chiefly in south american trade must be great advantage for to learn to speak spanish well have not yet thought anything about whether must order ship to replace stella at rate at present have vacancy must gladly give permission to travel in south america must find berth to finish apprenticeship when returned more than that said that a have always be so favourably reported upon must put on a supernumerary in para will sail in fortnight for callao must not draw pay must be in service time must count must be great pull must get passage for nothing be capital of course will take passage in too what doe mr barnett say rather to surprise bertie did not disapprove of plan at thought must be good thing for to have with in case of illness anything of sort then doubt thought to extent must keep out of mischief believe thought anything of sort did say so well no did have doubt felt in way sort of relief be very fine know when have be down to place in country between voyage have always be a well behaved a if have be model mid well have heard tale of doings bertie did seem quite in accord with character give oh of course have few lark can not expect fellow who have be away from england for year to walk about a soberly a if be methodist parson must not expect that bertie on other hand must hardly have expected that must for example risk breaking neck by climbing up to top of steeple fastening straw hat on head of weathercock gave very ornamental appearance that weathercock be never before watched so regularly by people of village a be from time till hat be blown away in gale can quite believe still mr barnett told that rector lodged complaint about might complain a much a liked there be law in land a far a know make fixing of straw hat upon weathercock penal offence did end of good in village gave something to talk about woke up wonderfully there be other thing too think brother went on oh well need not go into now be old story besides fancy have heard of various trick played by mr midshipman harry prendergast a heard from lip can not doubt that be strictly veracious well be jolly now when be going to begin to get outfit will lose time about really there be not much to get couple of good rifle two brace of pistol with good store of ammunition clothes have just bought two three suit of duck for voyage sha get special kit until arrive there can take advice of people at lima whether have better travel in european clothes in worn by peruvian of course saddle bridle sort of thing can buy there will want small tent to use when get into out of way place will take three hundred pound in gold have doubt can exchange into silver profitably besides be much more handy for carrying about will go down afternoon see prosser secure berth think will have to arrange that with captain very few of ship have accommodation for passenger captain be allowed to take one two if like right at rate must go to office first can refer to skipper if like must be better than going to direct chapter ii start harry prendergast went down to leadenhall street saw managing owner of para a bertie have anticipated mr prosser after hearing harry statement that wished to take passage to callao in vessel advertised to start in week time that be much obliged to for giving berth a supernumerary midshipman said will certainly have pleasure in putting brother name on ship book have already explained to desire to go out with have have reason to be satisfied with since entered service have better draw pay a usual a service during voyage will then count towards time a for book passenger be more bother than be worth have objection to master taking one two addition of mouth so practically make very little difference in amount of ship store consumed master pay small sum head make own term with passenger take in way be saved complaint a to food other matter of course passenger must put on board for stock of such wine spirit little luxury a may choose will find captain peter down at dock last cargo have be discharged be giving overhaul to rigging making few repair be not man to leave ship if can help while work be going on there harry at once went down well sir captain said when have told that wished to take passage to callao that owner have referred to have fully made up mind must not take passenger again on last voyage be always grumbling at food expecting to be treated a if be in first class hotel be not likely to grumble captain have be knocking about king service since be fourteen oh be royal navy man be sir be be lieutenant make difference have doubt can arrange matter to satisfaction may tell harry said have younger brother coming out with be apprentice nearly out of time be on board stella when be sunk in channel owner have kindly arranged that will go out with a supernumerary be one reason why wish to go in ship master thought for minute two well mr prendergast said like having one of naval gentleman on board if anything go wrong be comfort to have advice if have bad weather round horn must rely upon to give helping hand must need mean that must keep watch anything of sort that must a be stand by have new first mate there be saying how may turn out doubt firm must make enquiry still such enquiry mean much master doe like to damn man by refusing to give good character dare say be all right still must certainly feel very much more comfortable if have naval officer with now sir pay firm twelve pound for passenger take a share of cabin store pay that will ask for nothing for passage can not say fairer than that can not indeed captain feel very much obliged to for offer very much obliged will suit admirably in case of emergency may rely upon aid if have spell of bad weather will be quite willing to take watch for know that in long heavy gale meet with going round horn officer get terribly overtaxed how about brother captain said a be to be supernumerary suppose that only mean that firm be willing that will put in time for rating have never have supernumerary on board suppose be to be regarded a passenger rather than one of ship complement no captain be to be on pay sheet think have much better be put into watch must find time hang very heavy on hand if have nothing to do know be anxious to learn profession thoroughly a be to be paid there be reason why must not work very well if think so will say nothing more about thought perhaps must like to have aft with be much obliged to think other way will be best be sure must feel more comfortable with other apprentice than a passenger be going out for long may ask mr prendergast for couple of year so be going to wander about do shooting exploring that sort of thing be taking with a companion speak spanish fairly well will teach on voyage if will allow to do so knowledge of language will be advantage to when come back into prosser co service great advantage captain agreed most of speak little spanish have often thought that must pay company to send man who must talk lingo well in ship must call supercargo be sure must pay wage three four time over by being able to bargain arrange with chilians peruvian in port like callao where there be british consul thing be right in little port be fleeced right left boatman shopkeeper charge two three time a much a do own countryman be sure that must get better bargain in hide other produce if have someone who must knock down price when do sail captain day week will be high tide about eight will start to warp out of dock good half hour earlier so can either come on board night before about seven in morning very well sir will be here in good time will bring thing on board with be of use sending on before a will not be bulky can be stored away in cabin will be state room captain said opening door have one aft first mate have one opposite to others be empty so can stow baggage that have in one of second third officer apprentice be in deck house cabin in case captain will send wine spirit on board day before of course will get out of bond might have difficulty in doing so early in morning will perhaps be good enough to order to be stowed in one of empty cabin will be best plan captain said when do apprentice come on board morning before sail there be always plenty to be done in getting last store on board right brother will be here good morning captain thank following morning at eleven harry prendergast be standing in front of entrance to british museum young lady came up be very imprudent of harry said after first greeting to ask to meet must not help dear be absolutely necessary must see be of use harry consider that be of particular use hilda know harry when have very unpleasant talk with father be called in said that have promised to wait two year for when found must not give way promised that must not press on understanding that be not to meet again except in public promised quite so dear appears to that be surely public place harry what meant be be not to meet except at party well must have asked to meet to day even if have have to storm father house to see be going away dear must scarcely say much if came along found talking here see be not likely that must stumble across fortune in street of london have talked matter over with barnett know trustee have met once twice came to conclusion that only possible chance of being able to satisfy father a to mean be for to go to peru try to discover gold mine there hidden treasure such discovery have be made may be made again have supplied with letter to indian who may possibly be able to help to peru harry why be always fighting there yes do good deal of squabbling people in general have little to do with certainly be not going out to take part in revolution there be not shadow of doubt that number of gold mine worked by old people be never discovered by spaniard be also certain that great portion of treasure of inca be still lying hid barnett saved life of muleteer out there from what said believed that man did know something about one of lost mine might possibly let into secret be just off chance be only chance can see promised father that must never marry without consent must never give unless be rich man if nothing come of adventure will be worse off than be at present if be fortunate enough to discover rich mine hidden treasure will be in position to satisfy demand be going to take bertie with will be cheerful companion even now be powerful young fellow at rate if get sick anything of sort must be immense advantage to have with like idea of going harry said tearfully dear if have chance of seeing sometimes of day obtaining father consent to marriage gold mine in peru must offer temptation to a be can see nothing else for in respect be better if be to stay here must only be meeting frequently at dance dinner never able to talk to privately feeling always that must never be mine must be constant torture here be possibility very remote one admit still possibility even if fails will have satisfaction of knowing have done that man must do to win think be best that must go somewhere harry peru seems to be horrible place barnett speaks of in high term know be four five year out there describes people a being delightful have nothing to say against climate will not try to dissuade said bravely after pause at present be hopeless will have something to hope pray for while be away will say good bye now dear have come to meet once will not do so again meeting must give fresh pain be very glad to know that brother be going with will not have to imagine that be ill in out of way place without friend near in spite of danger may have to run must rather think of a bravely doing best than eating heart out here in london will not tell father that have met here have better write to say that be leaving london at once that hope in two year to return claim in accordance with promise be sure will be glad to know that have gone that will not be constantly meeting will be kinder to than have be of late for a will think quite impossible that can make fortune in two year will be inclined to dismiss altogether from mind for half hour talked together then parted with renewed protestation on part that nothing must induce to break promise to wait for for two year have given address of one of merchant to whom mr barnett have promised letter of introduction so that might from time to time write for voyage must take at least four month a much more must be required for first letter to come back walked moodily home after parting with hullo harry nothing wrong with hope why look a grave a owl feel grave bertie have just said good bye to hilda though kept up spirit made best of expedition of ours can not feel how improbable be that will meet again be to say in present relation for if fail certainly will not return home for year must be only fair to must not do so know that must keep on a long a there be hope must not care to think that be wasting life be as to believe must ever be otherwise feel that best thing for must have be for to go away a soon a found that be getting fond of well of course can not understand seems to that one girl be very like may be bit prettier than average suppose come to same thing in twenty year can understand man getting awfully fond of ship especially when be clipper however day may feel different besides how must tell that father must turn out crusty old beggar suppose did not think about one way other bertie harry said quietly however mischief be done even if there be chance whatever of making money must go now for own sake a well a hers well be of use talking more about will go out now buy rifle sha get new one can pick up gun just a good at price a know something about rifle be not likely to be taken in of course have got pistol only have brace to buy for will have time on voyage to practise with if did not do that must be a likely to shoot a hostile indian oh be boy said still certainly must like to be good shot after getting rifle pistol harry went into city ordered six dozen of wine three dozen of brandy to be sent on board out of bond also ordered bag of twenty pound of raw coffee chest of tea couple of dozen bottle of pickle sauce to be sent down to dock on day before para sailed suit of seafaring clothes stock of underclothing be ordered for bertie harry spent intervening time before vessel sailed in looking up friend saying good bye to drove down to dock at appointed time brother having joined ship on previous day para be barque rigged ship of eight hundred ton at present did not show to advantage deck being littered with store of kind have come on board late deck plank where must be seen be almost black sail have be partly loosed from gasket to eye accustomed to neatness order of man of war appearance be by mean favourable side shone with fresh paint looking at line from wharf harry thought must be fast good sea boat be not heavily laden stood boldly up in water nodding to bertie who be working hard among men went up on to poop from captain peter be shouting order glad to see sir captain said look rather in litter at present doe will get ataunto before get down to nore confounded people wo send store on board till last moment if be owner must tell shipper that good must be received within five six hour of ship time for sailing must give fair chance instead of starting in muddle just at time too when more than other one want to have deck free for making short tack down narrow reach believe wreck on sand at mouth of river be due to confusion in ship start how can crew be lively in getting yard over when have to go about deck lumbered up like half of be only just recovering from bout of drink day before up to last moment everyone on board be hard at work when order be given to throw off hawser deck be already comparatively clear hour later vessel passed out through dock gate with two boat towing ahead so a to take well out into river rest of crew be employed in letting sail drop a soon a gathered way men in boat be called in boat being towed behind in case might again be required passage from pool to mouth of river be in day most dangerous portion of voyage there be tug to seize ship carry down to open water while channel below nore be badly buoyed lighted be uncommon thing for twenty vessel to get upon sand in course of single tide wind be light being northerly helped well on way be only in one two reach that para be unable to lay course overtook many craft have be far ahead of answered helm quickly be fast handy see harry prendergast who have be watching movement with interest remarked yes there be not many craft out of london can show heel when wind be free doe not look quite so well into wind a must wish still think be a good a most of suppose will get down to gravesend before tide turn yes will anchor there wind be not strong enough for to stem tide run like sluice there once past nore one can do better there be fighting tide here unless one have steady breeze aft never feel really comfortable till be fairly round south foreland after that be plain sailing enough though there be few shoal in channel one can give wide berth fog be thing have to fear there yes have never be down river having always joined ship at portsmouth plymouth so know very little about know from men who have be on board vessel commissioned at chatham sheerness that be thankful indeed when once get round goodwins head west well mr prendergast be against new fangled steamboat suppose true sailor be when marjory began to run between london gravesend eighteen year ago in ' think be folk did say that must not be long before sailing craft must be driven off sea did not believe that then believe now do say that hope before long there will be lot of small steamer on thames to tow vessel down till be off north foreland must be blessing comfort to master mariner once there have choice of going outside goodwins taking short cut inside if wind be aft why sir must add year to life shorten voyage by week there be now sometimes lying off nore five hundred sail waiting for wind to shift out of east when do get under weigh have always to keep lead going one never know when one may bump upon sand master will grope way along in dark for part always anchor there be few enough buoy beacon in daytime consider that be tempting providence to try go down in dark night owner be sensible men know that be not worth while running risk just to save day two when have got four month voyage before once past dover be ready to hold on with anyone between nore north foreland pick way a carefully a woman going across muddy street be quite right captain thoroughly agree with more ship get ashore going down to mouth of thames than in other part of world a say if sailing ship might be taken down by steamer must be making of port of london brother be smart young chap mr prendergast be watching yesterday be working away now a if liked work have making of first rate sailor hold that man will never become first class seaman unless like work for own sake there be three sort of hand there be fellow who shirks work whenever have chance there be man who doe work who doe because have to do always look glad when job be over there be lad who jump to work chuck right into put last ounce of strength on rope be fellow who will make good officer who if need be can set example to men when have to go aloft to reef sail in stiff gale so a understand mr prendergast be going to leave sea for bit seems pity too will be none worse for captain year so knocking about among mountain of peru will do more good to than equal time on board ship will sharpen up give habit of reliance confidence will be better for afterwards even putting aside advantage will be to to pick up spanish yes may do good captain agreed if doe not take away liking for sea think will do that if first voyage two sicken lad think be pretty certain be cut out for sea of course be very hard life at first especially if officer be rough lot when boy get to know duty thing go more easily with be accustomed to surroundings take to food know be not always of best with good appetite bertie have have three year of now when have come home have never heard grumble from be not likely to meet with such luxury while be knocking about a to make turn up nose at salt junk tide be already turning when reached gravesend a soon a anchor be down steward came up to say that dinner be ready be not at sorry harry said a went below with captain ate good breakfast before started at half past six went below have biscuit bottle of beer at eleven feel a hungry a hunter now there be nothing like sea appetite have be nearly two year on shore never enjoyed meal a do at sea crew have be busy ever since left dock deck have now be scrubbed made tidy presented very different appearance from met harry eye a came on board johnson first mate also dined with skipper be tall powerfully built man be singularly taciturn took share in conversation unless directly asked seemed however to be able to appreciate joke never laughed audibly contenting with drawing lip apart showing teeth wind be light baffling so that did not round south foreland until seventh day after leaving dock after that be favourable steady ran without change until approached line then there be fortnight of calm at last got wind again made rapid run until within five hundred mile of cape horn captain be in high glee have done capitally so far mr prendergast think ever made so rapid run if go on like will reach callao within three month of starting think weather will continue like mate said be first original observation have made since have sailed harry captain looked at in surprise think there be going to be change mr johnson captain said after short pause to recover from astonishment mate nodded glass falling sky hazy be glass falling be ashamed to say have not looked at for past twenty four hour have stuck so long at same point have quite ceased to look at two three time day a usually do have not fallen much be sinking captain got up from table went to look at glass be right have fallen good eighth may mean change of wind did notice change mr prendergast ca say that did looked up a sailor always doe when be on deck morning be clear enough then have not noticed particularly since when went up on deck hour later agreed that mate be right change overhead be slight away to west dull reddish mist seemed to obscure horizon will get upper sail off at once mr johnson storm come so suddenly off coast that be a well to lose time in shortening sail when one see indication of such change mate at once gave necessary order sailor started up with look of surprise look sharp men mate said will have wind plenty of will be here before long men who be by mean sorry for spell of work after going so long without shifting sail tack worked hard white sheet of canvas be soon snugly furled by time sailor who have be to sea for time recognized utility of work low bank have risen extended whole width of western horizon what do think prendergast have got enough off know about storm here captain if be in levant must get stitch of canvas off excepting closely reefed topsail storm jib fore stay sail first burst over one can always shake out more canvas however know sea think be right pamperos a call be not to be trifled with in case there be time to be lost captain with permission will lend hand hand take in sail captain shouted mate led way up starboard shroud while harry throwing off coat mounted to port closely followed by bertie five minute hard work para be stripped for struggle be good job done skipper said to harry a reached deck very good job sir wind may come be prepared for there be nothing like being ready in time be in good trim for said captain not above two third laden a wind be off land there be nothing to worry except falklands will go outside of course will lengthen voyage with westerly wind must not care about being between mainland think same mr prendergast do sir be scattered group must not be pleasant to have under lee have grown sensibly darker line of mist have not risen higher harry remarked upon almost doubt whether be coming after said captain shook head doe not spread over sky said because be largely dust blown off land after first burst will see that will have bright blue sky roaring wind just a one get sometimes in easterly gale in channel will have in five minute fancy think will be very strong must have have here before be not long before dull moaning sound be heard brown red fog changed appearance swirl of vapour seemed to dash out in front of whole swelled heaved a if be being pushed forward by tremendous pressure in rear ship head be pointing nearly east canvas hung down motionless there be not breath of wind hold on captain shouted minute later billowly cloud swept across vessel sudden darkness overspread then there be glow of white light line of foam approached a fleet a race horse with shriek gale be upon vessel shook from stem to stern a if have struck against rock bow be pressed down lower lower until seemed a if be going to dive head foremost a gathered way bow rose in minute be flying along at eighteen knot hour be right now mr prendergast captain said be well stripped so thoroughly that be not heavily laden four men have be placed at wheel needed strength to keep from yawing in hour sea began to get up captain laid course south east put wind on quarter be well be not degree so farther south captain yes must have be a much a must do to weather falklands for with small amount of sail must have made terrible amount of leeway a be be fair sailing darkness gradually passed away in hour after gale have struck para be sailing under bright blue sky although few point off wind be lying down till lee scupper be under water spray be flying over sparkling in sun sailor be crouched under weather bulwark lashed to belaying pin stanchion to prevent from shifting down to leeward six hour later be evident that there be slight diminution in force of wind be going about fourteen knot now captain said can head more to south must be nearly abreast of island according to reckoning forty fifty mile to east of be now dark watch be sent below to morrow morning will be able to get more sail on master said hope by next morning squall will be over for will then have made southing wind will be right in teeth when turn head west there be saying way will come when squall dy out what do think johnson be pretty sure to get hot from one quarter man said must say most likely from south except for cold must be better than west harry remarked yes if be not too strong be likely to be strong after gale a have have seldom settle down for time a like a not there will be bad weather for next month next morning when harry went on deck saw that reef have be shaken out of topsail spanker hoisted there be still fresh wind have backed round more to south there be so sharp nip in that went below put on pea jacket then beckoned to bertie who be off duty to join on poop have be smart blow bertie yes have worse than that last time came round horn think will be shortening sail again before long cloud be banking up to south west be good sea boat be have behaved uncommonly well will want clothes before night bertie be may when started be nearly mid winter down here there be one thing sha have so much risk of coming across drifting iceberg most of will be frozen up hard fast down in south matter much when weather be clear if be thick one have awful time of on first voyage be like tell did think be going to see england again have desperately close shave wind speedily freshened by evening ship be under close reefed canvas again cloud be flying fast overhead air be thick before evening watch be set ship be brought round on other tack be running to east of south will lie on course till morning mr prendergast said captain then if wind hold think will be able to make long leg weather horn for six day storm raged with unabated violence cold be intense spray breaking over bow froze a fell crew be engaged for hour at time in breaking up mass of ice thus formed harry have volunteered to take watch in turn with first second mate captain be almost continuously on deck twice encountered iceberg once in driving snow storm nearly ran foul of one fortunately be daylight whole crew being on deck be able to put vessel about just in time during time vessel have only gained few mile westing on board be utterly exhausted with struggle against bitter wind hand be sore bleeding through pulling upon frozen rope face inflamed eyelid so swollen sore that must scarcely see then wind began to abate more sail being got on para be able to lie course chapter iii at lima three day later sky cleared captain getting observation found that have rounded southernmost point of cape day para head be turned north week later be running smoothly along before gentle breeze with coast of chili twenty mile away heavy wrap have be laid aside although air be still frosty crew felt warm after what have endured upper spar yard have be sent up be now carrying crowd of canvas mate have thawed out under more congenial surroundings have worked like horse during storm setting example whether in going aloft in work of clearing off ice from bow even when watch be relieved seldom went below well hope mr johnson will sail together until get next step captain said must not wish for better first officer want nothing better sir be fine ship well manned well commanded begin to feel at home in now at first did hate change though last captain sailed with be surly fellow got on very well together must rather sail with man like than with skipper who be always talking be silent man be quite content to eat meal enjoy without having to stop time be putting fork into mouth to answer question other be once six month up in north without ever speaking to soul be whaling then snow storm came on when be fast on to fish be twenty four hour before cleared off when did there be ship to be seen be in inlet at time in baffin bay thought that ship must come back landed hauled up boat ship did come back a learned long afterwards be never heard of again suppose got nipped between two iceberg winter be coming on fast men agreed that must rather try make way south overland than stay there told that be fool admit that prospect of winter there be enough to frighten man did not like thought be wiser to remain there than to move of men went along shore out in boat managed to kill several sea cow made sledge piled meat on started meanwhile have be busy building sort of hut piled great stone against foot of cliff turned boat upside down to form roof men helped to do job last thing before started then blocked up entrance leaving only just room for to crawl in out snow began to fall steadily three day after others have gone very soon covered hut two foot deep melted blubber of whale in boat baler for have towed fish ashore first potful two boiled over few bit of drift wood after that be easy enough a unravelled of boat rope dipped in hot blubber made store of big candle there be lot of meat left on sea cow so cut that up froze stowed a much a must in hut be bothered about rest a knew bear be likely to come down found ledge on face of perpendicular rock by putting boat mast against be able to get up to here piled must say ton of meat blubber then set to work collected dried grass soon have enough to serve a bed cover took month to do by time winter be down on in earnest have spent evening in making out of skin of three cow breech high boot coat with hood over head in order to make soft rubbed with hot oil be rough thing hoped might get bear later on fortunately boat have two balers for required one in to melt snow over lamp well sir lived there during winter did not find altogether dull for have several bit of excitement for month so bear wolf came down fought over carcass of whale when be eaten up turned attention to over over again tried to break in have better have left alone for though be strong enough to have pulled away rock blocked entrance must not stand fire a have amount of rope used to soak in rock oil set on fire shove out of entrance twice small bear managed to wriggle up passage have sharpened boat hook managed to kill one skin made whole suit other first rate blanket not that be ever unpleasantly cold for couple of big candle thick coating of snow over kept place a warm a cared for occasionally when bear have cleared off went out climbed mast got fresh supply down have made desperate effort to get at meat face of rock be luckily too smooth for to get hold when spring came ice broke up planted mast on top of cliff with sail fastened a flag month after sea be clear whaler came in took off be how pretty well lost use of tongue though be better than be use much now except on duty that certainly account for harry said must have have awful time think minded very much sir except when be bothered by bear slept good lot think at first used to talk out loud good deal soon dropped that though used to whistle sometimes when be cooking food think must have held on so long if have only have sea cow flesh bear made nice change only wished that one two more have managed to crawl in wonder be able to kill with boat hook did sir know whaler carry axe to cut line if necessary be able to split skull a crawled in before must get fairly on to foot use paw be getting very weak with scurvy towards end a soon a snow melted plant began to shoot be able to collect green stuff so be nearly well by time be picked up weather continued fine time be coasting up chilian coast be week at valparaiso getting out cargo have brought for town did trading at smaller port at last just four month after leaving england dropped anchor off callao well have be jolly voyage harry brother said a be rowed ashore after hearty farewell from captain first officer be glad enjoyed bertie be sorry time have taken passage for aft be better pleased to have be at work must have be awfully slow otherwise mate be good fellow got on well with other apprentice tried at first not to turn out on night watch a be not obliged to do so soon gave up seemed disgusting to be lying there when others have to turn out have be jolly voyage be glad that be here at last be going to set to work in search of treasure have begun to think that must not get on shore to day harry said a neared landing place what with three hour waiting for medical officer three for bumptious official whom call port officer without whose permission one be allowed to land think everyone on board be so disgusted that must have liked nothing better than to pitch fellow overboard be rather amusing to watch boatman crowding round shouting praise of own craft running down others little of go long way be same pretty nearly at port have entered boatman be harpy of worst kind be lucky that have so little baggage tip of couple of dollar be enough to render custom house officer not only civil servile a mounted step be assailed by motley crowd half of whom struggled to get near to hold out hand for alms while other half struggled fought for right of carrying baggage accustomed to such scene harry at once seized upon two of gave portmanteau keeping behind pushed through crowd telling to lead way to hotel that captain have recommended a being least filthy in place crossed square covered with good of kind there be long row of great jar filled with native spirit bale of cinchona bark pile of wheat from chili white rose coloured block of salt pyramid of unrefined sugar block of great bar of silver among again be bale box landed from foreign country log of timber old anchor chain number of people who appeared to have nothing to do sauntered about sat on log in odd corner be native woman engaged in making picanties upon poor largely exist be composed of fresh salt meat potato crab juice of bitter orange lard salt abundance of pepper pod be sort of thing will have to eat bertie well must not mind if have not got to look on at making smell uncommonly good hotel be larger even more dirty than captain description have led to expect however dinner be served to be better than have looked for being very hungry after long wait did full justice to might have be good deal worse bertie must think so after four month of salt junk be splendid cup of really good coffee followed by little glass of native spirit added to satisfaction have hesitated before whether to push on at once to lima wait there till next morning meal decided must start at daybreak so a to get to lima before sun became really hot harry asked landlord to bargain for two riding mule one for baggage to be ready at hour then strolled out to view place although bertie assured brother that there be nothing whatever to see in may be bertie be not going to begin by being lazy there be always something to see in foreign land by who keep eye open after hour walk harry be inclined to think that brother be right house be generally constructed of cane plastered with mud painted yellow a result of earthquake scarce house stood upright leaned sideways looked a if be going to topple over into road while others leaned back a if be to push against must collapse crush inmate night be not pleasant one bed be simple consisting only of hide stretched across wooden frame a very speedily found there be numerous other inhabitant therefore slept little be heartily glad when first gleam of dawn appeared slipping on clothes ran down to shore have bath by time returned breakfast be ready coffee fish egg mule did not appear for hour by time patience be exhausted portmanteau be speedily strapped on to back of baggage mule mounted two others muleteer have brought one for fastening baggage animal behind started be six mile to lima a city be five hundred twelve foot above sea ascent be steady somewhat steep road be desperately bad country uninteresting being for most part dried up occasionally saw great mound of adobe brick remains of ancient habitation a neared town vegetation became general small canal irrigating country here be fruit vegetable garden with orange plantain vine flower passing through gate in wall entered town afforded pleasant contrast to squalid misery of callao city however must not be called imposing house be low irregular fantastically painted in square stripe almost have great balcony shut in with trellis work few of house have window towards street larger one being constructed with central courtyard into room opened street be built at right angle principal one leading from grand square in stood cathedral palace of spanish viceroy other side consisting of private house with shop arcade below hotel to have be recommended be large building with courtyard with dining other room opening from above bedroom in comparison with inn at callao be magnificent in point of cleanliness left great deal to be desired after settling in room went out change in temperature since have left callao have be very great first thing to do bertie be to buy couple of good poncho see native be wearing certainly want something of sort harry thought be heat that be going to suffer from seems just other way to judge from temperature might be in scotland damp mist chill one to bone be not much surprised for of course got subject up a much a must before starting barnett told that lima be altogether exceptional place that while be bright warm during winter month from may till november on plain only few mile away even in summer month there be almost always clammy mist at lima that inside house a well a outside everything streamed with moisture said that have never be satisfactorily accounted for say that be due to coldness of river here rimac come down from snowy mountain others think that cold wind always blow down valley of river meet wind from sea here moisture contained in be thus precipitated believe that few mile higher up will get out of atmosphere altogether still poncho will be very useful for will be really cold up in mountain serve for cloak in daytime blanket at night best be made of wool of guanaco sort of llama wool be very fine before start will get two of coarser wool to use a blanket to sleep on while have finer one to cover there be difficulty in finding shop with good wanted price even of best be very moderate next bought two soft felt hat with broad brim be ever so much more comfortable will wait until to morrow before begin what may call business bertie of course will deliver other letter of introduction that mr barnett gave principal one to former muleteer be more important than put together if anything have happened to there be end of chance whatever of finding treasure of course may have moved away be absent on journey with mule in case will have to follow wait for return must be frightful nuisance yes still be one of thing that foresaw might happen vote go at once harry see if be here think will find here for barnett said that lived in village of miraflores five mile away on north that if be not there senor pasquez to whom have letter will be likely to tell where be to be found for be often employed by however be a anxious a to see a be only eleven o'clock yet there be reason why must not go to miraflores will get mule for at hotel tell road to take be not necessary however to go into hotel for when returned two three men with mule be waiting to be hired engaged two animal a man of whom hired have third be ready to accompany for small fee agreed to take with before be mile out of town mist cleared off sun shone brightly heat however be by mean too great to be pleasant miraflores be charming village rather small town nestling among garden orchard want to find muleteer named dia otero harry said to guide a rode into place know well said everyone about here know dia wife be cousin of mother do know whether be at home now yes senor saw in lima three day ago have just come down from mountain have be away two month certainly will not have started again so soon will lead to house at once do so be to see have come to town worked for long time with friend of mine year ago have brought message from may be time talking with so when go in can tie up mule for while be house man said presently lay in outskirt of town be neater than generality of house garden be mass of flower dismounted handed over mule to owner walked to door indian of five forty year came out a did so be dia otero harry asked same senor have just arrived from england bring letter to from senor barnett with whom travelled for two three year time ago man face lit up with pleasure will enter senor friend of senor barnett may command service in way be delight to hear from writes to sometimes in trouble letter always come love senor there never be kinder master once saved life at risk of own be there hope of coming out again think so dia be strong well think be likely to start again on journey of exploration be greatest friend brother be left under charge when be young have be almost father to be who have sent out to here be letter will read to senor can not read be always obliged to get somebody to read letter write answer for letter be of course in spanish harry read dear friend dia be sending out to gentleman mr prendergast officer of british navy in whom be deeply interested brother accompanies beg that will treat a must service can render consider a rendered to from reason will no doubt explain to in time be of deepest importance to that must grow rich in course of next two year asked advice said to 'there be one know of who must possibly put in way of so doing better than friend dia otero believe be in power to do so if be willing ' also believe that for sake will aid will place wholly in hand doe not care what danger run what hardship have to go through in order to attain purpose know that need not say more to have two year before long before be sure will be a interested in a be in have sufficient mean to pay expense of travel for time will be out there know that be descended from noble of high rank at court of inca when spaniard arrived that secret known to few be passed down from father to son in family if can use of secret to advantage of friend pray most earnestly to do so trust that letter will find good wife in health have be ten year younger must have come out with friend to aid in adventure know that in putting into hand will be doing vastly greater service than must do be able to come in person when harry ceased indian sat for time without speaking then said be matter must think over senor be very grave one have other man than senor barnett asked service of money must have tempted to assent to be not only that life must be in danger that name must be held up to execration by people be to divulge secret even torture of spaniard must not wring from must think over before answer suppose be staying at hotel morin will call see when have thought matter over be grave question may be three four day before can decide thank dia there be occasion for to give final decision now whether will travel for while trust that will go with with mule be guide a did to mr barnett will be time enough when know better to give final answer be not to be expected that even for senor barnett sake must do immense service for stranger therefore pray to leave matter open make arrangement for mule for three month journey in mountain show what there be to see of gold silver placer quicksilver mine at huanuco at end of time will know can say whether be ready to aid in search native bowed head gravely will think over said now senor let put that aside wife have be busy since entered in preparing simple meal ask to honour by partaking of with pleasure dia consisted of puchero stew consisting of piece of beef cabbage sweet potato salt pork sausage meat pig foot yucca banana quince pea rice salt abundance of chili pepper have be cooked for six hour be now warmed up two bottle of excellent native wine flask of spirit water be also put on table indian declined to sit down with saying that have taken meal hour before while ate chatted with asking question of voyage telling of state of thing in country be always same senor there be revolution two three battle then president one who want to be president escape from country be taken shot in day two there be fresh pronunciamiento thought that when spaniard have be driven out must have have peace be not so have have san martin bolivar aguero santa cruz sucre bolivar again finally defeated spaniard at ayacucho rodil held possession of callao castle defended until january of year in village have not suffered who liked fighting went out with one other of general have returned others have be killed have suffered greatly sometimes people have taken one side sometimes other though general supported be sometimes victorious for short time in end suffered most of old spanish family perished number died in castle of callao where many thousand of best blood of lima took refuge of well nigh half died of hunger misery before rodil surrendered doe not make travelling very unsafe indian shrugged shoulder peru be large country senor who want to keep out of way of army lighting can do so have continued occupation have never fallen in with army be because fighting be principally in plain round cuzco for men go into mountain except a fugitive a must not find food there for army be fugitive who render road somewhat unsafe starving men must take what can get interfere with great silver convoy from potosi other mine loaf of bread be worth more than bar of silver in mountain will plunder person coming down with good to town going up with purchase once twice have have to give up food carried with have have little to grumble at think need trouble about will take care to avoid a far a possible after chatting for hour left cottage mounting mule returned to lima think will help harry bertie said a soon a set out think so too must not press to begin with of course there be question too a to how far can help may know vaguely where rich mine once existed must remember that have be lost for three hundred year may be impossible for even man who have received tradition a to position to hit upon precise spot mountain see be tremendous there must be innumerable ravine gorge among be certain that nothing approaching accurate map can ever have be made of mountain must say that in most case indication may have be given be very vague must no doubt have be sufficient for who lived soon after money be hidden be native of part of country thoroughly acquainted with surroundings when information came to be handed down from mouth to mouth during many generation local knowledge must be lost what be at first detailed instruction must become little better than vague legend know how three hundred year will alter face of country rock roll down hill torrent wash away soil forest grow be cleared away believe with that indian will do best have grave doubt whether will be able to locate big thing well take very cheerful view of thing harry certainly seemed more hopeful when first started yes say be not hopeful still be one thing to plan out enterprise at distance quite when be face to face with execution a have come down coast seen that great range of mountain stretching along for hundred of mile know that there be quite a big lying behind have begun to realize difficulty of adventure that be undertaking however will hear when dia come over to see what think of matter fancy will say that be willing to go with help a far a can although will do best can not promise that will be able to point out with anything like certainty position of of old mine next day called on senor pasquez who received very cordially so be going to follow example of senor barnett spend time in exploring country doing shooting have found dia yes senor think will go with though have not given positive answer will be fortunate if get be one of best known muleteer in country if anyone come here want guide dia be sure to be first to be recommended if go with can give much useful advice know exactly what will have to take with best district to visit for purpose best way of getting there for rest will be very happy to take charge of money may wish to leave behind to act a banker cash order may draw upon will also receive place to account sum may be sent from england that sir be matter mr barnett advised to place in hand after making what few purchase require taking fifty pound in silver will have two hundred fifty pound to place in hand mr barnett will manage affair in absence will send to fifty pound quarterly will find difficulty in spending in two year merchant said with smile if be content to live on can be bought in country cost very little a for mule can generally pick up enough at halting place to serve with small allowance of grain can hire cheaply can buy latter be cheaper in end can not be sure of getting mule accustomed to mountain must therefore run risk of losing foothold not only being dashed to piece destroying saddle load however if secure service of dia otero will get mule know path in mountain be famous for animal be considered most trusty muleteer here men think lucky in obtaining service must send with load of uncounted gold must be sure that there must not be piece missing next day dia came to hotel have thought over senor said need not say that be only ordinary service instead of exploring mountain must be glad indeed to do best for friend of senor barnett a to real purpose of journey wish before making arrangement that matter must be thoroughly understood have certain knowledge a to of lost mine still le of hidden treasure know tradition have passed down concerning doubt whether indian now posse certain knowledge of thing for generation doubt secret be handed down from father to son be possible that few may still know of place doubt think of hundred thousand of people who have be killed in battle died a slave in mine will see that number of to whom secret be entrusted must have taken knowledge to grave with in generation number of who knew particular of hiding place must have diminished few now can know more than do yet be sure of nothing know generally where mine be situated where treasure be concealed what knowledge have will place at service so great care be used in concealment of entrance to mine so carefully be hiding place of treasure chosen so cunningly concealed that without surest indication most minute instruction might search for year a men indeed have done ever since spanish came here without finding be glad can lay hand upon heart say that may have be possessed by ancestor of mine actual detail have ever come down to for have be so must not have revealed to know that who be instructed in be bound by most terrible oath not to reveal number have died under torture rather than break oath even now be one of to betray secret have come down to must be regarded a accursed one must break bread with door must be closed against if died body must rot where fell knowledge be merely general gathered not only from tradition known to people from confidence made by one member of family to full knowledge be undoubtedly given to of must have died without initiating others into full particular such knowledge a have be at disposal can take to locality can say to 'near place be great mine ' unless chance favour may search in vain be quite a much a have hoped for dia be grateful for willingness to do what can for just a did for senor barnett chapter iv street fray now senor dia said a have settled main point let talk over arrangement what be weight of baggage not more than mule must carry of course will sling rifle over shoulder have good stock of ammunition for for pistol will take two suit of clothes besides wear case of spirit in event of accident illness will have three flannel shirt stocking so on certainly everything belonging to personally must not mount up to more than hundred fifty pound must of course require few cooking utensil tin plate mug cup what must need besides tent bedding senor must only have at start to carry such provision a must not buy when be beyond range of village in forest might often be week without being able to buy anything still must probably be able to shoot game for food must find fruit flour will have to take with from last town pas through before strike into mountain

when return of evening to find hot supper ready for be quite true be sure will find wife great acquisition to party only difference will be that instead of one large tent must have two small one doe not matter how small so long a can crawl into be long enough for to lie down now about payment will not overcharge dia said with smile if wife have remained behind must have asked for money to

be of vicuna skin with wool still on with leather kept well oiled will keep out water will want in hill will sometimes find village where can sleep in shelter not for dia mr barnett have told that house be for most part alive with flea must prefer to sleep in tent however small rather than lie in bed on floor of one of want thick bed know couple of thickness of well quilted cotton say inch thick two foot wide can get made for doubt indian nodded must be best for travel bed peruvian caballeros use be very thick bulky will want two for wife two for jose by by will want tent for dia smiled

bed blanket making of bed tent will take time people hurry in lima there will be riding saddle bridle to get provision think can be ready before week will be well then that must before starting away visit ruin of pachacamac traveller go there will seem only natural that must do so for there will see style of building also exploration be everywhere made by spaniard in search of treasure very well dia then day week will be ready to start however suppose will see day learn how be getting on with preparation bertie have be sitting at window looking down into street while conversation be going on well what be about asked turning round a indian left room be satisfactory more than satisfactory brother answered in first place nephew lad of fifteen who be training a mule driver be going with be much better than getting outsider in next place wife be going with good gracious bertie exclaimed what in world will do with woman well think will do very well with bertie well ill have to go will not let husband go without be natural enough considering how long will be away that journey will be dangerous one really think will be acquisition to party be bright pretty a doubt noticed what be of more importance be capital cook certainly gave good meal yesterday bertie said though must rough on anything be decidedly pleasanter to have well cooked meal well see be right how many mule be to take five for baggage three for riding have doubt dia wife will ride behind boy when want to ride will perch on one of baggage mule dia have five mule will only have to buy three for riding what be going to cost harry bertie said when brother have told arrangement have be made be most important point after well will be astonished when tell bertie that if succeed in finding treasure of kind will only have to pay for three riding mule expense of food so on hundred dollar twenty pound bertie said incredulously be joking be really so man said that considered that in going with be only fulfilling obligation be under to mr barnett of course protested against term must have insisted upon paying ordinary price might be for service use of mule simply said that be condition on be willing to go with must take leave so have to accept can only hope that may find treasure in case only consented to accept proper payment for service well be awfully good of bertie said though really doe seem fair that must be having service of wife boy mule for nothing there be one thing will be extra inducement to to try put in way of finding one of mine think so bertie said that not for sum of money must do what be going to do simply from gratitude to barnett be curious how tradition superstition like to call of time of inca have continued to impress indian how have preserved secret confided to ancestor doubt fear that spaniard must force to work in mine till died have have great effect in inducing to conceal existence of place from now that spaniard have be cleared out there be longer ground for apprehension of kind may still feel that peruvian must get giant share in mine treasure might be found that indian must under one pretence be defrauded out of share of be not wonderful that must be so considering how poor people have be treated by white must really seem that way in spain have gone to dog be punishment for cruelty in south america island may be said that from very moment when gold began to flow descent of spain commenced in spite of enormous wealth acquired fell gradually from position a greatest power in europe in after battle of pavia spain stood at height of power mexico be conquered by cortez seven year before peru in wealth of country began to flow into spain in enormous quantity yet decline followed speedily be bearded by bucaneers among island on western coast netherlands revolted after fierce fighting threw off yoke battle of ivry accession of henry of navarre destroyed influence in france defeat of armada capture of cadiz struck fatal blow to power on sea to commerce within century of conquest of peru spain be already enfeebled decaying power must almost seem that discovery of columbus from such great thing be hoped proved in long run greatest misfortune that ever befell spain doe look like harry however must hope that effect discovery of america have upon portugal spain will make fortune harry laughed hope so bertie be a well not to be too hopeful still have great faith in dia at rate feel confident that will do can acknowledges that know nothing for certain be sure however that will be faithful guide that though may have rough time will not be unpleasant one now must begin to turn to account what spanish have learned during voyage know have worked regularly at while have not be on duty have learned good lot bertie said dare say must ask for anything must not understand answer can make out lot of spanish don quixote got for when dia be talking to did not catch word of what be saying suppose will come in time must begin at once warn that when be fairly off will always talk to in spanish for must look very unsociable if be always talking together in english if ride walk by side of boy will soon get on there will be donna maria for to chat away with from what saw of must say be sociably inclined in three month have doubt will talk spanish a well a do will be horrid nuisance bertie grumbled suppose have got to be done three day later dia said thought might a well start next day to pachacamac will only want three riding mule one for baggage of course will not take jose wife by time return everything will be ready for will be very glad to be off dia know one here except senor pasquez although have be very civil have begged to consider house a own be of course busy during day one ca do above certain amount of walking about street so by mean let start to morrow morning may a well go time in clothes wear will be time enough to put on thing have bought when start in earnest starting at sunrise rode for distance through fertile valley then crossed sandy plain until reached little valley of lurin in stand ruin of pachacamac be sacred city of native of coast before conquest by inca during forty mile ride dia have told something of place be about to visit pachacamac meaning creator of world be chief divinity of early people here be great temple dedicated to inca after conquest erected vast temple of sun did not attempt to suppress worship of pachacamac two flourished side by side until arrival of spaniard wealth of temple be great spaniard carried away among spoil one thousand six hundred eighty seven pound of gold one thousand six hundred ounce of silver with effort failed to discover main treasure said to have be le than twenty four thousand eight hundred pound of gold have be carried away buried before arrival if spaniard must not succeed in getting at hiding place although doubt tortured everyone connected with temple to make divulge secret be evident there be chance for harry said yes senor made effort thousand of native be employed in driving passage through terrace on temple stood believe that did find much treasure certainly not great one be searching for there be tradition among people a to hiding place for so many of native perished that to whom secret be known must have died without revealing to anybody have not be so spaniard must sooner later have learned for although hundred have died under torture rather than reveal of hiding place surely one more faint hearted than rest must have disclosed certain be that at cuzco other place succeeded in obtaining almost treasure buried there though failed in discovering still greater treasure have be carried away to be hidden in different spot pachacamac be small one in comparison with cuzco be believed that treasure have not be carried far tradition have that be buried somewhere between town lima doubtless concerned in matter fled before spaniard arrived at rate with cruelty invader never discovered position report that be buried near may have be set about to prevent hunting for elsewhere gold may be lying now somewhere in heart of mountain harry prendergast brother looked in astonishment at massive wall rose around eminence on temple have stood latter have disappeared situation must be traced on plateau buttressed by wall be of immense thickness formed of huge adobe brick almost a hard a stone even long effort of spaniard have caused little damage to plateau rose five hundred foot above sea almost washed one face of way up hill four series of massive wall whose top formed terrace stood in giant step fifty foot high here there spot of red paint must be seen showing that whole surface be originally painted ascent be made by winding passage through wall on side of upper area facing sea must be seen remains of sort of walk esplanade with trace of edifice of various kind on hill mile half away be remains of inca temple nunnery style differing materially from of older building be still more damaged than temple on hill by searcher for treasure pachacamac be most sacred spot in south america vast number of pilgrim came here from point city have entirely disappeared covered deeply in sand for long distance round have like neighbourhood of jerusalem mecca be vast cemetery small amount of excavation showed tomb of faithful occupied in most case by mummy will ride across to inca temple there be not much to see there be a well that must look at vault in treasure be hid there be similar place at cuzco several of other ruin may certainly be useful to see harry agreed rode across plain leaving mule outside entered ruin indian led into underground chamber have brought torch with now lit have to be careful might otherwise tumble into one of hole break limb in case if be here by yourselves must certainly never get out again came upon several of place opening be sometimes square sometimes circular have doubtless be covered with square stone be dug out of solid ground for about six foot side of pit be perpendicular in swelled out like great vase with broad shoulder in others became square chamber of size of place be doubt meant to store grain other provision indian said be undoubtedly treasury awkward place to find harry said one might spend lifetime in searching for in only one of temple be last place must think of searching dia said for year spaniard kept thousand of men at work say that there may not be few place have escaped searcher what must not with host of worker find certainly must not be found by four five men be not in temple that inca wealth have be hidden in cave in deep mountain gorge possibly in ruin on other side of mountain where even spaniard never penetrated there be such place know of one to will take if search fails elsewhere be near sea yet there be not dozen living men who have ever seen so strangely be hidden tradition say that be not work of inca of people before have never seen close be guarded say by demon native must go within mile of tradition be that inca when conquered land found place searched after starving out native chief who have fled there with follower family say that found great treasure there others that discovered nothing agree that pestilence carried off nearly who have captured others went too died place be abandoned a accursed in time very existence became forgotten though say that member of tribe have always kept watch there that who carelessly curiously approached have always met with death in strange way although be christian have be taught to disbelieve superstition of countryman must not enter on condition if happen to be near will certainly take close look at harry said with laugh fancy must see anything that rifle pistol must find invulnerable be getting dark by time have finished inspection of room so riding two three mile away encamped in grove up valley next morning returned to lima dia have given out that two white senor intended to visit ruined temple of inca a other traveller have done same intention excited surprise comment on following evening after dark harry brother be returning from house of senor pasquez be pleasant house harry said girl be pretty nice play sing well be really charming what contrast be other morning when went in there accidentally ran against when be going upstairs with father utterly untidy in fact regular slut maid of work must look picture of neatness beside bertie be about to answer when there be outburst of shout from wine shop be passing in moment door burst open dozen men engaged in fierce conflict rushed out knife be flashing be evident that one man be being attacked by rest by light streamed out of open door saw that man attacked be dia flashed across harry mind that if man be killed there be end to hope of success in expedition dash in to rescue bertie cried do mind knife with shout sprang forward struck to ground man who be dodging behind dia with uplifted knife while bertie leapt on to back of shock throwing man down face forward bertie be on foot in moment brought stick carried with force down on man head a tried to rise then springing forward again struck man heavy blow on wrist knife dropped from man hand a dashed with fierce oath upon stick descended again time on head felled to ground in meantime one of assailant have turned fiercely on harry aimed blow at with knife with ease of practised boxer harry stepped back before man must again raise knife leaped in struck tremendous blow on point of chin fifth man took to heel immediately other four lay where have fallen evidently fearing must be stabbed must try to get on to foot be hurt dia harry exclaimed have several cut senor none of think serious have saved life never mind that now dia what will do with fellow hand over to watch senor must be last thing to do might be detained here for month will take knife let go here be two of bertie said picking up of men have struck dia stood over man harry have first knocked down with fierce whisper ordered to give up knife did at once other be still stupid from effect of blow fall dia have only to take knife from relaxed finger now senor let be going before anyone come along what be about dia harry asked a walked away many of muleteer be jealous senor because always get what consider best job have gone into wine shop for glass of pulque before going round to see that mule be all right a be drinking men whispered together then one came up to began to abuse directly answered whole of drew knife rushed at be ready too wounded two of a fought way to door a opened one of stabbed in shoulder be slanting blow once out attacked at once in minute must have have to look for muleteer 't be strange senor that must have saved life a mr barnett did be great deed to risk life with weapon stick against five ruffian with knife did not use stick harry said be more accustomed to use fist than stick can hit a hard with a saw brother stick turned out most useful can box too can not give a heavy blow a can still be very lucky that followed advice bought couple of heavy stick to carry with if must go out after dark now have better come to hotel will send for surgeon to dress wound be not necessary senor wife be waiting for in room arrived afternoon knife cut be not uncommon affair here know quite enough to be able to bandage at rate will have to put off start for few day not at senor bandage tonight few strip of plaster in morning will do business will be stiff for few day will not interfere with riding jose will be able to load unload mule if will give little assistance adios thousand thanks be piece of luck bertie harry said when have reached room in hotel in first place because of got scratch in second because will bind dia more closely to before be willing to assist for barnett sake now will be for own also may be quite sure that will do best for be first scrimmage bertie said must say thought a ran in be going to be pretty serious one have certainly come very well out of be short sharp harry laughed have always held that man who must box well be more than match for one with knife who knew nothing of boxing one straight hit from shoulder be sure to knock out of time next morning dia wife came up early former have one arm in sling a entered woman ran forward throwing arm round bertie kissed on cheek lad be too much surprised at unexpected salute to return a brother did when did same to then drawing back poured out thanks volubly tear running down cheek maria asked if might kiss dia said gravely when stopped said that be right that must do so for do not owe life must not make too much of affair dia four blow be struck there be end to small matter to senor great one to peruvian must not interfere if saw four armed men attacking one must be more likely to turn down next street so that might not be called a witness be only countryman who must do such thing still think that will be ready to start day after to morrow quite sure senor shoulder will be stiff arm in sling for week muleteer think nothing of such trifle kick from mule must be much more serious affair think rascal be likely to waylay on road take revenge not senor if must do such thing unarmed what must not do when have rifle pistol matter be settled have not be seriously hurt if one of have be killed must be obliged to be careful next time came here a be more will be said about except two hurt in wine shop will not even have scar to remind of in two year will have other thing to think about if be true that colombia mean to go to war with chili what be quarrel about colombian helped to get rid of spaniard ever since have presumed right to manage affair here perhaps nothing will come of well be quite certain that there be very good feeling between chili bolivia colombia peru suppose will be fighting round day yes will interfere with business certainly be better off than when spaniard be here tax be heavy thing go a people expected must when got rid of spaniard government seem jealous of other take interest in matter except so far a interfere with trade if man must attend to own affair must be better for suppose so dia one can hardly expect country have be so many year governed by foreign power to get accustomed at once to governing now senor will be glad if will go with look at store be already collected think will find that everything be ready chapter v among mountain two day later mule be brought round to door at sunrise harry brother sallied out from hotel dressed for first time in peruvian costume be warmly clothed on head be felt hat with broad brim must be pulled down tied over ear for warmth to prevent being blown away by fierce wind sweep down gorge thick poncho of llama wool fell from shoulder to knee loosely tied round neck be thick brightly coloured scarf wore high boot carried large knife stuck in strap below knee rifle be fastened at bow of saddle wallet with provision for day be strapped behind by advice of dia have in pocket large pair of green goggles to protect eye from glare of sun snow tied on before coming downstairs agreed that have met unexpectedly in street must have passed other without slightest recognition be pity harry bertie said seriously that did not have portrait taken to send home to certain young lady see must then have be able to hang up in room worship privately without anyone having slightest idea that be absent lover young scamp harry said will pull ear for if attempt anything of sort will tie brim of hat tightly over really think be very ungrateful of not to take advice in spirit in gave if intend to go on like bert will leave behind ca do oh yes can might give in charge for crime other in lack of evidence expenditure of few dollar must have doubt be sufficient to induce judge magistrate call to give six month imprisonment then be unnatural brother will make more suggestion for good so have come downstairs laughing though feeling little shy at appearance a issued out of courtyard speedily however gained courage a saw that passer by paid attention to have spent previous afternoon in packing bundle in item be put away so that must be got at readily in making sure that nothing have be omitted five baggage mule be fastened one behind jose stood at head of leading one a came out dia swung wife on to cushion strapped behind saddle mounted before harry brother climbed into theirs have refused to put on heavy cruel spur worn by peruvian have at earnest request of indian put in saddle bag will want said need not use cruelly must give mule occasional prick to let know that have spur on leaving town road ran up valley of rimac small river of vital importance to country through pass a small canal branching from irrigate land spaniard have done good here at least harry said to dia who be riding beside of canal be constructed in time rest existed long before came here indeed long before inca came inca work lie chiefly beyond mountain on side almost great ruin be of city fortress built by old people cuzco be inca capital almost town between two range of andes be work be true that conquered people down to sea seem to have cared to live here treasure of pachacamac other place on plain be of old people old religion inhabitant of plain be for most part descendant of people inca be strong powerful be not numerous that be why spaniard conquered so easily old people who regarded a master did not care to fight for just a peruvian did not care to fight for spaniard expect be good deal like norman in england bertie put in conquered saxon because be better armed better disciplined be few in number in comparison with number governed in quarrel with other bulk of people stood aloof be only when norman began war in france scotland be obliged to enlist saxon archer soldier that two began to unite to become one people have doubt be so bertie be breaking agreement that must speak in spanish only oh bother know very well that can not talk in yet surely expect that be going to ride along without opening lip know too well to expect harry laughed will allow occasional outbreak still do try to talk spanish however bad may be have got cheek enough in other thing cheek go long way in learning to talk foreign language have be four month at spanish book must certainly begin to put simple sentence together be just what one doe not learn from book lad said at rate not from such book a have be working at must do high flown sentence offer to kiss hand to declare that have be at disposal if wanted to say 'when be going to halt for dinner be feeling very peckish ' must be stumped altogether well must get a near a can bertie dare say can not turn slang into spanish can find other word to express meaning when can not hit on word must use english one best plan be to move along on other side of dia chat to wife what have got to say to anything like can begin by asking if have ever gone long journey with husband before how far will go to day thing of sort well will try anyhow suppose must go on talking to dia else will think that be laughing at five mile from lima passed through little village of quiraz beyond came upon many cotton plantation in ravine by side of valley among ruin of indian town be several large fortress also passed remains of old spanish town several hacienda where many cattle horse be grazing be ascending steadily after passing santa clara eleven mile from lima valley narrowed became little more than ravine on side be rent made in hill by earthquake immense boulder stone be scattered about at bottom of narrow gorge four hour travelling brought to chosica where valley widened again near foot of hill here halted for day there be inn here dia assured be clean comfortable therefore took couple of room for night in preference to unpacking tent be just a well not to begin till get farther away harry said have met number of laden mule coming down if be to camp here must cause general curiosity accordingly ordered dinner for brother dia preferring to take meal in large room used by passing muleteer fare be a good a have have at hotel at lima be not sorry that halted here bertie said feel a stiff a poker think got on very well bertie with mr dia did not hear what be saying seemed to be doing stunningly did most of talking asked to speak slowly a did not manage to catch sense of what said seems full of fun jolly little woman altogether generally understood what meant though must not help laughing sometimes did so good temperedly that one did not feel put out time spoke corrected told what ought to have said made say after think will get on fairly well at end of few week be sure will bertie trouble be only at beginning now that have once broken ice will progress like house on fire there be still four hour of daylight after have finished meal so went out with dia to explore one of numerous burying ground round village consisted of sunken chamber in be bone with remains of mat in body have be clothed wrapping resembled small sack remarked that people must have be of very small size must never have be packed away in with have be buried many of implement of trade one two have apparently not be opened here be knitting utensil toilet article implement for weaving spool of thread needle of bone bronze with body of girl have be placed kind of work box containing article that have used mummy of parrot bead fragment of ornament of silver dia told that tomb be made long before coming of inca said that round head of men boy be wound sling have used in life while piece of cotton flock be wrapped round head of woman many of graf communicated with other by very narrow passage purpose of be not clear probably be made to enable spirit of dead to meet hold communion with other want to see more of bertie said after have spent three hour in investigation sort of thing be enough to give one fit of blue beyond chosica civilization almost ceased road became little more than mule track be in many place almost impassable by vehicle of kind nothing must be wilder than scenery passed at time river ran through perpendicular gorge track wound up down steep ravine sometimes must dismount though dia assured be not necessary still made change from monotonous pace of little over two mile hour at mule breasted steep incline jose rode on first of baggage mule be very lightly loaded generally sang whole time when on foot donna maria stepped gaily along bertie have hard work to keep pace with be making rapid progress with language though occasionally peal of laughter from companion told of egregious error there be village few mile now when halted did so a rule mile before got to one of dinner be cooked over fire of dead stick after meal harry tent be erected bed spread in indian went on to village for night while harry brother sat smoked for time by fire then turned in at daybreak dia rode back leading riding mule baggage animal tent bed cooking utensil be packed up rode in to village passed on at trot until overtook maria jose who have started with other four mule when dia rode away at last reached head of pas two day journey took to oroya standing on elevated plateau ten thousand foot above sea five thousand below highest point of road scenery have now completely changed village be scattered thickly over plain cultivation be general hillside be lined by artificial terrace on be perched chalet small hamlet have seen similar terrace on way up be a spaniard found must at one time have be inhabited by thriving population even now garden orchard flourished upon up to highest point on hill oroya be large place avoiding busy part of town hired room a be necessary to give mule two day rest on first evening after arrival gathered round fire for night be cold even in daytime did not find numerous wrap too hot for now dia harry said must talk over plan said that must not decide upon anything till got here in first place senor think must be well to go to north to see cerro de pasco silver mine say be richest in world be well that must see formation of rock nature of ore may in journeying come across similar rock be gold rather than silver one want to find dia say that silver mine must not be worth very large sum of money must be necessary to open go to large expense to prove then one must have to go to england get up company to work must be long difficult matter still be quite ready to go see place dia nodded what say be true senor must take to dozen place where there be silver may be good may not even if be a rich a potosi silver must have to be carried to lima so great distance on mule back that must swallow up profit must be almost impossible to convey necessary machinery there indeed to do so must involve making of road for great distance at same time dia must know of silver lode that might turn out well must certainly take sample send two three mule load of stuff home might be of good for purpose for have come out here in time might do something with law here be that anyone who find mine can obtain concession for be so senor must proceed to work suppose must be sufficient to put two three men on for purpose if be away for year difficulty might arise must be better for only to determine course of lode thickness value to trace a far a possible then hide sign of work not to make claim until return here very well will take advice dia now about real object of journey have be thinking over deeply dia said first a to mine at present almost gold be obtained be acquired by washing sand of river here there gold have be found in rock not in sufficient quantity to make mining pay river whose sand be richest in gold be in mountain lie behind lake titicaca lie to south of cuzco on border of bolivia one doubt that in time of inca there existed gold mine very rich one for if have not be so be impossible to account for enormous amount of gold obtained by spanish conqueror one doubt that got small portion of gold in existence when arrived be of use whatever for to search old ruin of inca in cuzco other great town can be found there have already be carried away now see senor huanuco jauja cuzco puno lie near eastern range of andes when alarm caused by arrogant conduct of spaniard began be natural that treasure must be sent away into heart of mountain town on western side of plateau challhuanca tanibobamba huancavelica must a naturally send theirs for safety into gorge of western andes tradition point to fact that be not done by inca a soon a spaniard arrived struck first blow great chief must naturally call together band of follower on whose fidelity must rely load treasure on llama of possessed great number hurry off to mountain be among mountain therefore that search must be made tradition point to fact that be along eastern range of cordilleras country beyond by far greater portion of treasure be taken for concealment at rate a have eighteen month for search be on side that must try ten time that length of time must be insufficient for to do thoroughly a to gold mine be certain that lie in portion of range between cuzco lake titicaca be near puno short distance from lake that spaniard owing to folly of indian found great treasure in cave must probably have found much more have not stream suddenly burst out flooded whole valley converted into lake do think have better look for first gold mine hidden treasure of course must depend on dia how much know about matter need not say that hidden treasure must be of vastly more use to than richest gold mine in world to obtain gold from mine abundance of labour be required besides machinery for crushing quartz separating gold from in bed of river if be rich abounding in nugget three four men with rough machinery must wash out large quantity of gold in short time place of sort must be far better than rich mine must not be worked without large amount of capital have heard tale of such place on other side of mountain to south from time to time gold seeker have returned with a much a must carry not one in hundred of go ever come back doubtless die from hunger hardship more be killed by indian most of tribe there be extremely savage be constantly at war with other slay white man who venture into country then be not probable dia that gold must have come from country not from plain from stream running down into although inca never attempted to subdue tribe beyond mountain may have have body of troop to protect worker from incursion by savage be there many wild beast there in part of mountain puma jaguar abound be not altogether satisfactory though must not mind if fell in with one occasionally how about game dia chief game be wild vicuna be very numerous in part be very shy difficult to hunt deer be plentiful there be fox bear hog great article of food be fish on plain manatee be very like seal be caught turtle be found in great number people make oil from egg buffo sort of porpoise also abounds native eat except when very pressed for food catch for sake of oil there be many kind of fish sunaro heard english traveller say be like fish english call pike grow to length of seven eight foot many smaller kind of fish be caught by throwing juice of root of barbasto into small stream make fish stupid float on surface so that may easily be caught by hand there be also many sort of fruit well then ought to do fairly well dia yes senor many of creature be only found in forest in river of plain be so much hunted by savage there that be very shy there be creature with certainly wish to meet unfortunately be not uncommon mean alligator great serpent native fear alligator much for weapon be of avail against must never venture to attack great snake besides what other disagreeables be there dia bertie asked cheerfully there be one other disagreeable dia replied be serious one there be in mountain many desperate men have slain enemy who have friend influential enough to set law in motion against have escaped from prison have resisted tax collector many have be suspected of plotting against government others be too lazy to work how do live harry asked live partly on game partly on plunder steal from cultivator be paid small sum by muleteer passing through mountain rob traveller who be worth robbing sometimes carry off proprietor of land get ransom for occasionally will wash sand get gold enough to send one of number into town to buy article require do go in large band senor a rule ten twelve keep together under one have chosen a chief sometimes if people make complaint troop be sent against will join to resist be not often authority know well enough that have chance of catching men among mountain be so well acquainted with content with stationing few troop in village be through robber savage so few of gold explorer ever return be chiefly think from hardship dia said undoubtedly many who venture down near indian country be killed by who have done well be returning with gold have accumulated fall victim to robber must not of course suppose that there be great number of senor there may be hundred from northern frontier of western cordilleras where maranon cross eastern range down to lake titicaca on one side tacna on other be nigh thousand mile two range cover more square league than can be reckoned even thousand men scattered over must be so many grain of sand on stretch of sea shore certainly sound like dia perhaps worthy people congregate chiefly in neighbourhood of pass be so senor even through traveller might pas many time without being troubled by have fallen in with often dia yes a see have done harm sometimes when get to end of journey mule be not so heavily laden a when started generally people for whom work say to 'here be so many dollar dia be for toll ' there be place in village at foot of most frequented pass where be understood that payment of so many dollar per mule will enable to pas without molestation in return for money receive ribbon rosette feather place in hat a passport may meet few men with gun a pas along when see sign salute civilly ask for drink of wine if be carrying then wish good day be only in little frequented pass that have to take chance may say that though men may plunder never kill muleteer know that if did traffic on road must cease soldier must find guide who knew path hiding place in mountain anyhow think be well dia that took advice handed over gold to senor pasquez for if do into hand of of gentry can lose practically nothing money senor might lose everything else except perhaps mule must not use in mountain if be to take blanket tent provision firearm must be in bad way if happened to be couple of hundred mile in heart of mountain well think will take harry said grimly without paying pretty dearly for with gun rifle old fowling piece got for jose will throw fairly heavy charge of buck shot think can make very good fight against band of eight men even one two more think so dia said gravely be seldom miss mark still hope will not be troubled with with indian see be not so much attack by day that have to fear a surprise at night of course when be once on hill jose will keep watch by turn be a sharp a needle must have fear of of robber creeping up to without hearing ca say so much for in case of indian who can move so noiselessly that even vicuna must not hear until be within spear throw spear be weapon then dia tribe carry bow arrow others only spear sometimes poison point of weapon be unpleasant be there remedy for poison none know of do think savage know of only chance be to pour ammonia at once into hole be made by arrow to cut out flesh round spear wound then to pour in ammonia sear with hot iron account for buying that large bottle of ammonia at lima wondered what wanted for when get into country unpleasant people inhabit will fill spirit flask with so that will always be handy if required now understand thing generally dia only remains for to decide where have best leave plain take to mountain dia be silent for minute must say senor that first have better journey down to cuzco then down to sicuani where western cordilleras after making bend join eastern branch there cross tinta volcano on other side be many gorge in one of know there be very rich gold sand explorer have sought for spot in vain secret have be well kept by few who know have be handed down in father family from father to son ever since spaniard came told to swore to reveal to none son have son secret therefore will die with whether have be passed down in other family can not say may be may not be a owe life also debt of gratitude to senor barnett feel that be more to than son moreover secret be to be kept lest must come to knowledge of spaniard spaniard have gone with reason for concealment so feel now that be justified in taking there be glad of dia assuredly gold can be of service to man a long a lie there must be better to utilize than allow to waste need not say how grateful will feel if can put in way of obtaining can not absolutely promise said have indication will be difficult to find three hundred year bring great change rock on there be mark may be carried away by torrent figure cut in cliff may be overgrown by moss creeper however if few remain hope to be able to find way if fail must try elsewhere be only one of have be told mark know generally several place where great treasure be hidden not mark by must be discovered a may be sure that measure be taken to hide entrance to cave chance must be against lighting upon may say senor great a be treasure of inca of chimoos chincas powerful people who inhabited part of country be fully a large tradition say that most of treasure hidden be not of inca of chimoos who buried when country be invaded by inca be certainly case with most of treasure hidden to west of mountain be so at pachacamac be so at truxillo where spaniard found three million half dollar of gold be known that be small hoard that great one many time larger have never be discovered probably secret have long be lost for if there be few who know where inca buried gold may well be believed that exact locality of chimoo treasure be buried more than eight hundred year ago be now unknown that nothing vague tradition have be handed down one can quite understand harry agreed when consider how many of chimoos must have fallen in struggle with inca how more than population be swept away by spaniard to say nothing of who have died in war of last thirty year seems strange however that treasure in temple of pachacamac be left untouched by inca allowed to accumulate afterwards be so generally regarded a sacred city dia said powerful a be inca did not attempt to interfere with a to do so must certainly have stirred up formidable insurrection of native throughout whole of territory instead therefore of taking possession of temple dedicating to own god allowed to remain untouched worship of old god to be carried on there contenting with building temple of own to sun god close at hand whether treasure find belonged to inca to chimoos be of consequence whatever certainly think that before entering upon what must seem to be almost hopeless search for such store must try place that know of in case seems to dia that if have gone down coast to islay up through arequipa to cuzco journey must have be considerably shorter be true senor must have found difficult to take passage for mule steamer be small craft with poor accommodation even for passenger besides until have made arrangement for journey from lima must hardly say that have made up mind to bring to place only when brother saved life did feel be bound to aid even to point of divulging secret be different now from what be when be first handed down at time spaniard be mercilessly slaying known to be in possession of secret connected with gold discovery of gold entailed forced labour of thousand more of native well senor be changed be own master who find mine be allowed to work on payment of certain royalty there be therefore good in keeping secret have be useless for hundred of year certainly dia will have satisfaction of knowing that be injuring one by act be besides doing very good action to brother well bertie harry said when dia have left room think may congratulate ourselves for first time really think there be chance of expedition turning out success certainly look like bertie agreed for sake hope will be so a for be quite content what with indian brigand wild beast alligator snake journey be likely to be exciting one chapter vi tropical forest took over three week to reach cuzco did not hurry for wished to keep mule in good condition for serious work before be travelling across plateau thickly dotted with village small town everywhere richly cultivated near summit of mountain large flock of alpaca be grazing lower down herd of cattle sheep while near plain be patch of wheat barley potato in turn be succeeded by field of maize apple peach tree prickly pear at foot be field of sugar cane orange citron pine apple cacao many other tropical fruit while in deeper ravine cotton be grown in abundance for want of population here in fact be variety of climate from perpetual snow on summit of lofty mountain to tropical heat in valley if inca have be contented with glorious plateau for century constituted kingdom have passed law against gathering of gold mining for silver might still have be lord here harry said one day there must have be nothing to tempt avarice of spaniard for owing to distance of mine from coast cost of carriage must have be immense long sea journey must have rendered exportation of natural product of country impossible of more sober minded of don might have settled down here taken wife from among daughter of noble bringing with civilization of spain become valuable colonist inca before extended conquest over whole of west of south america must have be comparatively simple people must have have none of habit of luxury magnificence tempted spaniard gold of south america be ruin of inca a be afterwards chief cause of ruin of spain well harry then must very strongly advise to give up treasure hunting to remain poor for curse of gold may not have worked out yet must risk that bertie have desire for luxury magnificence be for laudable purpose seek gold however if have scruple on subject there be occasion for to have share in what may discover think will agree with risk though certainly at present see what advantage amount of money must be to house of peasant be for most part comfortable although small for since expulsion of spaniard people have have reason to make pretence of poverty during spanish rule one dared by size of house by mode of living to show sign of wealth above fellow for to do so must be to expose to cruel exaction of tax collector local official even now have hardly recognized change have taken place remained wedded to habit have become rooted in by century of oppression traveller have difficulty whatever in purchasing food forage on way always slept in tent now preferred donna maria cooking to must obtain in small generally dirty inn in town by time reached cuzco bertie be able to converse in spanish with fluency on way rode beside dia wife with jose in case animated conversation be kept up sometimes on stirring event of war of independence subsequent struggle sometimes about life in way custom concerning maria jose have knowledge bertie also endeavoured to gain information concerning history of peru prior to rising against spain woman boy knew anything of subject beyond fact that inca be great people that native still mourned for see that black apron most of woman wear over one hip a sign of mourning be still worn for inca must have be good people not cruel like spanish must not be so much regretted maria said wear apron because dia be of mixed blood descendant on one side of native on other of creole be of spaniard whose family be settled here who hated countryman just a much a do well there be cuzco in sight have never seen be glad that will stay there for few day old capital of inca lay at end of valley about two mile in length about mile in width to north of city rose abrupt hill crowned by great citadel with three line of wall hill being divided from forming side of valley by two deep ravine in flowed little stream ran through city appearance of town be striking there be numerous church street ran at right angle to other massive stone house dated from early spanish day though be surmounted for most part by modern brickwork addition where great temple of sun once stood church of santo domingo have be built portion of splendid building of old faith being incorporated in be use of staying here bertie asked brother impatiently two day after have arrived at cuzco dare say old ruin fortress so on be very interesting to people who understand about inca a know nothing about see how can expect to get up interest in old wall because tell that be one of remains of palace belonging to old chap never heard of will be very glad when dia say that mule have have enough rest that can set out on business be afraid be goth bert harry said looking at with expression of pity here be in one of most interesting city of world place thousand thousand of people must travel distance to investigate in forty eight hour be tired of have romance in nature respect for past be goth philistine be afraid be mixing up locality harry may be goth philistine perhaps be not aware that people tribe have connection with other education in matter unconnected with royal navy seems to have be even more deplorably neglected than own shut up youngster lieutenant prendergast be not on quarter deck of one of majesty ship at present be not even leader of small caravan on march be in locanda on term of perfect equality save except in small advantage that may posse in matter of year harry laughed well bertie altogether disagree with what say if have come here to get up history of inca investigate ruin of palace must be content to stay here for week a be be really just a anxious a be to be on move be speaking to dia hour ago say that in two more day will be able to start again have be discussing how much flour other thing be absolutely necessary to take of course better provided be more comfortable will be on other hand a dia say be of great importance that mule must carry a little weight a possible in crossing pass will have benefit of old road of inca once leave difficulty will be enormous dia said that might be better to dispose of mule altogether get trained llama in place a can climb over rock where mule must obtain foothold then must be necessary to take with one two native accustomed to way must not suit at however do think that must be worth while to take two three of animal with can carry hundred pound apiece a may be going over extraordinarily rough country fifty pound must be sufficient advantage must be that must establish sort of central camp at farthest spot to mule must go then make exploring expedition with llama to carry provision tool llama be not bad eating so that if found other use for must assist commissariat how far can go in day harry ten twelve mile may be sure that be a much a can do when be among mountain then must think must be very useful suppose there will be difficulty in buying none at good many be brought in for sale to market day of course must be necessary to get strong animal accustomed to burden before starting there be long consultation between harry dia a to course must be better to adopt most frequented pas through mountain be that to paucartambo forty mile north east from cuzco at mouth of pas lead down into plain between town carabaya range hundred fifty mile to south be to be found rich gold deposit to dia have referred so far however a tradition have received informed be situated near slope of tinta volcano between ayapata direct road to spot be extremely difficult be of opinion that journey must be more easily performed by going to paucartambo then skirting foot of mountain will find difficulty in obtaining food a go along said wild turkey pheasant other bird be to be met with in district moreover there be many plantation have be deserted owing to depredation of chincas tribe who live on tributary of pueros a used to be called rio madre de dios here will find field of maize still growing sugar cane cacao rice one after estate have be abandoned at of whole of people on farm be massacred in danger be so great that proprietor found impossible to work one drawback to road be that may fall in with chincas in case will certainly attack however be widely scattered through forest may not fall in with on other hand track by tinta mountain from sicuani be extremely difficult dangerous might lose several of animal in traversing must have to depend entirely on what carried for food then by mean let go other way dia be to lose of mule must be impossible to replace must be useless to find gold if must not carry away two day later started four llama having be added to caravan dia explained that must not be necessary to take native to attend to animal a once started must follow mule without difficulty especially if be fed with before starting three day travelling brought to little town lay very high up in hill cold here be bitter party needed wrap be glad to get in motion a soon a be light passing over range of mountain above paucartambo where thin layer of snow crunched under foot began tremendous descent into plain in short time morning mist cleared away road led through tropical forest took over three hour to reach river chirimayu descent of eleven thousand foot in course of eight mile here halted by side of splendid waterfall hill rose up perpendicularly on side except where little river made way through gorge be covered with brushwood fern creeper thick with flower of many colour while lofty palm forest tree grew wherever root must find hold splendid butterfly of immense size flitted about bird of many kind beautiful plumage flew hither thither among tree humming bird sucked honey from bright flower parrot chattered screamed in upper branch of tree foam spray of torrent sparkled in sun harry brother stood struck with admiration at loveliness of scene even donna maria jose ceased chatter a looked at scene such a have never before witnessed be worth coming way from england to see bertie be indeed if be like sha' mind how long dia take to find place be in search of at word from dia set to work to take burden off animal place be cleared for tent when have be erected jose collected dried stick fire be soon lighted maria began to prepare breakfast be unhealthy here dia not here senor be still many hundred foot above plain in forest there be unhealthy for white tree grow so thickly that be difficult to penetrate swamp morass lie in many place air be thick heavy will not go down there until need when must descend will find abundance of maize fruit of sort savage kill people find on estate destroy crop devastate field be wise enough to know that be useful to though be too lazy to work appreciate good thing that others have planted be rather early to make halt dia have work to do senor in first place must find spot where large tree stand on bank of torrent two three of must be felled so that fall across then will have to chop off branch lay flat side by side make bridge over to take animal after breakfast must set about work will be too late before finish to think of going farther to day be well that bought four good ax plenty of rope at cuzco harry said will want very often senor three large torrent come down between tinta volcano besides many smaller one rise from hill to north of fall into others eventually combine to make madre de dios so far a be known boat can descend river to amazon without meeting with obstacle from point only few mile from head of pueros will presently cross fact that there be cataract during whole course from hill to junction of river show how perfectly flat great plain be did inca spaniard ever conquer chincas cultivate splendid plain inca drove back distance senor forced to pay tribute never conquered doubtless cultivated land for league from foot of mountain a did spaniard be considered most fertile part of montana a possession side of cordilleras be called spaniard tried to push farther met with such stout opposition by savage that be forced to desist be ready when maria announced breakfast after meal sat smoking for hour reluctant to commence heavy work before have better be moving senor dia said a rose to foot will not get bridge made before dark hundred yard from camp found three large tree growing close to other near edge of stream bertie looked at with air of disgust will be worse for hand than rowing for twelve hour in heavy boat dare say will harry agreed have got to be done sooner set about better will take off flannel shirt bertie said have better not senor dia said a saw what lad be about to do there be many insect here will sting bite of of swell up turn into sore now senor will take tree next be not quite so large will take will help when be finished with own brother jose can work by turn at other be hard work for tree be over two foot across near foot dia have felled before others have cut half way through then lent aid to harry who be streaming with perspiration be not accustomed to senor will manage better when have have two three month practice at work did not bargain for harry bertie said a rested for twentieth time from work jaguar alligator indian bandit hard climbing be prepared for certainly never expected that must have to turn into wood cutter be hard work bertie be useless to grumble a dia say will become accustomed to in two three month two three month bertie repeated with groan hand be regularly blistered already arm back ache dreadfully well fire away why jose have done twice a much a have have hardly turned hair suppose that have have much more practice than have have be nothing like so strong oh dare say if have never cut ancestor have suppose be hereditary anyhow have be doing best well here go harry laughed at brother theory for explaining why jose have done more work than have be by mean sorry that dia have come to assistance that tree be nearly ready to fall jose climbed with end of long rope secured to upper bough dia then took other end of rope crossed torrent by tree have felled when jose have come down harry have given few more cut with axe be able to guide tree in fall almost directly across stream then took bertie tree in hand in ten minute be lying beside others took three hour more work to cut off branch to lay tree side by side be done with aid of one of mule smaller log be packed in between to make level road when be done worker went back to little camp sun be already setting donna maria have cooking pot simmering over fire have be hard day work harry said when brother threw down on grass near fire hard be name for harry have never be sentenced to work on tread mill must cheerfully chance for month rather than do day work like palm of hand feel a if have be handling red hot iron arm shoulder ache a if have be on rack seem to be in pain from tip of toe to top of head harry laughed be only what settler who build hut in backwoods must feel bert be work of wood cutter charcoal burner be good deal like work of miner have be brought up too soft boy soft be hanged lad said indignantly be first time have heard that life of apprentice on board ship be soft one have doubt feel just a bad a do hear grumbling bert be difference expect that of two be rather worse for bone muscle be more set than yours be year now since pulled at rope oar bertie be silent for minute two then said rather apologetically well harry perhaps need not have grumbled so much see be pretty rough beginning when one be not accustomed to ought to have have short job to begin with got into gradually instead of having six hour on end expect that backwoods settler be talking about doe not work for very long when first begin if did must be fool for certainly must not be fit for work for week if kept on till have nearly broken back taken whole skin off hand by working day first time tried there be something in bertie a be in extraordinary hurry do think might have be satisfied with felling tree to day cutting off branch getting into place to morrow still a dia seemed to make nothing of did not like to knock off at very start meal be ready senor maria said think have better eat at once for sky look a if be going to have rain thunder too dia said have better begin jose will picket mule hobble llama if be to make off must have lot of trouble in morning aspect of sky have indeed changed mass of cloud hung on top of hill scud be flying overhead maria placed one of cooking pot two tin plate knife fork beside harry brother with two flat cake of ground maize sit down have food at once harry said to rain will be down in bucketful before many minute be soon joined by dia jose latter bringing up large can of water from stream have just finished when large drop of rain began to patter on ground never mind thing harry said a leapt to foot crawl under shelter at once be use getting wetting at once made for tent be just in time for rain began to fall in torrent peal of thunder crashed out overhead a got under canvas be first experience of sort of thing harry said a brother lit pipe half sitting half reclining on bed rather wondered why dia put tent on little bit of rising ground did not look so soft tempting a level see now that acted very wisely for must have be flooded in time if have be lower down a be be by mean sure that sha have water in time will take precaution to make trench round tent when pitch however have got waterproof sheet underneath bed so expect will be right hope so anyhow have better see that edge be turned up round so that water can not run over by jove doe come down can hardly hear other speak suddenly entrance to tent be thrust aside here be candle senor be thrown in dia ran back into own tent be few yard away before harry must remonstrate at coming out candle will be useful anyhow bertie said be almost pitch dark now what with sun going down cloud overhead have turned from day into night in past five minute striking match lit candle stuck in between shoe took off for purpose be more cheerful harry hullo what be that deep sound be certainly not thunder rose from wood be answered again again from different direction must be puma jaguar be always called here lion tiger have doubt dia will know by roar be must not mind if be daylight for be not pleasant to know that there be at least dozen of beast in neighbourhood may a well drop cartridge into rifle pistol believe of beast often attack men might certainly attack mule storm continued clap of thunder be succeeded by roar snarl hissing with strange cry shriek during momentary lull harry shouted be there fear of beast attacking mule dia senor be too frightened by thunder lightning to think of doing so what be cry hear be monkey senor be frightened by storm by roaring of lion tiger be bigger harry puma jaguar believe jaguar be bigger puma be more formidable fiercer latter belongs to same family a lion former to of leopard jaguar be more heavily built than leopard stronger with shorter leg be spotted just a leopard be puma be in build like lion have mane prey on animal of kind native say catch turtle turn over on back a man must do tear shell apart will also eat fish be scourge to indian white planter a will kill sheep horse cattle of course if be attacked by men wounded will fight desperately a most wild creature will if man doe not molest be quite content to leave alone unless chance to pas under tree among branch of be lying in wait for prey of can climb tree well thought must have slept like log harry after work have done what with thunder patter of rain noise of beast think be likely to close eye will get accustomed to noise after time bert at present feel a if be in middle of travelling menagerie have be caught in thunderstorm be curious that animal must be frightened at lightning for can not know that be really dangerous yes know have two dog on last ship be in clap of thunder must send flying down companion into cabin must crouch in dark corner in state of absolute terror must do just same if cannon be fired in salute anything of sort suppose thought be thunder in spite however of noise harry brother dropped off to sleep before long being thoroughly worn out by day work be awakened by dia opening front of little tent sun be up senor be fine morning after storm maria have got coffee ready baked cake fried slice of meat right dia will be out directly will first run up bank short distance have dip wo be able to swim senor bed of torrent be full swimmer must breast water all right will be careful throwing on poncho went down to stream ran along bank water be coming down like race horse bert just ahead have overflowed bank can have bath there safely though be not deep enough for swimming after ten minute absence returned to camp completed dressing sat down to breakfast what be frightful noise dia be puma jaguar be senor can easily tell difference in sound make jaguar be between roar snarl while puma be sort of hissing roar a soon a breakfast be over tent be packed up mule llama laden dia have given feed round hour before course must take have be already agreed upon must descend to plain for must be next to impossible to cross ravine on mountain side stream coming down from hill dia said must be followed nearly up to source for next seventy eighty mile search need not be so careful a must be afterwards place can not be far from tinta somewhere side of need not hurry for there be two month to spare how do mean dia on day answer to st of march coyllur be star will rise at midnight in cleft in peak can be seen only in valley in stream contains gold run down be what father taught therefore there must be mountain to south east can only be where cordilleras run east be case at tinta be excellent a far a go if happen to be in right valley at time dia must not help in slightest if be in other valley must have to wait year before trying in place yes senor there be mark on rock of particular kind there be mark on rock in other valley so that must not be distinguished by spaniard searching for place must know mark when saw then in case dia star must not be of much use to know not how might be senor a instruction have be handed down from time when spaniard arrived must surely in way be useful in what way can not say at rate dia what with mark speak of star will be hard if can not find suppose be sure that place be rich if do light upon of that there can be doubt senor tradition say that be richest spot in mountain be only worked when king have need of gold either for equipping army on special occasion at time must be worked for one month then closed until gold be again required however a go way will explore other valley gold be found more le in of possibly may find rich spot can fall back upon if fail in search hardly see how can fail with star mark on rock to aid mark may have disappeared senor in case may not be in right spot when star rise again inca may have closed approach in way to make matter sure can not promise that will find gold will do best with knowledge have come down to if fail must try in other direction when spaniard came forty thousand of inca people left cuzco neighbouring town journeyed away down mountain out to west since then reliable news concerning have be heard rumour have from time to time come from direction to effect that there be great wealthy city there say not that if failed here must attempt to find danger from savage must be too great there must be great forest to traverse many river to be crossed might travel for year without ever finding city when got there might be seized put to death if be spared might not be able to make off with treasure mention to show that gold may be found in many other place besides valley be seeking quite agree with dia that unless must get indication of position of city if now exists must be madness to attempt to search for want gold badly propose that must throw away life in what must be almost hopeless adventure even if be ready to risk own life on mad enterprise must not ask others to do same crossing stream made way down through forest be toilsome work a often have to clear way with ax through undergrowth tangle of creeper at noon reached level ground heat be now intense even under tree air close oppressive on way down harry shot wild turkey when halted be cut up broiled over fire after have be eaten lay down slept for two three hour ought not to set guard harry have asked no senor think necessary jose will lie down by side of llama even if mule must not give warning of man beast approaching llama will do so be shyest most timid of creature must detect slightest movement for next three week continued way during time five six ravine be investigated a far a must be ascended sample be frequently taken from sand gravel washed though particle of gold be frequently found be not in sufficient quantity to promise good result from washing if have band of native with dia said must doubt get enough to pay well be to say to cover expense leave ounce two of profit to eight ten men engaged a matter stand must only be wasting time by remaining here have difficulty in obtaining sufficient food turkey pheasant be occasionally shot tapir be once killed a have brought hook line with fish be frequently caught in stream be of small size very good eating a dia said must not hope to find larger specie except far out in plain where river be deep sluggish work be hard be now accustomed to often have to go considerable distance before must find tree available for bridging torrent on other hand sometimes came upon of much smaller girth than have first tackled labour in getting down be comparatively slight sometimes stood little way from stream after be felled two mule must easily drag to site of bridge when on march harry brother carried double barrelled gun with one barrel charged with shot suitable for pheasant other bird other with buck shot dia carried rifle very seldom did mount mule ground being so rough broken bough of tree so thick that be le trouble to walk at head of animal than to ride chapter vii indian attack one day when returned from exploring valley harry brother taking rifle strolled down open glade while dia jose unpacked animal have gone hundred yard when heard sound be new to sounded like grunting of number of pig dia be attending to mule harry bertie caught up gun presently small pig made appearance from among tree harry be on point of raising gun to shoulder when dia shouted stop shoot what be matter dia asked in surprise a latter ran up be peccary well be sort of pig be yes senor if be to kill might all be torn in piece travel through forest in great herd if one be injured wounded rest will rush upon assailant may shoot down dozen of that only redoubles fury only hope of escape be to climb tree will keep watch there regardless of how many be shot until hunger obliges to retire be bravest beast of forest will attack kill even lion tiger if have seized one of number beg to stroll back quietly then sit down will go to head of mule if herd see that pay attention to may go on without interfering with if see approaching evidently intending to attack must take to tree try to keep from attacking mule there must be small chance of succeeding in doing so jose at once went up to mule stood perfectly quiet at head harry bertie moved closely up laid double barrelled gun beside then sat down by time forty fifty of peccary have issued from tree be rooting among herbage others stood perfectly quiet staring at group on rise above seeing movement among sign of hostility joined others in search for food in quarter of hour whole herd have moved off along edge of forest praise be to saint dia said taking off hat crossing have escaped great danger hunter must rather meet couple of lion tiger than herd of peccary little animal be always ready to give battle once begin fight till die more be killed more furious do others become even in tree there be safety many hunter have be besieged in tree until overpowered by thirst fell to ground be torn to piece what do eat harry asked will eat anything kill chief food be root kill great number of snake even largest python be match for herd of peccary if catch before can take refuge in tree well then be very lucky that stopped before fired fortunate indeed senor by taking to tree might have saved life must certainly have lost mule puma tiger kill little beast when come across straggler be well that do for otherwise wood must be full of though fortunately multiply a fast a pig having only two three in litter be good eating be seldom that hunter can shoot one for if only wound shriek will call together companion within mile round then must give up idea of having pork while be among mountain now be going to keep here day dia maria called suddenly seems to that have forgotten altogether harry bertie must not help laughing dia have on returning to mule taken wife seated on branch six foot from ground in order must peccary attack might be ready at once to snatch up rifle join in fight without having first to think of safety of wife now lifted down action did even more than what dia have said to convince harry of seriousness of danger to have be exposed for a rule donna maria have scoffed at offer of aid even in most difficult place with light springy step have taxed power of others to keep up with offer have not come from dia who showed confidence in wife power by paying attention whatever grim smile have often played on lip when harry brother have offered hand that first thought have be of now showed that considered crisis serious one thought dia have gone mad said a regained foot must not think what be matter when began to shout ran towards saw nothing little pig then when came slowly back with suddenly seized jerked up on to bough felt quite sure of especially when told to hold tongue not say word be that little pig saw lot more of afterwards yes if have taken into head to come way must have seen good deal more of than must be pleasant dia said with rifle must have faced four lion tiger with better hope of success than little pig saw be peccary sort of wild pig most savage little beast in forest must have chased up into tree killed mule who must have thought said why when be girl have often gone in among herd of little pig quite a big a thing never felt least afraid of must have be braver than thought be be good deal sillier than think be maria dia said shortly there be a much difference between pig peccary a there be between quiet indian cultivator on sierra one of savage indian of wood suppose can light fire now dia there be fear of creature coming back again be there must think not fortunately be going in opposite direction otherwise must have said that have better stop here for day two in case must attack if came upon again next day a be journeying through forest at foot of slope jose gave sudden exclamation what be dia asked saw naked indian standing in front of tree have gone now be sure jose quite sure be standing perfectly still looking at when called to must have slipped round tree only took eye off for moment when looked again be gone then be in for trouble dia said gravely of course be one of chincas doubt be alone may be sure that have made off to tell companion have seen will know exactly how many be how many animal have may be twenty four hour may be three four day before make appearance again be certain that sooner later will hear of hunter a be can follow track where must see nothing so crafty be that can traverse country without leaving slightest sign of passage forest might be full of yet keenest white hunter must see footprint other mark must indicate presence what have better do dia will probably come to stream before senor will follow up until get to ravine bare of tree there can fight in forest must have chance must lie in ambush for climb into tree hide among foliage first must know of presence must be shower of arrow a be excellent marksman must probably be riddled at first volley there can be sauntering now must push animal forward at best speed will lead way do senor bring up rear urge mule forward will try pick ground where tree be thinnest mule can then go at trot can not do so here for must always be knocking load off be evening before arrived at stream here made short halt while gave double handful of grain to of animal then pushed on again until be too dark to go farther will be safe to light fire dia yes will make difference be not likely to attack at night savage seldom travel after dark partly because be afraid of demon partly because must be liable to be pounced upon by wild beast think there be chance of overtaking until tomorrow man jose saw may have have companion close at hand will know that be well armed will hing until have gathered large number feel sure that can overpower will probably take up track to morrow at daylight have made long march can calculate that will find defensible position before overtake jose will keep watch to night will take turn with dia senor ear be accustomed to sound of forest yours be not if be watching must still have sleep night passed without alarm hour before daylight dia gave animal good feed of corn a soon a be light again started be already distance up mountain after eight hour travelling arrived at gorge suited purpose for two hundred yard rock rose perpendicularly on side of stream be thirty foot wide rain have fallen for day water be willow enough at foot of cliff for mule to make way among fallen rock through rushed impetuously at upper end cliff widened out into basin fifty yard across can not do better than halt here dia said in two three hour can form strong breast work on rock nearly out to middle of stream where current be too swift for anyone to make way up against be likely to besiege long dia can not say think will give up easily savage learn to be patient when roaming forest in search of game time be of value to besides be sure to lose many if attack will therefore try to get revenge may have to give up from want of food dia shook head there be sure to be plenty of fish in river will poison pool get abundance with bow arrow can bring down monkey from tree can snare small animal however senor can talk over thing to morrow have best begin breast work at once while maria be cooking dinner need badly enough for have have nothing maize cake ate before starting working hard till be dark piled up rock stone till formed breast work four foot high on side twelve foot in centre be open have chosen spot where so many fallen rock lay in stream that needed comparatively little labour to fill up gap between thought wood chopping bad enough bertie said a threw down on ground after completing labour be joke to back be fairly broken arm feel a if be pulled out of socket hand be cut have nearly squeezed two nail off have be hard work harry agreed still have made ourselves fairly safe will get wall couple of foot higher in morning will only want to add to on lower face in order to form sort of parapet will shelter a lie down to fire so wo be anything like such hard work then will fill in rock behind with small stone sand to lie down upon will never be able to fight way up to dia said need have fear on score question be can get down into valley behind rock look very steep in most place almost perpendicular be steep senor tree grow on in many place savage be like monkey will have to examine very carefully when have finished wall if find that be possible for anyone to get down must go up next gorge see if can find better position suppose think be safe for to night dia think will try to come up through stream have keen eye must be so dark down there that even cat must not see will guess that have stopped here will certainly want to find out position before attack one two may come up a scout in case may attack at daybreak of course two of will keep watch can change three hour will take first watch with brother jose can take next jose have better sleep maria put in watched last night eye be a good a will watch with don harry harry must have protested dia said quietly will be well maria will have to keep tongue quiet savage have ear like of wild animal if be to raise voice might get arrow in brain can be silent when like dia be possible dia said dryly remember in year have be married have known like to do so take that a compliment said quietly for show at least that be never sulky well don harry do accept a fellow watcher certainly will be very glad to have with think that need be forbidden to talk in low tone for roar of water among rock must prevent sound of voice from being heard two three yard away accordingly a soon a became dark dia went to wall with bertie jose after last look at mule wrapped in blanket lay down think have better turn in to tent harry said have have two day hard work building of wall have pretty nearly finished so if get two three hour sleep to night be afraid will not be very useful sentinel five minute later be sound asleep when brother roused must hardly believe that be time for to go on duty dia be waiting there will come down latter said be sleeping like top have to pull at leg three time before woke be coming harry said a crawled out feel more sleepy than when lay down will just run down to stream sluice head will wake up in earnest for water be almost a cold a ice when came back be joined by donna maria taking shot gun rifle went forward with to barricade so have seen heard anything dia nothing senor have have good sleep dia will watch for next four hour be eleven o'clock now so will be able at three to take on till daylight will send call again hour before dia said if attack a expect will a soon a dawn break have better have whole force ready to meet so saying dia went off be scarcely woman work donna maria be woman work to help defend life senor a long a can if found that savage be beating must stab must kill might carry away with must be thousand time worse than death think there be fear of beating harry said certainly not here ought properly to be one on side really shirk thought of wading through river waist deep at willow place found hundred yard up must be bad enough to go through worse still to lie for four hour in wet clothes besides must not talk then senor maria said with little laugh must be very dull very dull even now must only talk occasionally will have to keep eye ear open think of will be much good said can see white water nothing else be sure must not hear naked footstep on rock be good thing water be white because can make out rock rise above surface when eye get quite accustomed to dark must certainly be able to see figure stepping upon wading in water must see now senor think will be of advantage to talk for be sure if be to lie with eye straining thinking of nothing else must soon begin to close talking occasionally in low tone keeping up vigilant watch be altogether hidden from view of anyone coming up stream for exposed only eye top of head above rough parapet attempt have be made to fill up space between stone so except for rounded shape must be next to impossible to make out between rough rock of crest harry have laid double barrelled gun on parapet in front of have loaded barrel with buck shot feeling in darkness be far more likely to do execution with weapon than with rifle have be two hour on watch when donna maria touched arm significantly gazed earnestly must see nothing minute later however rock about fifteen yard away seemed to change shape before have be pointed just on one side of top there be now bulge do see maria whispered can make out one above rock other be standing against wall illustration indian spy expedition there be movement for two three minute harry have doubt that be examining two black line of stone between water be rushing there be two others on side senor maria whispered pause be broken by sharp tap of two arrow striking on stone few inch below head well have begun harry muttered have already sighted gun at head half hidden by rock now pulled trigger then turning fired other barrel aiming along side of canyon where two men seen by companion must be standing head disappeared loud cry broke from other side stillness have reigned in valley be broken by chorus of shriek roar air overhead thrilled with sound of innumerable wing harry on firing have laid down fowling piece snatched up rifle do see others two have run away one against rock on other side be wounded for saw throw up arm be who screamed man by dropped where stood one behind rock be killed saw body carried away in white water half minute later dia bertie came up so have come senor yes there be four of wife saw though must only make out one shot two arrow at answered man saw be killed donna maria said that one on other side also fell be wounded that be good beginning dia said after such lesson will attempt nothing more to night doubt whether will come down in morning can get sight of barricade from bend hundred yard down think will dare come up when see how ready be for well will work out watch anyhow dia now that see how sharp donna maria eye be have not least fear of being surprised will stop with bertie said will have chance of going off to sleep again after being wakened up like if be going to stop bertie have better go back fetch blanket be chilly here then if like can doze off again till watch come there be fear of harry have be eight forty hour on deck more than once will warrant not to go to sleep in spite of however in le than ten minute after return bertie regular breathing showed that be sound asleep harry maria continued watch longer with same intentness a before be sure that dia must not have lain down unless felt perfectly certain that chincas must make fresh move until morning chatted gaily until at two o'clock dia came up everything be quiet here dia brother be fast asleep will wake now that have come up do so senor worked very hard building wall today if see anything suspicious will rouse may have work tomorrow be much better that must sleep on thank dia fatigue have told on more than on figure be not set yet feel more walked back to tent with maria if wake just a daylight break please rouse said will wake senor generally get up at daybreak be best time for work down in plain generally contrive to get everything done before breakfast at seven harry slept soundly until be called sky be just beginning to get light senor turned out at once jose be already feeding mule have better come along with jose bring gun of yours with if savage do attack will be well to make forcible impression on greatly pleased with permission jose took up old musket carried accompanied harry what have got in gun jose charge of buck shot that gave other day senor right fire unless get close shot will not carry far like bullet if fired when be close be better than bullet for might hit dozen of at once jose have be allowed to practise at halting place though must not be called good shot must shoot well enough to do good execution at thirty forty yard bertie be still asleep everything quiet dia have seen nothing moving since came out now bertie harry said stirring brother up with foot hand on deck bertie sat up opened eye what be up now said ay what be harry jose too must have be asleep be asleep why went off in middle of watch dia have be on look out for over three hour oh confound mean to say have slept for over five hour why did wake dia asked angrily two eye be quite enough to keep watch dia said must have waked if have seen anything of savage besides don harry said might a well go on sleeping if nothing happened thought so too feel beastly ashamed of bertie said want to be treated like child harry bertie must not think of treating so have have very hard work be completely knocked up be not wonderful may want strength to day besides know must have be of use have be awake for must have seen nothing donna maria eye be good deal sharper than mine be quite sure tired a be dia must have seen coming long before must have better lie down again for will be light enough soon for to make out how far do arrow fly dia can shoot very straight up to forty fifty yard beyond arrow be of very little use well then will be able to stop before get to ravine presently a became light figure showed at turn of ravine fire at harry said be better that must think that gun wo reach besides if beggar will leave alone have wish to harm in minute two figure disappeared behind bend two three others came out think that gun wo carry so far must have shot first man for quarter of hour there be frequent change until at least fifty men have taken look at now there will be council harry said a last disappeared see what have got before have doubt like think will try senor dia said at rate will not do so until have tried other mean of getting at hour passed then harry said will stop here with brother dia jose have better examine hillside ascertain whether there be place where can come down know great deal better than where active naked footed men must clamber down might be able to descend with ease at place must look quite impossible to without word dia shouldered rifle walked away followed by jose returned in two hour there be several place where be sure savage must come down now senor breakfast be ready will leave jose here will go talk matter over while eat tent be only hundred yard away so that if jose shout can be back here long before savage get up for must not come fast through torrent seems to harry said after have finished meal that if there be only one two point by must climb down must prevent doing so by picking off if there be more really come on in earnest must not stop there be many more than dia replied made out certainly four point on right hand side three on left where must make way down there be probably twice a many where must descend then must say that first thing to do be to go up through gorge above see whether there be place must be better defended than if find such spot of course must move to if not will have to settle whether to go up gorge till get to place where mule can climb out of stay here fight out by camping on stream at point where must not be forded making breast work with bale stone so on think must certainly beat off attack by daylight admit that must have chance if must make rush during night will go at once said dia examine river higher up if can find place where mule can climb be sure to be able to find spot where must do so must mean failure of expedition for certainly must not go up mountain purchase fresh animal food tool get down to place be looking for until too late must be serious dia can not be counted against life if there be other way of escape from savage must certainly abandon animal make way back a best can in case must give up idea of finding gold stream star must not be in same place again for year even then might not find so must make up mind to do best in other direction that point must consider a settled must not feel justified in risking brother life yours wife nephew by remaining here to fight know not how many savage for there may be many more than fifty saw morning may in day two be joined by many others of tribe must not like to lose animal go back empty handed dia said after silence of two three minute unless be last resource must dia see if linger too long may find impossible to retire may be so hemmed in there must be chance of getting through for day of course be safe savage will have to decide among whether to give matter up seeing that be sure to lose many life before overpower then if determine to attack will have to settle how be to be done number of will go up to top of hill on side try to find point at can make way down others perhaps must be still more serious may go farther up into hill to find spot where must come down issue out by upper gorge then retreat must be altogether cut off will take time so may feel sure that attack will be made to day will start up river at once senor certainly first point to be settled be whether can find more defensible spot than second whether there be way by animal can be taken up there must surely be many point higher up where can be done yes senor if must get to saw have difficulty in making way through gorge there may be others higher up where must be impossible for animal to pas did not think of yes must be so well have certainly better go at once brother will relieve jose after boy have breakfasted can return to post bertie can join think if see savage trying to find path will open fire upon say must be able to hit for top of hill must be eight nine hundred yard range be not easy to hit object very much above very much below be important that must know that weapon carry a far a when hear bullet strike close to will hesitate about coming lower down unless do come within two three hundred foot from bottom can not be sure of getting down dia nodded be very good idea cause of delay will be that at top can not see far down rock on own side so will have to start by guess work party must fix upon easiest place on opposite side then go back again change side suppose know more of place than do always keep down in plain be only because met down there that have followed so far believe will follow on a long a think there be chance of destroying for be so jealous of white man coming into what regard a country that must spare pain to kill anyone who ventured there now will go senor will keep near end of valley in case there must be alarm that be coming up stream certainly brother will remain with jose with rifle two double barrelled gun jose musket must hold ravine against anything rush of whole tribe hour later harry saw number of figure appear against sky line on side a be clustered together must afford far better mark than single indian took steady aim at party on southern hill fired have aimed above rather than below a have ball struck much below might not hear whereas if went over head must certainly do so couple of second after firing saw sudden movement among savage moment later not one be to be seen donna maria who be standing close by watching clapped hand ball must have gone close to said think hit anyone did not try to do so said wanted ball to go just over head so that must know that even at distance be not safe have doubt astonishment a much a fear made bolt will be very careful how far come down side of hill after now for fellow on other side too have disappeared having evidently noticed effect produced upon others after pause head appeared here there at edge of crest evidently lesson have impressed with necessity for precaution a no longer kept together have apparently crawled up to continue investigation beyond keeping watch to see that none have attempted to descend slope harry did not interfere with at time strolled to breast work movement have be seen in direction in two hour dia returned gorge above be quarter of mile through very difficult to pas be half blocked with great rock in two three place there must be immense difficulty in getting mule over beyond that widens again extent be not more than what be here wall be almost perpendicular think that must be possible to climb at point farther up there be ravine be very narrow not so wide a stream rush with great velocity along two hundred yard from entrance rock close in completely there be fall of water sixty seventy foot high well that settle point dia can not get animal out except by way came in a for ourselves might climb up at point in ravine not in others be so senor dia said outlook be bad one be to say may now be unable to reach gold river in time so long a stay here may be safe have plenty of provision can catch fish in stream doubt will find bird in bush at lower part of slope doubt whether native will dare come down precipice at night if try to descend by day can very well defend only question be how long will take to tire out that can not tell know so little of chincas that have nothing to go upon savage have patience enough to wait for time to carry out revenge slay enemy others be fickle though may be fierce in attack soon tire of waiting be eager to return to home again can not think that will speedily leave have assembled many of perhaps from considerable distance have have two day march up here have lost at least two of comrade think will certainly not leave until absolutely convinced that can not get at whether may come to decision in two day month can not say chapter viii defeat of native bertie who have joined harry when saw dia approaching have listened silently to talk then said think that by loading mule moving towards mouth of next gorge just a be getting dark might induce chincas to think that be going that way so to follow along top of hill might a soon a night have fallen come back again go down stream of course there may be of left to watch mouth of ravine must drive off easily enough get long start before fellow on hill know what have happened none of others spoke immediately then harry said idea be good one a far a go see at present be in very strong position if leave overtake in wood will not have advantage that have here yes see that harry almost anything be better than having to wait here lose chance of finding that gold ca help bertie know how much that gold must be to a said morning will run desperate risk to obtain when started upon expedition knew that chance of success be extremely slight that there might be certain amount of danger to encounter from wild beast perhaps brigand have never calculated upon risk a certainly be not prepared to accept responsibility of leading others into there be again silence be broken at last by dia proposal of young senor be very bold one a say don harry after leaving position must be followed surrounded in forest must be very bad must say let wait for at least week will still give time to reach gold valley by then savage may have left other plan may have occurred to at rate at end of week will see how thing go indian may have made attack may lose heart after be repulsed may find difficulty in procuring food though hardly think be probable still many thing may occur in week if at end of time be still here can decide whether to try such plan a young senor have thought of whether to wait until indian leave then return to cuzco for feel certain that place can not be found except by help of star well then bertie said must not hit upon plan to frighten what sort of plan bertie well of course must not make balloon mean fire balloon because have paper to make with if must must let up at night with red blue fire to go off when got up high must think must scare horribly yes must be still better bertie if must make balloon big enough to carry mule everything else out of place drop somewhere about spot want to get to oh be very well to laugh harry said knew must not make fire balloon only gave that a example if have powder enough might make rocket must think must scare pretty badly yes have got powder bertie have plenty of cartridge for sporting purpose for fighting rocket be thing want lot of powder besides saltpetre charcoal so on yes yes know that bertie said testily suggestion be that might frighten somehow still see why must be able to do let try to hit upon something else there be good deal in what young senor say dia said gravely indian be very superstitious think anything understand be magic be worth thinking over before do anything else might find out how many of there be at other end of ravine only few may be left possibly whole tribe may be gathered there at nightfall to night nothing will be settled to morrow night will go down torrent with jose will carry double barrelled gun with senor if will let have when get to other end will take up station there jose be small active must crawl forward ascertain how many of there be if must be discovered be not likely must run back to must have four barrel ready to pour into must stop for must think be there be going to attack before must recover from alarm must be back here again that seems good plan dia see why bertie must not go down with must be better not senor in first place may have men posted at end of ravine though two of might crawl down without being seen just a crawled up here must be more likely to see four in next place might chance to crawl down hillside above just a be going down ravine maria animal must be at mercy be hardly likely to choose exact moment when be to be away quite agree with that risk must not be run well bertie said returning to former idea if dia can go down there still think that somehow might get up scare harry laughed well think over bertie if can suggest anything promise that dia will do best to carry out very well bertie replied gravely will think over now harry said have better sleep in watch at night one must be at breast work one must listen for noise on cliff must be hardly possible for number of men to crawl down without exciting suspicion putting in motion small stone think senor dia said that will be necessary to keep watch for a knew from noise when fired last night there be number of bird at least one beast fancy be bear from sound of roar up there must be strange if number of men making way down did not disturb of indeed if one bird gave alarm must put in motion besides there be certainly monkey for cry chattering when bird flew up still be perhaps a well that one of must watch will divide a did last night only of course jose take place with quite agree with dia bertie have better get three hour sleep at once then after dinner will sit by fire here smoke listen dia will watch gorge keep one ear open in direction too be comfort to know that if can not get away by going up stream indian can not get down to attack from direction two night day passed indian be still on hill once twice men came down distance shot from harry rifle sent speedily back again third night bertie be on watch saw nothing suddenly there came three sharp tap discharged one barrel of gun at random down ravine then held ready to fire other a soon a saw anyone approaching be anxious minute for before other three ran up what be bertie have seen anything three arrow tapped against wall so fired one barrel to call up have be looking out for someone to take shot at with other have not seen anyone though a may imagine looked out sharply be probable that after lesson got other night did not come so near that merely shot arrow to see if be still on guard however may a well stay here for bit to see if anything come of nothing happened however returned to tent next morning bertie said to brother look here harry have be thinking over plan of mine really think there be something to be done with well tell plan in first place how much powder can spare there be that great powder horn jose drag about with to charge musket with will contain about couple of pound must say ought to do think well what be plan bertie in first place do think that burned wood must do for charcoal depends on what purpose want for want to prevent powder from going off with bang oh well must think that burned wood ground to powder must be just a good a charcoal so be still thinking of rocket two pound of powder wo make many of not above two fair sized one betting be must not go up be not thinking of rocket of squib cracker know when be at school made lot of worked very well idea be that if must crawl up close to where indian be assembled carrying dozen squib a many cracker must light lot of cracker first chuck among then send squib whirling about over head with good bang at end must set off running must never stop till be back in own forest well really do think that be fine idea splendid idea only drawback be that in order to carry out must want lot of strong cartridge paper have paper except note book have thought of harry though bothered for good long time see case be only to hold powder to burn regularly a powder doe at first thought might find wood like elder get pith out just a used to do for pop gun unfortunately must not burn might however make of linen have linen no leather bed bag be lined with coarse sort of stuff cover mattress with tick mean yes tick now struck that must do for cracker must have to cut in strip three four time width of cracker then must get maria to make stiff paste starch must be better of course have none then taking strip of cloth must turn over one side of inch from edge to make sort of trough pour in gunpowder carefully paste rest of fold over over then when begin to dry double up tie with string must then only have to add touch paper of course must make out of anything put into end fold must break up few of cartridge soak in wetted powder then cut up into small piece stick into end of cracker think must do first rate have made dozen of cracker feel sure must turn out good lot of now squib will be easier must only have to paste one side of strip roll up so a to form suitable case when be dry must put thimbleful of powder into then fill up with powder charcoal in order to make sure of loud bang must undo piece of rope wind strand round case for inch half from bottom of course when have ground down burned wood must mix with powder try one two of squib so a to find proportion of charcoal to be used have evidently thought out well think doe end of credit authorize to begin experiment at once first thing of course will be to get wood char must think that must require at least two pound of to two pound of powder have better only do little at first just enough to make experiment know will require ramming down well when dia who be on watch returned found bertie at work burning piece of wood scraping off charred surface harry explained plan to a have frequently seen firework at lima dia quickly grasped idea be splendid senor thing will frighten far more than gun will think so many devil have got among will heighten effect by discharging piece that can among in confusion will think be firework be killing must be necessary for otherwise when recovered from panic found that one have be hurt might summon up courage to return at noon next day bertie with assistance have four squib two cracker ready for trial squib contained respectively one two three four part of charcoal to one of powder hold in hand while be trying experiment bertie lay down on stone one by one touch off with burning brand from fire take care that have good long one with exception of jose who be on watch gathered round first squib exploded with bang second did same with le violence third went off in explosive spurt fourth burned a squib must do though little fiercely gave good bang at end go off rather too rapidly bertie harry said must want to whiz about in lively way a long a possible must put in five part of burned wood next time will try at once bertie said have got lot of case made enough burned stuff to make eight ten more mixture be soon made case charged bertie ramming down mixture with stick have cut to fit exactly heavy stone a hammer be done after half spoonful of mixture be poured in then inserted strip of touch paper will take in hand said there be fear of exploding want to throw into air see how burn there touch paper be lit when mixture started burning bertie waved squib high above head threw into air flew along fifteen yard then exploded think can better bertie might make case bit stronger burned out little too quickly will probably not be able to get very close to cracker be equally satisfactory except that agreed that somewhat larger charge of powder must be used to increase noise of explosion now bertie harry said will put hand on to business donna maria will make good stock of paste cut tick into strip for width will make case for squib dia will take charge of manufacture of charcoal will be long job for a have two pound of gunpowder will want ten of charred wood not quite a much a harry because will want powder alone for cracker bang of squib also for making touch paper for of well will say ten pound anyhow have big stock of cartridge can spare few of for so good purpose be soon at work by night case be made drying be left near fire so a to be ready for filling in morning dia then said jose will go down to night senor of course will go with must find out in first place how near mouth of ravine savage be gathered whether keep watch what force have will be well not to make ourselves known to until at least greater part be gathered there if be only to scare small party others when came down must know nothing of panic might take up pursuit wish have mean of driving off top of hill dia see how can be done senor probably in day two will go down of own accord must by time have satisfied that there be getting at from above that must be too dangerous to attempt descent here under fire of gun will be very likely instead to go down to morrow next day to hold general council in case may decide to risk climbing down at night to make grand assault on breast work if can not bring to that may decide to leave dozen men to watch entrance while rest scatter over forest in case watcher must only have to go off summon when started again a might well imagine that must not find position like again expect be what will do if there be hundred of will find difficult to feed long certainly men on hill will get little to eat up there well dia be sure warn jose to be careful may be posting sentry at mouth of ravine just a be keeping at end may be think be likely will know that must not abandon animal that if passed through must have difficulty in over taking must then have at mercy last thing must want be to prevent from leaving position certainly must not fear attack from knowing that there be four of woman therefore think probable that will keep at little distance from entrance so a to tempt to come out hope be so dia still jose will have to be very careful will be careful senor know own life will depend upon crawling along a noiselessly a snake if be seen of course will come at speed back to unless be hit by chance arrow will not run much risk for by time be ready to shoot will be out of sight on such dark night a in shade of mountain tree will be ready to send four barrel of buck shot among when come up be sure to stop long enough to allow to get under cover of rifle before can overtake think that need be at uneasy about senor will start in hour time so that jose can get near before go to sleep will probably have fire burning if not only guide to position will be sound of talking will strip before leaf so that if catch sight of will suppose that be one of bertie now relieved jose who came back have long talk with dia be ready now senor here be fowling piece be already loaded with buck shot bertie have taken down rifle gun will give latter a pas suppose jose will take weapon only long knife senor may be useful if come upon one of suddenly at barricade jose stripped retaining only pair of sandal be a noiseless a bare foot must be needed a in dark might tread upon thorny creeper strike against projecting rock good bye jose harry said now be careful must be great grief to if anything happened to will be careful indian wo catch never fear harry bertie shook hand with then dia stepped into water keeping close along by wall of rock started on perilous expedition like bert harry said a lost sight of seems cowardly thing to let lad go into danger while be doing nothing be just what feel harry must have volunteered willingly will do great deal better than must there be doubt about harry agreed of course when be out with mule often travel at night certainly dia can see in dark good deal better than can there be suddenly slight movement behind turned sharply round be senor be anxious about dia did like staying there by thought must not mind if came up sat by certainly not harry said sit down make comfortable think there be fear for dia can not be taken by surprise for will hear by shouting if discover jose may be quite sure that will bring to stand with four shot will fire among a come near so will get good start might run faster than can in forest will scarcely be better able to make way up torrent when dia have be gone twenty minute conversation ceased sat listening intently in ten minute seemed hour to harry said savage can keep watch at end of torrent jose must have got safely away very slowly time passed must have be gone hour bertie said at last quite must think bertie at rate may feel assured that have gone well so far for though might not hear yell of savage over rustle roar of torrent must certainly hear gunshot half hour passed then to relief heard dia call out be well little distance down in three four minute must see two figure approaching give gun dia harry said then will help up rock might go off if be to make slip now while jose be putting on clothes tell what have found out have not heard much senor a soon a rejoined started off coming up torrent have not much chance of talking told that there be many of that be camped at little distance from stream just a thought must be will stay here harry bertie said can hear news then come tell very well will be back before long dia wife harry walked down towards tent bertie chatted with jose while latter be dressing must feel horribly cold jose said be cold now think of did not notice while be watching savage when took to water again did feel maria will make cup of hot coffee then will be all right again be good fun to look at know that have idea be so close if must have understood language must have learned something worth telling felt inclined to scare by giving tremendous yell know must have got away right be sitting round big fire must not have be able to see in dark must have done only thought dia must have blamed for letting know that one of have come down canyon must have be angry jose so must brother for must certainly have set watch afterwards must have spoilt plan now run along teeth be chattering sooner get something warm wrap up in blanket better fire have burnt low when others returned armful of stick be thrown upon at once kettle have be left in ember at edge by maria when started so that after have hung in blaze for two three minute began to boil coffee be soon ready at point jose ran in after have drunk large mugful told what have learned when left dia at mouth of ravine said everything seemed quiet walked along edge of stream for fifty yard keeping ear open may be sure saw light glow close under rock distance on other side of river followed stream down till came to place where there be quiet pool there swam across then very carefully made way to where must see light be quite three hundred yard from river a got near must hear talking crawled along like cat took good care not to disturb leaf to put hand knee upon dried stick for must not tell whether have anyone on watch near fire perceived one at last came to point where must see flame be in opening running hundred foot into mountain perhaps forty foot across at mouth in be sixty seventy savage sitting standing round fire have evidently be made there so that anyone coming down to mouth of ravine must not see fire be not very large one good many of men be gathered outside little hollow of be talking loudly seemed to that be quarrelling over something sometimes pointed up to top of hill sometimes towards mouth of ravine must have got close if have understood language presently saw of lying down so that must see that quarrel whatever be about be coming to end that be going to lie down for night a must learn nothing further crawled away went down to place where have swum river before then crept quietly up to dia who be on look out for although have seen no one a have passed before there might still have be of on watch have done very well jose harry said have learned two thing first that be not keeping watch at mouth of ravine because feel sure that will not try to escape because wish to leave be giving opportunity of doing so in second place have learned what force have got down there exact position fact that be evidently arguing how have best attack well from what say there be chance that will be able to come upon without being noticed till be close enough to throw firework among really only thing for to learn be whether many of be still at top of hill hardly think there can be many only few have shown to day must know very well that must not venture to climb up during day that must be next to impossible for to do so in dark even if made up mind to abandon animal store well must say dia there be reason why must put matter off will not take long to load squib to morrow opinion be that at dusk have better saddle mule pack everything on in readiness for start then at ten o'clock can go down attack savage best moment for doing so will be when be just lying down when have sent flying will come up torrent again start with mule a soon a be daylight must be next to impossible to get down in dark a might very easily break leg by rubbing against wall shift pack tumble into water must be pity to waste time senor will get torch made to morrow of tree have resin by melting can make torch must do very well by aid must get mule down without waiting for daylight a have already come up torrent will have le fear in going down for stream will help instead of keeping back will go first with jose mule be a steady a rock where go others will follow with five torch along line will be able to see well enough four torch dia wife rode coming up have better ride going down can hold torch a sits doe not matter to if get wet to waist must be very uncomfortable for will have to put largest burden on to mule one of riding mule must carry two llama if think that be too much can tie across separate mule be more trouble coming up than mule put together have pretty nearly to carry through deep place though at other point leapt from rock to rock cleverly enough be not going to be left behind if be going to fight senor donna maria said if will give one of pistol must manage must think harry said can put on one of steadiest mule when first go down with one at side of can manage very well jose must go on hundred yard ahead to see whether of savage be on watch at end if so must wait till have cleared out see will have hesitation in shooting of if necessary though must bring rest of down on yet when squib cracker begin to fly among may be sure wo face for instant dia grumbled that wife have better stay where be till went back for mule harry said do think dia that have better go with must be cruel to leave now that be going into fight leave alone to tremble for life with knowledge that if thing must go wrong with savage will soon be up here well senor if think so there be more to be said be not going to be made trouble of maria said will go down on foot like rest of will take other clothes with so that when come back for mule can change into perhaps must be best plan harry agreed now will go back take bertie place be turn to be on watch will be wanting to hear news well harry be all right bertie asked a heard brother coming up to must be better there be sixty seventy of in sort of little ravine three hundred yard away on left hand side of river seem to be keeping guard at if be not more careful to morrow night will take completely by surprise be going to saddle mule directly get too dark for of fellow on hill to see then must set to work pull down enough of barricade here to allow to pas when go down will cross at willow place above here go down river at side otherwise sha' be able to cross except at distance beyond other end of torrent of course mule must go down side a will want to turn to right when get off will make attack about ten o'clock bertie went off three hour later dia relieved harry a soon a be light next morning bertie jose set to work to fill case there be hundred squib fifty large cracker donna maria after breakfast went out returned with number of flexible stick of about inch in diameter carried into tent where shut up for forenoon when at one o'clock came out with result of work resembled chair without leg with back about foot wide three foot high what in world have got there donna maria bertie asked know have never seen thing like before be thing porter use for carrying weight sometimes people over cordilleras see that strap near top go round man forehead when there be weight in chair other strap pas over shoulder under arm then round be on seat what be going to be on seat be laughed dia be so overbearing have be arranged nicely a know then when spoke to afterwards said 'the first thing to morrow morning maria will set to work to make porter chair will carry down stream word about do a be told ' generally dia let have own way senor when talk like know that be useless to argue with perhaps be best after for a said to afterwards be nasty place for men to get along for woman with petticoat dragging trailing round must be almost impossible for to keep footing well thought same thing when be talking about yesterday bertie said of course did not say anything be sure dia be right found very hard work to keep footing really believe must have done if have be dressed a woman dia can carry like carry senor must carry three time weight have cut staff seven eight foot long morning to steady think there be need for why be common thing for people to be carried over cordilleras so dia be stronger great deal than many of men who do a said if have be going through on foot must have be bothering about be not a if two people must go abreast one help other there be often only room between rock for one to pas through be just there where rush of water be strongest chapter ix signal star during afternoon dia who have be keeping careful look out at cliff said to harry think senor that savage be leaving hill hour ago saw man walking along where generally see be going straight along a if for fixed purpose thought at once that might be bringing message from people below lost sight of after bit presently must make out men moving in other direction be keeping back from edge several time caught sight of head against sky line when there happened to be little irregularity in ground be not running seemed to to be going at steady pace since then have be watching carefully have seen one on other side think have be sent for will be assembled afternoon at mouth of torrent be very glad to hear dia be just what wanted in one way dia said must be great thing for to catch together for have fear that will stand when firework begin to go off among be drawback then be senor that have be collected because have given up hope of catching at present be going to scatter hunt till venture out must be worst thing possible have made up mind to make rush upon think that can beat back not if be determined senor see ca make out till be within twenty thirty yard of at most brother must fire four shot then must take up rifle will have then only four shot left if continue rush where will be there must be two of on one wall two on other there must be four shot to fire from one side four from other then end must come two on side must not be able to keep back rush of two three score in two minute must be over yes dia see that if be determined to storm place take alive must do have firework did not think of yes having once worked up being mad with excitement even might not stop though must think must yes believe might feel assured that must beat back if so must hear more of if knew that must come harry said must certainly say have best stay defend ourselves ca be sure that be motive for assembling may a say be going to move off leaving perhaps dozen men to watch entrance report if attempt to escape must be fatal only chance must be to leave everything behind endeavour to climb up one side other even might not avail a there may be one two men up there to see if make off way be more inclined to think that be course that will take rather than risk heavy loss of life must have good idea of what must cost to take place what do think have better do then senor think have better attack a soon a possible after nightfall be likely that will hing before morning a say like moving at night if attack will not be until shortly before daybreak there be sure to be palaver when men who have be on hill come down will be too late then for to go back before night so think be pretty sure to find in ravine evening if when get there find place empty must come to decision a to what best course will be in case think ought to climb hill make way up mountain a rapidly a possible must calculate on eight ten hour start by keeping a much a possible on rock might hope to get so high among mountain that must not be able to follow trace overtake before reach point where must not dare follow in case of course must have to give up hope of finding gold valley lose mule with belonging must cripple terribly very well senor think be best plan then will settle to start at nine o'clock dia then discussed arrangement for attack be to carry glowing brand when got there be to sling gun behind hold twelve squib in one hand brand in other when approached within throwing distance of savage be to lay gun down beside then harry be to put end of squib against brand hurl whole of among indian few second later bertie be to do same while harry fired one barrel of buck shot bertie be to fire a dia threw dozen cracker then jose be to throw squib then be to throw squib cracker a far a must go other two barrel of buck shot jose musket be to be poured in by time calculated savage must be in full flight three rifle must then be used harry be to hand rifle to dia before firing began bertie be to slip fresh cartridge into gun recap before sending off last batch of firework so a to have in readiness to empty content into flying indian to cover retreat must firework fail to effect panic hoped for pistol be also to be reserved until indian fled donna maria be to stay by water start at once on way back if dia shouted to to do so step of plan settled upon be repeated again again until there be possibility of mistake being made maria have not attended council confidence in two white friend be unbounded bertie invention of firework have placed on level with brother in estimation therefore quietly went on with preparation for dinner without concerning a to detail of affair a soon a be dark meal eaten tent be struck baggage rolled up packed on animal firework divided when everything be in readiness went together made breach in breast work wide enough for mule to pas at nine o'clock maria be seated in carrying chair strapped on to husband back then four brand be taken from fire party started when within fifty yard of lower end of ravine jose went forward returning in few minute reported that savage be on guard fire be burning outside mouth of ravine where have seen on evening before from reflection on rock believed that fire be alight inside report caused general feeling of relief for great fear have be that native might have made off before arrival when stepped out from water dia set maria down understand maria said moment call be to start up river understand said have knife if rejoin will know how to use will rejoin maria dia said confidently believe that at first volley of firework will be off must be more than human if be not scared a never can have heard of such thing before keeping close to rock wall went along in single file until within forty fifty yard of fire then going down on hand knee crawled up slight rise from top of must see hundred more native gathered round fire one be addressing others who be seated listening attentively laying gun down to be ready for instant action keeping concealed in herbage harry took bundle of squib from pocket be lightly tied together slipping off string applied end to brand there be sudden roar of fire waving once round head hurled into midst of assembly there be yell of astonishment a missile flew hither thither exploding with loud report last have not exploded when bertie handful flew among then came parcel from dia at same moment harry poured barrel of buck shot among followed by volley of cracker while almost simultaneously harry threw squib bertie fired volley of buck shot for moment savage be paralysed then many of threw on face in terror of fiery demon while others started in headlong flight send off a quick a can harry shouted a discharged second barrel into flying native bertie followed suit then paused to reload while dia jose hurled remaining firework by time last of native have leapt up fled jose musket three rifle cracked out then little party rose to foot joined in wild hip hip hurrah can come up maria have gone dia cried out maria joined minute later more than score of native lay dead badly wounded round fire what be to do with wounded bertie asked can only leave where be harry said of savage may have wandered away not have come down from hill will return here unaware of what have happened one two of boldest may venture back again to look after comrade at rate can hing for must be better to shoot senor dia said must not bring to do harry said buck shot unless strike in body be not likely to kill expect be more frightened than hurt after have gone many of will be able to crawl down to river savage frequently recover from wound must kill white men even if others come down who be slightly wounded will help more incapable have cleared way for ourselves be wanted have taught lesson be not likely to forget for many year to come let go back at once bring down mule suppose will sit down by stream wait till come back maria yes said there be nothing to be afraid of now can leave one of pistol in case one of savage may be shamming dead jose will wait with dia said now jose strike up song be generally at a long a hear will know that of be still here will not venture to move take gun jose be loaded harry said if of must move try to crawl away fire at if look about seem inclined to make mischief shoot at once coming down with animal three men carried torch in hand mule reached mouth of torrent without accident llama be then lifted off baggage mule have carried be turned loose to graze on rich grass near edge of river jose dia went to fire in ravine returned laden with burning brand fire be soon blazing near water two of kept watch by turn at spot from have fired lest of wounded indian must on recovering try to avenge loss by sending arrow down amongst party during night four of fallen indian after first looking round cautiously crawled away watcher must hear running fast through bush till be beyond light of fire at dawn start be made river be crossed at pool where jose have swum over dia on examination found that water even in deepest part be not more than breast high accordingly returned maria kneeling on one of shoulder one of harry be carried across without being wetted then joined animal be grazing short distance away set off without delay although kept sharp look out saw more of indian ascended several more stream unobserved rough carving on face of several of rock led to carry excursion farther than usual beyond few ounce of gold washed from stream found nothing must have be put here for purpose said dia have be thinking over dia must not be surprised if a thought be done to deceive searcher told there be mark by must be directed in gold valley be quite likely that other mark might have be placed in valley so that real one must not be particularly noticed that be possible senor must certainly do everything must to prevent anyone not in secret from knowing mark have to look for first be serpent be carved on rock at end of valley in case indication of star must not be necessary dia may be senor valley may be large one hiding place very difficult to find so even when valley be known must need guidance of star to take to right place might be so dia if be hidden treasure that be looking for a according to account be simply extraordinarily rich deposit in river hardly see why guidance of star must be necessary when once valley be known that can not tell senor be sure that must be difficult to find for spaniard searched everywhere for gold although record of most of discovery still exist there be mention of such find be there be word of among indian tradition week before appointed date found in neighbourhood where felt sure cleft must lie mount tinta be twenty mile in front of from point range of mountain trended off almost at right angle to be following one lofty peak thirty mile to south east rose above believe that be peak dia said see sign of cleft in dia senor be very narrow one next day halted at mouth of valley a unloaded mule harry exclaimed see dia there be cleft in peak from here look a if be mere thread a if giant have struck mighty sword cut into be right sure enough senor must be valley now let look about for serpent search did not take long isolated rock rose quarter of mile from mouth on be rude representation of serpent next morning explored valley thoroughly to point where five mile higher ceased abruptly rock closing in on side stream coming down in perpendicular fall from point eighty foot above going down river washed gravel again again without obtaining even a much gold a have found several time before can not understand harry said a sat down to meal at dusk tradition say nothing about hidden treasure yet there doe not seem to be gold in stream may be higher up senor must ascend hill on side of valley come down upon river higher up harry be on watch that night at one o'clock roused others up see exclaimed later on there be bright star apparently about foot above peak must think that must be star doubt will rise in exact line behind cleft on st be four day from now probably can only be seen when be exactly in line with cleft position of gold cleft be undoubtedly very narrow doubt result of earthquake certainly go straight through very likely be hundred yard across so that unless be exactly in line sha' see a soon a be dark on st will go distance up valley where be only about four five hundred yard across will station fifty yard apart across then one of be sure to see star through cleft have better take two stick with see star will fix one in ground then go backwards for hundred yard keeping star in sight plant other then line between two stick ought to lead to spot night star rose nearer to cleft there be doubt will see in proper position to morrow night harry said on th of month that certainly be strong proof that tradition handed down to dia be correct employed next day in again searching for indication might assist in vain dia jose asserted that tiny rift in rocky peak looked wider from middle of valley than at other point even harry brother admitted that must scarcely be seen from foot of hill on side therefore be agreed that dia harry jose must take place only forty yard apart across centre maria bertie going farther near side of hill when midnight approached took station suddenly harry who be standing by side of rivulet exclaimed see be more than minute later before dia saw while be three four minute before jose spoke by time harry have crossed streamlet fixed second rod distance on other side dia jose did same bertie did not catch sight of for time after jose maria did not see at then went back to camping place be curious must have seen before of when be standing so close to harry said be lower than expected be evident that cleft must continue much farther down than thought that must be extremely narrow at bottom be certainly splendid guide there can be mistaking unless have be standing on exact line must not have noticed star till later crack be so much wider towards top that must probably be seen on line mile across will be strange if can not find place in morning certainly searched in stream just where be standing found nothing of course be possible that in time may have changed course considerably dia shook head can hardly be that senor because in case anyone who have examined valley must have found begin to think that must have be mistake about being merely rich place in river that must be vast treasure perhaps hidden by people before inca kept by a certain resource when needed will have to search think for walled up cave in rock have already looked for not seriously besides there be many boulder have fallen formed bank at foot of cliff well will know in few hour feel absolutely certain that line between two stick will lead to none attempted to sleep a soon a became light took pick shovel started up valley harry gave exclamation of surprise a standing behind first stick looked towards second line go to middle of waterfall said be so for stream made two three sharp bend between spot where have crossed foot of fall be strange dia said have examined that spot more than once there be great stone boulder at foot of fall large deep pool can treasure be buried in if so will be hard indeed to get harry did not reply face be white with excitement walked forward slowly till reached edge of pool be fifteen yard across colour of water showed that be very deep will dive harry bertie said have gone down more than once in five fathom of water to pick up egg have be thrown overboard stripped swam out to middle of pool dived be down about minute on coming up swam to shore must find bottom harry panted be sure must have gone down seven fathom thank bertie harry said quietly will make up mind that if be there sha' get at present foot of valley be so flat that must need cut at least mile long to let water off must therefore require army of men regular diving apparatus there must be no getting side of england however may not be there let search now behind fall there be four five foot clear between sheet of water rock at time a harry pointed out there must be even wider space for weather have be dry for past two month quantity of water coming down be small while in wet season mighty flood must shoot far out from rock width of stream in wet season be shown by broad bed of what be now rivulet looking upwards a stood wall actually overhung must see edge where water poured over unbroken there may be cave here harry went on may be covered by rock piled up for purpose on other hand may have fallen think be most likely explanation for a top project beyond bottom be possible that time other there be big fall searched foot of rock within reach there be sign of man handiwork rock be solid thickly covered with dripping moss fern have flourished in mist spray rose from foot of fall have ruthlessly scraped off with pick silently went out again at end stood hopelessly looking at fall be time before harry said must move of stone now let go at once cut down young tree for can hing with hand alone must use lever for purpose will want straight wood strong have better get dozen in case of break make about ten foot long from four to six inch thick sharpened slightly at lower end in hour lever be ready have better breakfast before begin dia wife went off to prepare when came out from waterfall dare say be ready by time in hour be back again chose central spot behind fall then set to work of rock be dislodged without much difficulty to move others be necessary to first get out smaller one on rested so toiled on stopping for hour in middle of day for food then renewing work by evening have made opening four five foot wide at top six foot deep close to wall be now getting dark be fagged weary with work light be fading be glad to return to camp maria came out to meet asked question said cheerfully have good olla ready be sure must want feel almost too tired to eat bertie said will feel better when have have coffee have fed mule jose taken down to water think bertie said when have finished meal that might splice main brace do think might harry laughed have not opened bottle since started certainly have worked like nigger since seven o'clock morning will open case be screwed down have screwdriver in handle of knife rose to foot what doe don bertie want dia said will get senor understand what said be sea expression dia after hard day work captain order that main brace will be spliced mean that crew will have glass of grog be glass of spirit water to cheer warm after exertion jose will bring blazing brand with will want to see screw in few minute returned be brandy dia suppose have ever tasted glass of good brandy be kettle boiling still senora will want hot water sugar five of tin mug have of lime picked other day yes senor that be good just slice will be improvement harry mixed four mug half one for maria there dia said will allow that be considerable improvement on pulque brother have already lighted pipe other three have made cigarette dia jose be loud in commendation of new beverage donna maria have at first protested that never touched pulque must be same sort of thing however after sipping daintily finished portion with evident satisfaction did not sit up long a soon a have finished first smoke all retired to bed leaving for once llama mule to act a sentry a soon a be fairly daylight drank cup of coffee started again to work harry went first into hole have made kneeling down struck match to enable to see rock more thoroughly gave slight exclamation then said open knife bertie come in here strike match want hand have torch here senor be best then light bertie there be just room at bottom for bertie to stand by side of brother who be lying down hold torch a low a can bertie harry picked away with point of knife for minute two then sat up be top of cave said do see crack along here be straight one fancy be top of entrance to cave stone under have rough face on top side be straight be fitted in with cement something of sort be soft for distance in then becomes quite hard can just see that there be two stone underneath also regularly cut made room for bertie to lie down held torch for think be right harry three stone must never fit together so closely if have not be cut by hand though looking at face one must tell from rock above dia next examined stone there be doubt that be entrance to cave senor said a joined three went out beyond fall for noise of water be too great for to converse without difficulty behind veil of water jose stayed behind to examine well dia have found place where treasure be hidden think that be much nearer certainly have not strength sufficient to clear away fallen stone probably cave be blocked by wall several foot thick must want tool blasting powder to get through doubt be natural cave seems to probable that altered course of stream above so that must fall directly over entrance think before talk further about will go up there take look at if find that course have be changed will settle matter took hour to climb hill make way down to gorge through river ran examined carefully must always have come along here dia said there be other possible channel there be mark of tool on rock on side of fall water go over so regularly that think rock must have be cut away at bottom certainly look like dia rock widen out too so that however strong rush of water may be will always go over in regular sheet let follow along little way fifty yard farther on gorge widened out suddenly paused with exclamation of astonishment before be wide valley filled to spot where be standing with placid sheet of water four five hundred yard wide extending to gorge fully mile away bertie be first to find voice here be go who must have thought of finding lake up in hill here did not know there be one dia said have never heard of be not strange for one who came up valley must dream that there be anything beyond fall harry have sat down thought for minute looking over lake without speaking be afraid dia said at last that tradition be true one after that gold lay in bed of stream in valley now see filled up must always have be lake senor dia said after thinking for minute must not have be willower for there be other escape than waterfall however heavy rain must not have risen higher except few foot a one can see by face of rock may have have other way out harry said dia looked carefully round side of valley there be break in hill can see senor firm conviction be that top of cave that found behind fall be really top of natural tunnel through stream originally flowed there be two three reason for in first place be certainly remarkable that there must be cave immediately behind that fall thought at first that stream above might have be diverted to hide ravine be so narrow that must not be possible in next place tradition have proved absolutely true in matter of star in hour of appearance in exact line to mouth of cave how correctly detail have be handed down from generation to generation if be right on point be hardly likely that can be inaccurate on other point that tale of extraordinarily rich treasure must have be converted into one of exceptional deposit of gold in bed of river think that passage be probably closed by old people when be first threatened by invasion of inca doubt must choose season when stream be almost dry have a remains of vast building will show unlimited supply of labour must first partially block up tunnel perhaps for first fifty yard in leaving only small passage for water to run through might then close farther end with sack of sand having other stone cut number of hand build up behind sack then go on with work till be solid then doubt must heap stone boulder against face of wall by time inca have conquered country valley must be lake many foot deep inca having gained abundant supply of treasure elsewhere must take step towards opening tunnel in case must have be terrible business for pressure of water must drive everything before having plenty of slave labour at disposal knew that must be done at time in case of great necessity when loss of life of concerned in must be nothing to when valley became full water began to pour out through gap perhaps happened to be immediately over mouth of tunnel may have be altered by few yard to suit for be a know from of building such good workman that must fit slab of hardest stone so perfectly together that be hardly possible to see joint therefore must only have to widen mouth of gorge little fit rock in on side so that must seem to have be there for time indeed natural growth of fern moss must soon hide joint even if have be roughly done that mean harry bertie asked that mean that have more chance of getting at gold than if be lying in deepest sounding in pacific bertie sat down with gasp there be way of getting that water out harry went on quietly except by cutting channel here a deep a bottom of lake by blasting stone in tunnel one must require year of work with two three hundred experienced miner ten time a many labourer other must need twenty thirty miner hundred two labourer there be possibly way a must require immense iron siphon going down to bottom of lake along one side of ravine down into bottom of pool with powerful engine to exhaust air in first place set going be a impracticable a far a be concerned a other two in same way have doubt that with thousand horse power engine lake must be pumped dry in time to transport plant for engine boiler across mountain must be enormous undertaking even be here put up going difficulty of supplying with fuel must be enormous certainly one must not get up company with capital enough to carry out one of scheme merely on strength of indian tradition with uncertainty even if believed tradition whether amount of gold recovered must be sufficient to repay cost incurred well may a well go down to dinner shouldered pick led way back scarce word be spoken on way bertie tried to follow example of brother take matter coolly dia walked with head down air of criminal going to execution disappointment to be terrible have along felt so confident that must be successful that must be enabled to enrich considered a preserver of life that be utterly broken down with total failure of hope chapter x fresh start not until got to camp did harry look round when caught glimpse of guide face went up to held out hand must not take to heart dia have be unfortunate can not be helped have done everything must in matter brought to right spot one must tell that when got within mile of gold river must find valley turned into deep lake can only say 'better luck next time must say in england 'there be a good fish in sea a ever came out of ' have never felt very sanguine about have all along seemed too good to be true of course be disappointed may have better luck next time know senor with certainty of other place one be ever entrusted with more than one secret so that if spanish torture wrung out of two treasure must not be lost need not talk more about place dia see wife have got of fish that caught yesterday fizzling on fire now think of be very hungry for be six hour since have coffee morning after have have meal can discus what next move have better be while be speaking jose have be rapidly telling misfortune have befallen tear be running down woman cheek must not feel so badly about maria harry said cheerfully see brother be quite cheerful at rate one be to blame must have be enormous piece of luck if have succeeded never looked on a certainty anything might have happened between time gold be shut up now though certainly never expected to find what did only thought possible that might have luck to find treasure now have better look to fish will lose breakfast a have lost gold time by own fault be a hungry a hunter of in fact be hunter although have not brought game with time woman wiped away tear hastily taking off fish have put on when be coming down hill laid on plate with freshly baked cake fish be excellent bertie a ate made several joke set laughing so that meal passed off cheerfully now for great consoler harry said a took out pipe when have lighted up council will begin never mind clearing away plate now maria just sit down with there be wisdom in many counsellor now dia what do think be best course for to adopt at present unless wish to stay here make further search by mean dia harry said for present have seen enough of side of mountain will get back to cuzco make fresh start from there in case senor there be doubt a to best route there be pas over mountain just on other side of mount tinta lead to town of ayapata lie somewhere at foot of peak have never be there know situation be very steep pas a be used for mule traffic can not be very bad once have passed over on to plateau will not be more than seventy eighty mile from cuzco be quite satisfactory will set off to morrow have better catch more fish for have have time for hunting lately maria said meat ate yesterday be last have with if cut fish open lay flat on rock be so hot one can scarcely hold one hand on will be sufficiently dry by sunset to keep for two three day before that be sure to shoot something river be full of fish in hour have caught abundance having fifteen averaging eight pound apiece be at once cut open cleaned laid down to dry fishing on river must let for handsome sum in england harry laughed think fish be quite a good a trout of same size only objection be that be so tame take bait so greedily that good a stream be must soon be exterminated that evening there be slight stir among animal have just lain down jose leapt up walked towards there be something matter dia cried llama be standing up with ear forward see hear something may be puma jaguar dia said take gun senor picked up rifle harry bertie followed suit further armed with shot gun have best come with maria husband said there be saying where beast may be see mule be standing up now pulling at head rope let go among senor presence will pacify moved towards mule be standing huddled together dia jose spoke to patted stand at head maria former said keep on talking to must see if can discover beast there be one of exclaimed in low tone do see two bright point of light be reflection of fire in eye will fire senor not yet if be only to wound must charge let wait till get closer probably there be two of male female generally go about in pair even a spoke seeming spark disappeared have moved dia said will probably walk round two three time before make up mind to attack if must go near fire must get fair shot at dia wo do senor will most likely go backwards forward in semicircle getting perhaps little closer time ten minute passed then maria said there be two of can see outline distinctly do think if be to fire gun must move off dia might for time senor probability be that must come back again have smelt mule be probably hungry be better to let attack at once have done with minute two later there be snarling growl be jaguar dia said again again threatening sound be heard in spite of maria effort mule be almost mad with fright have better lie down beyond dia said there be doubt beast will come from side if posted behind mule might break loose knock over just a be taking aim lay down side by side on grass with rifle at shoulder can see now dia harry whispered not more than fifty yard away think must hardly miss now must not if be daylight senor in dark when ca see end of rifle can never be certain about shooting beast have now apparently made up mind to attack crouched low almost dragging belly on ground one be somewhat in advance of other be male ahead dia whispered do brother take aim will take female jose will hold fire of buck shot till be within length of how will know when be going to spring when stop senor be sure to stop before spring aim between eye bertie fire when do harry whispered to brother who be lying next to when within twelve yard jaguar halted now harry said discharged rifle at same moment dropping grasped shot gun jaguar fell over on one side clawing air then recovered a did so two charge of buck shot struck on head rolled over remained motionless dia have fired at same moment have not stopped second jaguar jose instead of waiting hastily discharged gun in instant dark body bounded over head on to back of one of mule struck to ground harry bertie leapt to foot discharged second barrel into jaguar body turned suddenly round attempted to spring hindquarter be paralysed bertie pulling out pistol fired barrel into head brute at once fell over dead lad gave shout of triumph thank goodness be over without accident harry said be formidable beast dia in daytime when one can see to aim can be killed easily enough senor at night presence be to be dreaded be afraid have lost mule think not senor be knocked down by shock have saddle on brute have time to carry off mule rose to foot a spoke jose ran brought flaming brand from fire blood be streaming from animal shoulder stuck claw in senor have not made long gash must say that wound be caused by contraction of claw when finished with pistol animal will be right in day two a store have diminished need not put load on for time hope be not frightened maria bertie said be little frightened said when mule came tumbling down close to must see jaguar eye within few yard of have dagger ready must not have be much good dia said if beast have attacked think showed end of pluck bertie said if have come close to have got nothing little dagger in hand must have bolted like shot be sure that must not senor said be great deal too brave for bertie laughed be very well to be brave with rifle in hand gun ready to say nothing of pistol by way thought harry have given one of so did have forgotten about if have thought of must have used be just a well that did not harry said if have done so brute must have made for instead of turning round to attack now senor dia put in have better drag jaguar away mule will never get quiet with body so close to needed strength that of companion to drag of body fifty yard away now jose dia said when returned have better give animal feed of maize round will settle down after will keep watch to night senor be not likely that more of beast be in neighbourhood be a well to be careful think of must sleep if someone be not on look out will relieve at two o'clock harry said senor have not be on watch for past two night must rather sit up by fire to night two day later arrived at foot of pas just a gained met two muleteer coming down dia entered into conversation with while others erected tent preparing to camp what be news dia harry asked a returned men say senor that pas be very unsafe many robbery have taken place in several men who endeavoured to defend against brigand have be killed be questioned by four armed men a came down good be carrying down to ayapata be taken from say that traffic have almost ceased on road be bad dia very bad senor need not be afraid of brigand if meet a travel along foot of hill must be thing in pass there be many place where mule must have to go in single file if be caught in such spot by men on height might be shot down without chance of defending successfully be awkward dia be scandal that brigand be not rooted out people be thinking too much of fighting other neighbour to care anything about complaint of few muleteer senor be there other way of crossing mountain than by pas there be pas senor between ayapata crucero be very bad one where must be then dia well senor must take along other side of mountain to macari from place there be easy path to la raya there be on plateau again have only to travel by road through sicuani to cuzco in fact must double length of journey to cuzco yes senor if liked from crucero might go down to lake titicaca there be certainly good mine in mountain there yes be there chance of finding ca say that senor fear that chance must be very small then be of use trying dia saw at last place what pain old people took to hide place where gold must be found if there have be rich mine among mountain speak of doubt must have hidden just a carefully question be will go up pas a intended take chance will go by roundabout way by time jose have lit fire have seated by one hate turning back be not pressed for time a far a can see only chance be feeble one of finding treasure in place spoke of up coast above callao be now four month since left lima travelling straight to place must take how long well senor if go round by ayapata to crucero then to macari must be nearly thousand mile quite thousand must think be three month steady work by time get there will be about year from time left england have seen quite enough of mountain to know that chance of finding anything among be so small that be not worth thinking of seems to therefore dia that might just a well instead of going south over difficult pass return by foot of mountain a have come going through paucartambo crossing river flow fall somewhere other into amazon keeping along till come to cerro de pasco there must be nearly in line with place know of can keep due west be to say a nearly due west a mountain will allow must be three four hundred mile shorter than by taking pas at ayapata must have good deal of sport by way must certainly have trouble with brigand till got to cerro of course be possible that might fall in with savage again at rate be not so formidable a brigand in pass what do say to be certainly shorter senor a say must have trouble with brigand must also escape trouble have be going on for year be likely a far a anyone can see to go on for ever be very fortunate in not meeting of army be always marching about chapter xi brigand three month be spent in journey to foot of pas leading up to cerro have good shooting found difficulty in providing with food fish be plentiful in stream in of long deserted plantation found banana grape other fruit in abundance together with sugar cane tomato maize growing wild potato be reverting to wild type met with alligator large serpent for kept on lower slope of foot hill a much a possible avoiding low forest land where might come in contact with savage for same reason have opportunity of taking of great fish found in sluggish river have abundance of smaller fish in bright mountain stream killed two tapir several puma jaguar two llama having one night wandered away from mule be killed by beast a store be good deal lighter than when started be great misfortune occasionally followed stream up into hill did little washing for gold when halted for day two there have have good time of harry said a sat round fire be almost sorry that be over that be last day of wandering where like shooting fishing above camping in pleasant place have be very fortunate in not meeting of savage since fight have with four five month ago be splendid country for sport except that must like bit cooler must have done without of thunder storm be grand life for time now be going back to sort of civilization filthy inn swarm of flea fifteenth rate cooking be not so much fault of cooking maria said a of meat here get fish fresh out of stream bird shot hour two before be eaten pick fruit from tree instead of buying after have be carried mile mile to market have capital stock of coffee tea sugar among old plantation pick cocoa pound fresh boil a brought plenty of pepper spice must be hard indeed if one must not turn out good meal then senor always come to eat with good appetite be in favour of cook yes grant that have have advantage maria be not everybody who make best of can safely say that since started have never sat down to bad breakfast dinner now for bit be going to lead different sort of life will be on beaten track will meet lot of people be strange to think except for peasant muleteer met at foot of pas by tinta volcano have not seen soul except savage who have soul suppose since left paucartambo more than six month ago yet somehow seem to have missed wonder what will find when get up to cerro who will be president then wonder what be doing in europe bertie said have heard later news than what have when went on board ship sixteen month ago there may have be great war over europe think there be much chance of bertie india be only place where there be fighting going on seemed a if since napoleon be crushed europe must become permanently pacific still do hope that when be at lima will get hold of pile of english newspaper consul be sure to have suppose will want to stay there many day harry for will be eager to start search for enchanted castle dia have told of saw quite enough of lima during ten day that be there be pas bad one up to cerro dia there be very bad point senor never be good one a nothing have be done to road for at least hundred year must have got into very bad state have be down twice with traveller second time ten year ago be bad enough then be likely to be worse now well a road be used so little dia harry said there be fear of brigand hope not senor there may be though must not be there in hope of plundering traveller desperate men be always to be found in mountain men who have committed murder fled from justice be able to live on what can shoot of course can get fish in stream when be tired of can come down here where will find plenty of turkey pheasant other game besides maize fruit other thing in old plantation sometimes will take little plunder from small village anyhow fare altogether badly therefore one can never feel certain that one be safe from even when travelling over track where traveller seldom pas still may very well hope that will not have bad luck to fall in with hope so dia did not come out here to fight so far have be very fortunate have not have to fire shot except at wretched savage next day journey took far up into hill camped that night at upper end of deep ravine have be hard day work for at several point mule have to be unloaded taken up singly load then carried up fortunately pack be now very light be carried hauled up without much difficulty in morning again started be just issuing from ravine when party of ten armed men made appearance from amongst rock shouted to to halt dia rode in front speak to dia keep for minute in talk if can then take shelter behind boulder then harry ran back to jose who be walking with leading mule twenty pace behind turn back again jose halt little way down then come up there be brigand ahead bertie bring up rifle two shot gun tell maria to remain with mule then ran back again just a shot rang out dodging among fallen rock took shelter behind one abreast with dia be who fired asked one of brigand ball went through brim of sombrero think be talking to other know there be hurry hail again dia show above rock what do want why did fire at want everything have got voice came back mule burden arm if will give up without resistance will let up pas without hindering tell that must talk over with others dia well will give five minute man called back if accept term will cut throat dia stood up walked quietly down rugged pas at point where mule stopped rock rose almost perpendicularly on side maria said do jose take off saddle bag fill up space between rock on side get animal in behind stop with maria have got five minute will help have better go up at once senor went on to bertie help brother so that may not get sight of however be afraid know how many be be foolish to light fire yesterday evening expect be somewhere near caught sight of doubt one of crept quietly down to find out what force be seeing there be four of thought must take easily here in morning without firing shot a brother happened to be going on first thought must parley must be sure that if attacked must kill two three of at least before have finished with a reckoned that must gladly accept term must get wanted without trouble must shoot afterwards if felt inclined bertie have by time got gun unstrapped have filled pocket with cartridge now went forward a kept among rock be able to get within four five yard of brother without being seen a mouth of pas be almost blocked with great boulder can not get nearer without running risk of being seen have loaded double barrelled gun stay where be then bertie think will make rush if do can use a well a rifle of course have pistol have yours believe will venture to attack in daylight trouble will be after dark now then five minute be up brigand shouted be coming dia shouted back a approached harry said stand by side of rock dia so a to be able to shelter a soon a have given answer be likely enough to fire volley will give nothing dia shouted anything want have better come take three men raised head above rock fired almost at same instant harry rifle bertie cracked out head disappeared fierce yell of rage showed that one if not of shot have found mark have better clear off harry shouted there be four of have eight barrel between to say nothing of two brace of pistol volley of curse be hurled back in reply now dia what do think be best move know senor fancy there be only eight of now brother must hardly miss mark like head at thirty pace if be quite sure that there be more of must say that a soon a becomes dark have better creep forward fight must be better to do than wait for to attack there may be very likely be more of band among hill besides dia want to lose one of number must hardly hope to get through unscathed for if be to try to push on must have at tremendous advantage must hide among rock shoot down before have time to level gun at now that have killed one if not two of number will certainly try to get revenge will harass way up pas be not only that senor be booty expect to take must not expect much booty harry said for baggage animal only carry small load gold doe not take up large bulk senor have not least doubt that believe have be gold hunting have probably big amount of gold dust among baggage did not think of dia if believe have gold will take a granted that will do best to get well do think must be good thing to make rush senor must be throwing away life will guess that will probably attempt such thing have doubt that will move away if have done so already hide among other rock then if dashed forward to place where have be must pour volley into finish at once for if be lying twenty yard away ought certainly to hit one of a have eight shot to fire at present have doubt be talking think can safely get back to where piled up saddle bale can defend better there than here can then talk matter over quietly will be best plan dia certainly keeping under cover a well a must retired to barricade thirty yard lower jose aided by maria have completed defence have not however attempted to block passage between two great rock be three foot wide rock lay about six foot from cliff on side space be partly filled by smaller fragment wherever there be open space blanket have be thrust in from behind dia have done greater part of work before went up to answer demand of bandit others have laboured very hard to finish well done harry said a passed through entrance told not to close path dia said can do now be together most of rock be too heavy for jose maria to lift will build up now senor be sure can not force way through while four be holding barricade certainly not dia have fear of attempting think must be a well for to close otherwise must not cross from one side to other without exposing took two hour hard work harder because stone have to be thrown into passage from side a brigand might be crouching among rock higher up waiting for opportunity to get shot at end of two hour gap be filled up to height of six foot now can talk matter over quietly dia harry said may take that whether attack by day by night can beat off there be little rill of water trickle down along centre so need not fear being driven out by thirst have food enough to last fortnight be settled may stay there for time without exposing to sudden death can not find out whether be still hanging about not of course one very important question be be going to be joined by others think certainly will be senor a many of fellow be hiding among hill a must make good sized regiment have only to send off two three of number with news that party of gold digger with five laden mule be shut up in ravine to gather number of must come a quickly a vulture to dead horse must be long time since have really valuable plunder fact that have five baggage mule besides three riding one must show that have probably be very long time away might therefore posse lot of gold be there other pass near nearest senor be on other branch of palcazu river followed till entered pass be about thirty mile to north pas start from spot about fifteen mile above junction go up to huaca place be little more than ten mile south of huanuco from huaca must either follow road to cerro strike across western cordilleras to aguamiro then think dia that best plan will be to go down again into valley left yesterday morning then strike across for mouth of pas speak of know direction know general direction although have never be along there well dia must be guide must say sooner start better idea be if with wife jose will start at once so a to be down pas before get dark brother will remain here will leave riding mule at point where track be good enough for to gallop on must not like to leave senor maria said have not least fear of attacking with rifle double barrelled gun pistol must beat off if did ca see better way of getting out of scrape be quite willing to adopt plan see other way senor dia said plan be good one wish must stay here with must be impossible dia for there must be chance of finding mouth of pas by ourselves why must not go together maria asked because if there be one here brigand might discover that have gone within hour so of starting might fire shot two finding that did not answer crawl gradually down till got here for must seem possible to that must return down pas a there be getting baggage mule to go fast might very well be overtaken mean by eight men by considerable number how be to find way senor dia said will follow valley down till come to spot where have struck off can fasten white handkerchief to stick put in bare place where be sure to see want to halt when get to river somewhere opposite mouth of pas will ride nearly due north when strike river will follow down till reach ca halt opposite mouth of pas for river there be already size must not cross will keep along near foot of hill water there be willow enough to ford then will follow down until a say near entrance to pas there stop on bank till come will do very well in case wo matter much where strike stream a mule can swim across easily enough have have plenty of practice during past six month however will turn off north where can see signal when will leave senor to morrow morning have fear of attacking during night for can hardly bring other band down here before morning a soon a get dark will light two torch put down at foot of barricade so that will be in shadow will show that be still here wo care to venture down into circle of light have let know what formidable amount of firearm have have given lesson that can shoot straight certainly must not come senor a long a torch be burning three hour be a much a can reckon upon burning well have dozen left now dia when burn out must light two more throw over trust to burning a lie among stone of course must not think of going down to stick upright for scoundrel will probably be watching a closely a be watching however will manage to keep light going till daybreak will start good hour before will have to go down cautiously must like to be well away with mule before discover that have left now sooner be off better breakfast have be ready for past hour have better eat get under weigh a soon a can after have gone one of will keep watch while other eats have doubt there will be plenty left for supper yes senor enough cake to carry on till join hour later party started dia having muffled mule hoof so that clatter a passed over rock might not be heard above now bertie go down to breakfast when have done come up relieve have occasion to hurry for be absolutely certain that wo dare to attack till get reinforcement when bertie returned said here be lot of food harry have hardly eaten anything there be plenty for to day to morrow be just like bertie daresay will camp in five six hour feel quite lonely without that doe be really first time have be alone since left lima except of course when be out shooting together be sure show head above barricade bertie must do a have be doing sit down here look out through peep hole between rock shove rifle through so that if see head looking out from between rock up there can fire at once in hour harry came back sat down by brother lighting pipe chatted over event of journey prospect before be afraid harry journey will be failure except that have have very jolly time well so far have not turned out much somehow other have great faith in haunted castle of course demon dia be so afraid of be probably indian who be placed there to frighten intruder away must not keep watch unless have something to guard can not understand how have escaped notice of spaniard year have not much faith in story until found how true be in particular a to what call golden river there be one satisfaction however if place be really castle can hardly have disappeared under lake of course if be in ruin may have lot of difficulty in getting at vault wherever else treasure may have be buried unless be very big place be hardly probable work must be nothing compared with draining of lake have got nearly year in hand harry can do lot of work in time especially if use powder yes see ought to allow at least five month for getting home still doubt if felt justified in writing to ask for three four month saying have great hope of finding something very good in short time must stand out against father little longer will write directly get to lima to say that although have so far failed give up hope be just starting on enterprise promise well bertie held up finger think heard somebody move sounded like stone being turned over for two three minute lay motionless with finger on trigger then fired what be bertie be man leg suddenly saw below rift behind rock expect have idea that foot showed there be pretty sure hit for have time to take steady aim foot disappeared instant fired if did not know be exposed there be reason why must have moved at if have be hit be better to hit foot than head bertie be equally good a lesson if not better for though mean to let kill want to take life unless be absolutely necessary well after proof of sharpness of watch be not likely to make fresh move day passed slowly took by turn to keep watch just before dusk harry said think bertie that might pull out leaf bush dia shoved into one of gap when took blanket thing out must push torch through fix there must save having to cross barricade be quite possible that one of fellow may be keeping a sharp look out a be doing be a well not to set one up a mark if put through now wo show much while if wait till darkness fall will be easy object to fire at keep sharp lookout while be doing if see either head gun try to hit harry accomplished operation without drawing shot a soon a have fixed torch again stopped hole up behind be evident that be not watching very closely said if have not sent for help have gone off with two of men killed two disabled fight must have be taken out of will watch by turn to night be six o'clock now will sit up till eleven will care bit must rather take care however may a well take first watch will start at five so rouse at four if come at be possible not probable will be between four five at ten o'clock harry must see glow of light at distance from mouth of ravine in stillness must occasionally catch sound of voice when woke bertie at lad looked at watch said be hour late in calling harry yes have inclination for sleep fellow have be reinforced of course know to what extent must say pretty strongly have lit big fire distance from ravine must not have dared to light one if have not felt strong enough to fight doubt have dozen men on watch where first saw must give notice if be coming think may a well fire couple of shot will show that be here on guard will suppose thought heard someone coming down to reconnoitre position fired over top of barricade see have renewed torch harry bertie said a reloaded yes have done so twice be very careful however a feared might be watching did not wait for lighted one to burn out passed other one out putting end of poncho round hand arm so that must hardly be noticed even by anyone within ten yard certainly must not be seen from up there a pushed through lighted at stump of old torch then withdrew hand like shot did same thing again hour ago with equal success so be evident that be not keeping very sharp look out above have fear of making sortie hampered a be by animal torch be changed again at four o'clock little later bertie heard slight noise think be coming harry said quietly harry be at once on foot use rifle first bertie sling over shoulder before give two barrel of buck shot so that can start to run at once if stop yes be certain be coming said after listening for two three minute have got two three torch left will give benefit of went back to ember of fire lighted torch returning to barrier threw twenty thirty yard up ravine there be hoarse shout of anger then dozen shot be fired bertie rifle cracked out in return harry followed almost immediately dark group of twenty thirty men be rushing forward have just reached line where torch be burning when four barrel of buck shot be poured into three four fell rest fled at once cry oath showed that many of be wounded wo venture again for present harry said may be sure will hold council of war so load again then will be off two minute later be making way carefully down rocky passage harry carrying bundle have made up of unconsumed provision a have to exercise great care in climbing over rock day be just breaking when came upon two mule have be left behind for rode cautiously until be quite out of ravine then started down valley at gallop in hour bertie exclaimed there be flag rode to then turned off to north slackening pace to trot animal be in good condition a have of late be making short march at eleven o'clock came upon river here waited for hour gave couple of cake to animal ate rest river be fifty yard across mule only needed to swim about distance brother kept beside placing one elbow on saddle holding rifle ammunition well above water be soon across mounting followed river down letting animal go own pace sometimes walking beside a wished to keep fresh for next day work at five in afternoon saw smoke ahead of riding faster now soon joined companion who hailed arrival with shout of joy have be terribly anxious about senor dia said regretted deeply that deserted be not desertion dia be obeying order be on duty guarding baggage there be really cause for uneasiness be certain that must beat off if ventured to attack did do so made feeble attack morning at four o'clock be ready for might have carried barricade have only have rifle buck shot be too much for of course brought down two with rifle there must have be over score of four barrel of buck shot did heavy execution of fell fancy most of others got dose of shot a be in close body will tell about after have have supper have got ready maria said have be expecting for past hour be sure must have good appetite when arrived after story have be told dia said be capital plan of keeping torch burning night especially of throwing two of up ravine when heard fellow coming of course calculated on getting within fifteen yard so before saw well there be fear of hearing more of expect must have be gone hour before found out that have left must not be surprised if after have recovered from defeat half of made big circuit over hill doubt know foot of coming down at bottom of ravine built strong barricade making up mind to guard end until be obliged to surrender from want of food having suffered so heavily must do everything in power to prevent of from getting out alive in case must have be prepared to wait for time dia for knew have eight animal to eat must not have lasted long senor for have only few handful of grain left there be not enough forage in ravine to last couple of day expect must have tried to get to surrender by offering to let pas if must give half of gold thought have with there be chance of being followed suppose dia not slightest when at last discover that have gone will come down pas find where mule be left standing will then see that only two of have remained at barricade will guess at once that rest left hour before will therefore conclude that being on foot have chance of overtaking even if must find track expect by time be dancing with rage a likely a not quarrelling furiously among how far do think have ridden to day nearer sixty mile than fifty senor yes suppose have if have come straight here must have be nearly fifteen mile shorter if pursued must not come way because must not be able to get across think must have to go round ford river mile higher than did must never swim across with gun ammunition to carry must not count on dia might come straight here a must guess that have made for pas might make bundle of reed to carry gun ammunition across swim over must be possible dia admitted reluctantly if knew that five mule be loaded with gold might be tempted to follow that must only guess have doubt too that many of have be walking for hour across mountain before attack a fired into thick of fair share must have be too much wounded to start on forty mile tramp senor think there be chance whatever of pursuing besides chose spot where ground be hard rocky to plant that flag must have good deal of difficulty in ascertaining in what direction went from there pulled up flag staff threw away among bush mile half farther of course brought handkerchief with think need give thought to senor at same time must be a well to keep one on watch night jose will be on guard by turn neither of slept wink last night so must not keep watch time sha' be sorry for good sleep for meal have eaten have made drowsy however if hear least noise wake at once will do senor be great deal more likely to be made by wild beast than by brigand brother be sound asleep in few minute did not wake till dia called said that maria have coffee ready what sort of pas be to day dia not very bad one senor one tried yesterday have be used for very many year there be regular traffic up down not valuable traffic for pozuco be small place send up fruit dried fish oil get from fish bring back cloth such thing a be required in village so there be nothing to tempt brigand to infest pas rob traveller senor when last went through heard talk of at be more likely to infest hill beyond cerro for near place really valuable capture can be made that account for being able to gather so many men to attack journey up pas occupied two day met three four small party of men with donkey mule when questioned said that pas be perfectly open that be very rare thing indeed for anyone to be robbed on way late in evening of second day arrived at huaca be advised to go to priest house a accommodation at inn be so bad man who directed there be head man of place gladly accepted offer to guide to priest house must be best way senor dia said know man here who must willingly put up who have yard where mule must pas night very well dia be sure buy good stock of grain have scarce have for last three day priest cheery hearty man received harry bertie cordially when be introduced a english traveller especially when found that must both speak spanish fluently be pleasure to receive british traveller said cochrane miller have done more for than of own countryman be not often that traveller come way have heard of two three going to cuzco never come farther north than cerro will be delighted if will stay two three day here senor get so little news of world that must be great pleasure to to hear what be going on outside unfortunate country can give little news for be more than year since left england have heard nothing of what be doing in europe a have be travelling shooting at foot of mountain between bottom of pas tinta volcano gold seeking priest asked with twinkle in eye have occasionally washed sand in stream have not found enough to repay work amount have gathered be only about twenty ounce well gentleman will be delighted to have a guest a long a be willing to stay be greatly obliged to harry said will gladly be guest to morrow animal need rest will enjoy one too next morning must be going on a have be away longer than ought want to get down to lima quickly have great difficulty in getting away from huaca where good priest made extremely comfortable be very loath to let go however at dawn on second day started for cerro arrived there forty eight hour later after rough journey through mil never know in peru when go to bed who will be president when wake dia said that evening there have be dozen of in past five year lamar gamarra la fuente orbegozo bermudes salaverry succeeded one then santa cruz became master nieto have upper hand for bit at time there be travelling on road be so infested by robber one band be master of lima for time then chilians occupied lima santa cruz be defeated gamarra came in again none of men be ever supreme over whole country general mutinied with troop under other leader sprang up altogether there have be trouble civil war ever since spaniard left be why country be so full of robber when army be defeated who escaped took to hill lived by plunder until other chief revolted then must go down join so have gone on who composed army because field seem to have be well cultivated peasant be quiet enough yes senor for most part take part in affair men who compose army be in first place remains of who fought against spaniard when spaniard left country men have nothing to do be ready to enlist under anyone who raised flag promised pay of bourse there be many men in town who be too lazy to work who help to keep up supply of armed men good god only know when thing will come to end few of who have come into power really loved country hoped to establish order do away with abuse caused by men who be appointed to office by one of tyrant most of be ambitious soldier who led mutineer against chief of moment if heaven must destroy strike with blindness soldier above official in country might hope for peace good government best man who have ever fought out here since lord cochrane left place be general miller countryman who be splendidly brave be always true to word never allowed soldier to plunder never ill treated captured in battle ah must have made president must never have done a chilians be jealous of lord cochrane peruvian be jealous of miller first because be foreigner secondly because uprightness fidelity be reproach to ambition treachery greed cruelty besides understood too well if peru have asked to be president knew well enough that conspiracy against must begin next morning ah be great man well senor think that before start will be well at least must go on to ayapata find out what be doing must only delay two day might be better able to judge a to route to take may be fighting in north want to get mixed up in way in quarrel think must be very good plan dia start in morning will stay quietly here till come back with news if many brigand be in pas might get to hear of from someone going over from side take into head to come down must certainly rather not have to fight with away accordingly next morning dia went on ahead on following evening rejoined there be fresh trouble in south senor colonel vivancohidas have declared regenerator of peru be now marching against gamarra general castilla be advancing against fighting will be somewhere near arequipa whichever win will presently cross mountain make for cuzco then that settle dia certainly have heard nothing in gamarra favour great deal against since landed care nothing about side hope new man will win because think that change from gamarra will be improvement chapter xii prisoner when arrived at cerro de pasco found that division of gamarra army stationed in district have mutinied have declared for vivancohidas be killing known a adherent of gamarra traffic be at stand still number of soldier who did not choose to join in mutiny have taken to hill be pillaging convoy peaceful traveller alike think senor dia said that instead of crossing cordilleras to west a have intended will be better for to go south skirt lake of junin make for oroya be route generally taken for pass be terribly difficult have traversed route many time when going with merchandise always go through oroya though in returning from cerro take shorter route very well dia be best judge of that be great nuisance that rising must have taken place just a want to traverse country ca be helped will go to head quarter of quinda be established at mayor house here get pas from must be well perhaps if be to go with dia to confirm statement that have be shooting hunting hope will give pas so that will not be interfered with by men gathered at different point on road to oroya hear that considerable portion of force have already marched forward peruvian colonel questioned harry closely a to motif for travelling there suppose said have be searching for gold be sorely in need of fund will feel obliged to borrow gold that may have collected for use of army giving order on treasury at lima will of course be honoured a soon a authority of president vivancohidas be established doubt goodness of security harry said quietly although possibly might have to wait time before order be cashed while hunting have not come upon treasure have occasionally when halting at stream amused ourselves by doing little gold washing when tell that during eight month since started from cuzco have only collected about twenty ounce of gold may well suppose that good fortune have attended be that senor give word of honour be senor a will have to lay in store of provision so on for journey down to lima may well imagine that must be serious inconvenience to to part with quite so senor so small sum a must not go far among four thousand men under command however will have pleasure in giving pas that ask have have good sport hope a good a expected kept in food have seen splendid country hope time will again be cultivated add to wealth of country after further exchange of compliment harry returned to inn where have put up next morning after purchasing coffee other store be needed set out now be right dia harry said a started hope so senor from what heard yesterday evening several strong band of disaffected soldier be in hill between oroya quinda troop have by mean joined several company broke off have stationed in hill along road have stopped robbed more than one mule train with silver from mine there have not meddled a far a hear with quinda troop have simply seized opportunity of perpetrating brigandage on large scale well must take chance dia fortunately have money enough at lima to replace animal have pretty well finished store beyond tent bedding must be matter of hundred dollar there be nothing worth thinking of still certainly want to lose hope sha' fall in with of scoundrel hope not senor perhaps have better put gold dust money in jose boot be le likely to examine than be have better put half in boot give other half to wife to hide about clothes will want money if be robbed to take down to lima with gold dust must get couple of mule enough provision to take down there must be in very awkward position if found penniless stopped for night at little village close to lake there be one small room at inn at other end of straggling village there be yard where mule must stand loft where dia maria jose must sleep harry brother have lain down hour on blanket when there be shouting in street two three shot be fired leapt up have better hide rifle pistol harry said under ragged bed that did not care about sleeping on may possibly get again even if be robbed of everything else minute later four five men with lantern rushed into room be armed with musket one carried torch who be man asked be english sportsman harry said have be shooting for month at foot of hill be now returning to lima there be gun see will take before captain man said bring gun along pedro juan village be in uproar fifty men be occupied in searching house in appropriating everything thought useful one house have be set on fire near man in officer uniform be standing heard report of harry bertie capture english sportsman eh how long have be shooting asked eight month eight month then guard securely monte be doubtless rich englishman will get good ransom for english senor who come out here to shoot must be men with plenty of money likely enough be not sportsman gold seeker however matter little protest against harry said consul at lima will demand satisfaction from government other laughed government said there be government if there be must have power up in hill so saying turned away plunder have be collected be brought in divided among party four of men with musket keeping guard over prisoner see anything of dia mule bertie said in english have be expecting to see brought up minute now be beginning to hope that have got safely off think fellow began attack at end of village know how watchful dia be very likely jose be up may be sure that moment heard uproar must drive mule out be off see only two of be laden must have thrown thing on to back be off at once must know that be

captain bring out of hut where be be letter have compelled to write to request large sum of money to be sent in exchange for a felt certain that must rescue somehow thought be pity that letter must go down so started at once to follow have not got more than quarter of hour start of by line have taken saw that intended to go to junin did not think likely that must enter place because must be sure to meet of quinda men there must probably sleep at small village near then make circuit to strike road beyond town fortunately have money in pocket at first farm came to bought mule see senor have not lain down night before have done fair day work before started to follow captor have walked twenty mile with have be busy morning knew must not be much le than thirty mile to junin that if must not

said in tone of surprise of course what else must one do with be brigand have attacked peaceable village killed several people even if have not wanted to get paper must have be very meritorious action oh be not blaming dia at there be other way of getting paper may be regarded a act of necessity what did do with horse jose went on with returned to town again started with maria mule journeyed to village half way to oroya of course overtook jose mile two after have left junin there put up at quiet place talked over situation knew that there be particular hurry for read letter knew that harm must come to for long time must be month at least before must expect men back with money there be letter addressed to don mariano carratala whom know to be busy politician in money be to be paid to at least be to receive from two men immediately left british consul house be to hold for valdez be name of brigand thought must not trust men to bring up sum like that must be enough to tempt most incorruptible peruvian certainly men sent down must have taken good care never to come to part of country again if have got money into possession think either must have be safe in hand of carratala if did not know that sooner later must get knife between shoulder if kept next morning maria started back bringing with four mule fastest have rode on two led others knew people at junin for have often passed through town when have be bringing down silver from cerro one managed to get for little barrel of pisco be sure that soldier must refuse glass be almost sin to give such liquor to dog then bought peasant clothes parcel of good such a travelling hawker carry know how succeeded of course have drugged pisco heavily knew that two glass must send man off to sleep in hour a soon a be dark maria went on with mule will find half mile from here at deserted hut where left other three mule well dia have assuredly saved life guarded a be there be not slightest chance of getting away by ourselves a british consul certainly must not have raised sum demanded must have have throat cut when messenger returned empty handed valdez be not man to go back from word in respect be pity have lost arm senor yes have certainly lost double barrelled gun rifle pistol be hidden in straw of bed in room where slept have just time to hide before brigand burst into room then can recover senor of course intended to ride straight to junin wo make very much difference will ride to village get rifle pistol then follow road by lake be now only nine o'clock can be there by one easily reach junin by morning will be perfectly safe to rest there suppose guard will be relieved about twelve o'clock yes be time heard changed will most likely discover that have gone then when find four guard sound asleep be sure to unbolt door see if be there then of course will give alarm at once hardly think will even attempt to pursue be infantry none of be mounted officer mean that at present only valdez have horse must know that have be assisted that probably horse be waiting for somewhere there be hut senor maria ran out a came up saint be praised exclaimed that be with again senor saint be doubt to be praised harry said feel at present good deal more indebted to dia than to be indeed grateful to managed splendidly brother felt so confident that must do something to get out that be not in least surprised when recognized diaz got up a travelling hawker did not tell that be with fortunately asked question at took for englishman travelling by ourselves may have thought of afterwards in hurry of carrying off booty apparently gave matter attention if have done so must probably have sent party out in pursuit of mule even if have not done so must have be sure to look with suspicion at two hawker arriving at out of way village at time well have better be moving at once dia said be going down to village where be captured maria hid rifle pistol there when found place be in hand of brigand three minute later started there be full moon so be able to ride fast be just midnight when arrived at village when knocked at house where rifle have be left proprietor looked out from upper window in great dismay fearing that brigand might have returned however a soon a recognized party came down opened door arm be found where have be hidden in five minute be again on way arrived at junin at five o'clock be necessary to wait here twenty four hour to rest animal next morning started a soon a be light picked up jose convoy brother mounted two horse dia maria rode on one mule led three behind jose rode led four horse mule dia have bought be sold at oroya after purchasing enough provision for rest of journey started for lima having concluded that must be better now that be on main track to follow instead of striking across hill chapter xiii letter from home there be little discussion over amount of supply that must be necessary to purchase travelling quietly journey will not occupy over fourteen day harry said get anything more than be absolutely necessary be evident that whole country be in disturbed state be a well to have nothing to lose can buy nearly everything want in way of meat flour at village pas through therefore if have enough tea coffee sugar there will be really occasion to buy anything more have still two three bottle of spirit left can buy pulque everywhere there be proverb two three thousand year old 'the empty traveller can sing before robber be reduced to condition except for tent bedding blanket have done good service must not cost much to replace there remain then only animal must certainly be serious loss to brigand must not want to take must not be of least use to in mountain must not say same of party of disbanded soldier making way down to lima callao who might prefer riding to travelling distance brigand might take rifle pistol dia yes must be sure to do senor have have more than share of bad luck already what with brigand in cerro pas rascal have just have to do with will enquire when last silver convoy went down if one have gone during past five six day must overtake soon for can do two day journey to one if convoy have gone forward later there be one starting shortly might be worth while to wait for for by account road down to lima be infested by discharged soldier ruffian of kind from callao lima have convoy escort yes senor silver mine have always considerable force in pay used to have troop from division stationed here what with constant revolution fact that more than once escort instead of protecting convoy mutinied seized found better to raise force take creole preferring pure bred indian who be just a brave a creole if not braver can be relied upon to be faithful to trust consequence be that in spite of disturbed state of country be long time now since one of escort have be attacked especially a robber must find great difficulty in disposing of silver a ingot be marked with name of mine come from might of course melt up again even then there must be difficulty a law be very strict a to sale of silver certificate have to be obtained from local authority in case stating where be obtained be hard upon native for many of little mine be worked among mountain rascal to whom official position be given in reward for service done to party happens to be in power for time take good care to fleece indian heavily before will give necessary document nothing can be done here senor without greasing palm of two three people grease have to be pretty heavily laid on dia went out made enquiry there will be convoy for fortnight one went down ten day ago certainly will not wait fortnight dia a to escort le than dozen men must be useless a must be fortnight at least going down a much returning even if must get twelve men who must be relied upon must be very expensive job might a well risk losing baggage even gun great thing will be to reduce weight a much a possible four cotton bed take up lot of space think in case must have bought new one at lima at rate can go blanket poncho must of course carry behind so practically there be only two tent cooking utensil store will not weigh many pound to carry with clothes whole will make ridiculously small load even for one mule have better get rid of pickax shovel must fetch pretty nearly a much here a must give for new one at lima thus then with donna maria riding one of mule there must be five self three led mule of only one must be laden must offer great temptation to plunderer a will have gun across shoulder must see that must not be worth while to interfere on very slight chance that one laden mule might be carrying anything valuable agree with senor appearance must be that of party of traveller who have be exploring old ruin a have be done before endeavouring to ascertain whether river on east be navigable down to amazon besides bulk of people here forget what owe to englishman fact that be of nation must in secure good treatment for among except desperate men accordingly started next morning maria rode in amazon fashion on mule between husband harry bertie followed with jose to whose saddle three baggage mule be attached in single file be undisturbed on journey three four time be hailed by men on rock above a went through difficult point of pas reply of dia that two gentleman with be englishman who have be exploring ruin doing little shooting among hill generally satisfied one two however who enquired what mule be carrying be invited by to come down see though at same time be informed that load contained nothing blanket cooking vessel enough provision to last on way when within two day journey from lima party of rough men came down into road dia rode forward to meet repeated usual story can examine mule if like said warn not to interfere with english senor be not men to be meddled with be armed with rifle carry brace of double barrelled pistol be dead shot too may reckon that will cost over dozen life be to interfere with moreover other muleteer must give fair account of ourselves rather than have trouble however two of can come forward see that statement a to what mule carry be correct burden must not fetch fifty dollar at lima two of men came forward examined mule burden felt saddle of others to see that nothing be concealed there when rejoined party one who appeared to be leader came forward senor said regret that have stopped be poor men be obliged to take to road to live perhaps honour must not mind giving ten dollar to buy food at next village illustration saw approaching peasant woman sitting on mule have not many dollar left harry said if really need food be welcome to ten of for will need nothing more than what carry till arrive at lima handed ten dollar then showing purse said see there be five others with many thanks man retired companion took off hat a harry party rode through such stoppage harry said with laugh will have to fall back upon little stock of gold dust however met with more trouble on following evening rode into lima took up quarter at hotel dia asked that might go on with mule to home in first place senor want to know how thing have gone on in absence have arranged with neighbour to look after garden house be glad to do so a garden be fruitful one be to take must raise keep well planted so that whenever might return must find usual supply of fruit vegetable in next place maria be nervous about staying here after what happened last time may take a certain that friend of men hurt will take chance of paying off score if can find opportunity will come in day to see if have order for there will be occasion for dia have quite made up mind to wait here for week before starting on next expedition so if will come over in four day will be quite soon enough can overhaul blanket bag see that good enough to keep be put in good repair worn out replaced will want quite a many store a took last time for there be very few village except on sea shore will find difficulty in replenishing stock will have to buy double barrelled gun in place of lost that will do have plenty of ammunition cartridge for rifle pistol have only few shot cartridge left when lost gun a soon a dia have gone on with mule harry went to british consul found three letter waiting there for two from miss fortescue one from mr barnett put former into pocket to be read enjoyed privately opened that of mr barnett at once be in answer to harry have written at cuzco dear harry said first letter be quite satisfactory be glad to find that have reached lima without encountering more than stiffish gale be a well a must have expected be still more glad that have found dia alive willing to accompany letter from cuzco have now reached think be extremely lucky to get through street broil without damage to of be certainly hazardous business to interfere in affair of kind without having weapon except stick carried still can well understand that a must certainly have lost service of dia have not done so be worth running good deal of risk a say have natural effect of binding to heart soul feel very uneasy about have blamed many time for suggesting scheme to can only say that be really only possible way in seemed to must carry out task set in fairy story be so far a can remember not uncommon thing for king to set task that appears absolutely hopeless to suitor for daughter hand hero always accomplishes impossible be always done with assistance of good fairy unfortunately good fairy be not to be met with in present day have great faith in dia fear that be very poor substitute for fairy godmother still be convinced that will do in power will even strain conscience severely by conducting to place where tradition lead to believe that gold in shape of mine hidden treasure be to be found search will not improbably lead into place where indian have won back own from civilization introduced by spaniard have always heard that on eastern side of cordilleras native entertain deadly hatred for white attack who endeavour to penetrate into forest be too rash lad remember that will not add to lady love happiness to learn that have be massacred in attempt to carry out knight errant adventure if be careless about own life forget that loss will probably entail loss of brother also danger of course must meet face remember prudence be valuable aid to bravery be glad to know dia have taken wife with woman be very useful adjunct to expedition such a yours of course in way be necessarily trouble always responsibility still if a say be case with be good cook make wonderful difference in comfort certainly add to chance of preserving health in next place must fall ill be mauled by tiger puma will make far better nurse than dia must be now that be cutting adrift from civilization will not expect to hear from again for long time will try not be uneasy really harry do feel have incurred very heavy responsibility may with best intention in world have sent bertie to death have a directed addressed to care of consul must be many month before receive many month more before again hear from must require more money draw upon have always good balance standing at bank therefore hesitate to draw in case amount sent out to quarterly doe not prove sufficient to carry out scheme may have in hand with good wish for own bertie welfare remain affectionate guardian james barnett when returned to hotel handed mr barnett letter to bertie to read said stop down here in patio bertie have two letter want to read quietly bertie laughed right harry take time over wo disturb be dusk now when harry went to room lit couple of candle seated in large cane arm chair opened letter first one consisted chiefly of expression of pleasure at arrival at callao of remark upon voyage of complaint a to long time have passed without news of of assurance of affection second be like mr barnett in reply to letter from cuzco dearest harry after reading letter have be more more impressed with heartlessness in allowing to undertake such journey a have before ought to have be braver ought to have refused absolutely to allow to go prospect of being able to overcome father objection really amount to nothing ought to have said must not accept sacrifice must not allow to run such risk that must be better kinder for of to accept inevitable not enter upon struggle with fate think that be already growing weary of waiting that heart be in way changed be not that be anxiety about feeling how wrong be to let go be there even shadow of chance of success must wait patiently for year say that life be pleasant one be not father be still bitterly angry with for a say throwing away chance be to say of marrying man care for simply because be rich can bear that mother be very very good doe in power to cheer a know have never be much more than cipher accustomed always to submit to father will be wonderful to that in matter have ventured not openly to oppose to give what strength comfort can hardly know how must have got on without comfort father hardly speaks to treat a if have be convicted of deadly sin be only restrained from punishing in way because by blunder other contumacy against will of father have be omitted from penal code seriously harry make unhappy not only for for until be unable to give in to in question have always be kindest of father be sure feel estrangement between almost a much a do belief that be acting for good be great pain to can not see matter in same light a doe of course to be most ridiculous that must suppose that happiness depends upon having title cutting figure at court sort of thing there be arguing over be a thoroughly convinced that view be correct one a be that be utter folly however be almost a sorry for a for myself must do almost anything short of giving up to make happy however think that be very miserable because be not somehow though ca give good reason for belief do think will succeed say that think for moment be likely to come home with sum father named a necessary seems to be quite hopeless think somehow may succeed in doing well though people might consider that be justified in refusing consent to what might think be bad match must not do so with justice be to determine upon marrying gentleman with fortune think great deal of public opinion must know that even must be against indeed harry be beginning to doubt whether in end will be able to sacrifice life to unfortunate mania must marry what call well love told that if at end of two year be not in position to claim hand must give in to father wish will keep promise so far will not run away with marry in defiance of command a have agreed to wait for two year for may ask to wait two year for when think of going through sort of danger hardship for sake feel that must be downright wickedness to turn against if find that can not perform impossible task instead of separation making le dear to be affecting in quite other way thought be always with how must be otherwise have worked up to such pitch have almost resolved that when two year be up will say to father ' will ask harry to release from promise to for two year father will go about allow men fair chance of winning love if at end of time have met one to whom can give heart will then go own way if harry will take will marry ' will require great deal of courage to say so be doing so much to try win that must be hard indeed if be to shrink from doing little on part still must make easier for if must have good fortune to bring home something not because a have told many time must shrink for moment from renouncing luxury in have be brought up for care so little because must in eye be proof of how earnestly have striven to do what must to meet requirement did not mean to say when began letter seems to that will give heart strength in work that will see from too have taken courage in hand show that love faithfulness will day have reward deserve god bless keep dearest loving hilda harry read letter through again again at last bertie came in what at still harry said with laugh must have got letter by heart by time have be sitting in patio by for two mortal hour expecting to come down at last said to myself 'this sort of thing will bring on madness when healthy sailor forgets that brother be waiting for supper to say nothing of be clear that there be something radically wrong be evident bertie at present know nothing of human nature if there have be anything radically wrong in letter must probably have be down long ago be just contrary hilda say that if succeed here will give rather father two year at end of time if doe find someone like better will marry whether like not at least be what come to congratulate old boy at same time be evident that must not have be worth salt if have arrived at other conclusion now having settled that comfortably let go have something to eat appear to forget altogether that have have nothing since breakfast be now past eight o'clock boy think of nothing eating harry grumbled well up till now harry from time started have observed that have very healthy appetite can tell have cost dollar in bribing cook to stay on beyond usual hour did not like to tell that be engaged in reading love letter fifty time so put delicately said that be engaged in business of importance went against conscience to tell buster there come on bertie have begun to hope that be growing into sensible fellow be afraid that there be chance of now that will continue to be donkey to end of life harry have told dia that have better take two three day at home before came into lima again to surprise muleteer came in at ten o'clock next morning well dia did not expect to see again so soon have found everything right at home hope senor be sorry to say did not three day after left here house be burnt down burnt down dia be sorry indeed to hear that how did happen thought said that have locked up left one there be so senor people who took over garden be to go into house once week to see that everything be in order a fire broke out only three day after left have not entered everyone say that must have be fired on purpose for flame seem to have burst out in part at once one in town thought have enemy in world have be wondering who must have have grudge against of course need not go very far to guess who be at bottom of suppose not dia must have be scoundrel gave thrashing to there be doubt of senor time have got best of for know very well that have proof against that must be useless to lodge complaint be afraid must dia be quite burnt down wall be standing senor take good deal to burn adobe what do suppose must cost to put in same condition a before with furniture everything no great thing senor two hundred two hundred fifty dollar must not be a much a if have be that maria have left festa dress silver trinket behind there be not much furniture in house think must replace everything for about two hundred dollar have good deal more than laid by will certainly make up to dia be entirely kindness in deciding to take on mr barnett recommendation to undertake journey brought ill will of scoundrel upon of course be of use doing anything now when search be over will certainly see that be not in way loser senor if must not replace might accept kind offer can do without breaking very heavily into saving indeed attack on be outcome of old grudge have be long regarded a fortunate man truly have be so if there be job for five mule be disengaged always have first offer be not fortune dia be because be known to be wholly trustworthy there be few muleteer who be not so senor be rarely indeed that muleteer be false to trust can scarce remember instance indian have fault be honest well perhaps getting first job to go with foreign traveller may have be piece of good fortune be because be so well satisfied with that others engaged trustworthiness be not only thing wanted in muleteer willingness cheerfulness readiness to oblige be almost a important for comfort of traveller well do think fellow will try play trick dia hope will dia said savagely be if have too much odds against owe big score now for twice have got better of must like to get even with well dia hope wo try anything of sort if anything must happen to must not only be extremely sorry for sake wife must destroy last chance have of carrying out search for treasure do think that if be to go to consul lay complaint against on ground in first place of attack on now of burning house must have effect if be to make complaint might do senor certainly must not be to do so little bribe must of course be necessary can not do anything without that official here be gamarra men there be not one of who must not take bribe must be worth while a be only going to stay here week if got imprisoned must be out again before came back must be more anxious than ever to get rid of there be good deal in dia a of course will be away starting for home again a soon a return here spite must be directed entirely against hope senor while stop here will never go out without pistol be against have grudge now more than be owing to that failed in killing will do so wo carry stick time so that if see going along will think be unarmed whenever went out after dark indeed harry bertie have idea that be followed on way home invariably carried cocked pistol in pocket ready for instant use be well that did so for on returning late one evening from senor pasquez four men suddenly sprang out upon be on guard arm went up in instant two shot be fired a pistol be almost touching men head when trigger be pulled assailant dropped dead others at once took to heel there be two of dia enemy wiped out harry said quietly hope others will give chance before leave well let walk on before watch come along must ruin plan altogether if be kept here for indefinite time while enquiry be being made next morning heard from waiter at breakfast that two men have be found dead in street be muleteer said be known to be bad character be suspected of having be concerned in several murder be evident that made mistake time have got what deserved be known to be associated with others there be five of one be killed in knife fight month ago search have be made for others be not likely that will be caught be probably concerned in affair knowing that must be suspected of having hand in that character will go against expect went off at once to foot of hill wo be heard of again for time to come think pity be not shot be shame in town like people can not walk in street after dark without risk of being assassinated dia be very pleased when on coming up that morning heard of what have happened quite agreed that other men must almost certainly have taken to mountain even if have not senor be safe from attack now know that carry pistol be prepared for will let alone when come back here dia will give brace of pistol trust will carry in pocket ready for use after dark whether be in lima at miraflores thank senor think be likely to show face here again for long time at rate will be on guard will gratefully accept offer of pistol now senor must set to work to day to get in store for next journey have made list of what will want well have plenty of money dia for find two remittance from home awaiting here have already bought two double barrelled gun stock of ammunition principally buck shot for will not be doing much big game shooting can always buy food at sea side village three day later be in readiness mule be brought up from miraflores by jose accompanied by maria early start be made on following morning chapter xiv castle of demon to morrow senor dia said will see spot be telling about where a tradition say spirit of ancestor inhabit ruin of building so old that be ancient when inca first came here be still there men who have be rash enough to approach spot have be found torn to piece a if by wild beast none go near now did spaniard never go there know not sir 't be likely never even heard of country be dry barren there be mine to tempt indian never speak of who be alive when spaniard came have reason for not doing so even now must go to nearest village lie more than twenty mile away ask people about must only say that have never heard of that such place existed for believe that even to speak of must bring dire disaster indian be christian spaniard made so make sign of cross bow before image picture once year go to church among tribe east of mountain be believe in tradition of father in demon of forest though on side of hill where spaniard held tight grip upon people have well nigh forgotten old faith still believe in many of tale have learned from father of castle of demon a be called be a strong a ever in part have ever seen castle dia have seen senor there be only one point from be visible will go there to morrow be ten mile from here castle lie in rift of rock must say that in ancient time opened to sea building closed entrance whatever may have be doe not rise above summit of cliff go down a straight a wall for mile on sea face rift on land side of castle seems to have width of about fifty foot must see opening be suppose window rock on side be higher than castle so that anyone coming along must not see until looked down upon of course be visible from sea dia must have be visible in old day without doubt senor can not be seen now stone be colour of rock beside be stained broken unless boat went along within very short distance none must dream that there be break in cliff there heard that from fisherman whose boat be driven in by gale well nigh lost said that must see that stone be very large much larger than of in remains of building of inca be not in regular line be very strange that anyone must have taken trouble to build place in such singular position be there not legend a to construction there be tradition senor that be built a prison by king of time thousand year before spaniard came even before people whom inca conquered came into land that be place of imprisonment say of wife others of son who have rebelled against say that be built by demon a happened long before people came here none can know well dia seems to that old place be very likely to have be used a hiding place for treasure a to tale about demon of course be ridiculous took advice when be being opposed by fierce indian when be question of demon can trust to revolver rifle against legion of well senor be master have led here a promised there may be treasure here there may not if will go must pray not to command to go with must have followed to death through swamp forest on other side dare not risk being torn to death by demon being left without burial press to go dia respect conviction though share in have have year of travel with have have many adventure together will be last before return home here at least there seems to chance of finding treasure infinitely better chance than have have except in gold valley here be mysterious castle of whose very existence spaniard seem never to have heard be just place where treasure might be hidden if have guardian must be human also there can be few urgent necessity for secrecy be so great that must like other secret have be confided to few only maybe one two old men be there of whom certainly need not be afraid have told why came here why feel so anxious to find valuable mine part of lost treasure of inca so far have failed altogether must be fool a well a coward be not ready to run slight risk in searching mysterious castle so be senor say not that may not succeed may be that demon have power over white men if go return safely will go with must find treasure aid to carry away will lead to within two mile of will wait three day for return if come not then will return to place mourn for very well dia may count upon return long before three day be up now in first place take to point from can have view of castle have have long journey to day senor be two hour journey from here have better rest go in morning harry nodded will be off early say be ten mile from spot where will see if start at daybreak can be there before noon will give plenty of time for first look round place have got torch left will want for possibly there may be chamber underground into will have to penetrate may take a certain that whether old people hid great treasure from inca inca hid one from spaniard did not leave about in room stowed away in vault like saw at pachacamac will certainly want lot of looking for will help look senor will work there a long a like in search if return tell that have seen heard nothing of demon be said to be there be not afraid of danger when know that be men that have to do with dread being strangled torn a legend say that who have ventured here have be according to own account dia bertie laughed be long long ago demon may have got tired of guarding place that one came near have gone elsewhere in search of victim dia shook head gravely in spite of life a muleteer acquaintance with englishman be a superstitious a rest of countryman nominal christianity enforced by spaniard upon native be skin deep thus clung with undying fidelity to superstition tradition have be handed down from generation to generation have be preserved with tenacity even torture of spaniard have failed to shake failure to obtain gold confidently expected to find in valley have still further strengthened belief that be destined that treasure must never be discovered although when there have listened gravely to harry explanation of manner in lake have be formed own conviction that be work of demon have be unshaken if then spot even tradition handed down to have in way connected with guardianship of demon be so firmly watched how much more must be so at spot legend agreed be inhabited by demon have be scene of so many execution by of who have ventured near a bertie brother sat together by fire that evening after others have retired to rest talked long over matter for just a when have approached gold valley excitement have increased with day journey harry felt that be last chance only hope of gaining object for have left england be strange harry bertie said that native must believe absurd story about demon dia seems in other way a sensible fellow a one can want to meet in respect be a bad a of be not extraordinary bertie if remember that be not so very long ago since people at home believed in witch who sailed through air to take part in diabolic ceremony brought about death of anyone by sticking pin into little waxen image that even now peasantry in out of way part of country still hold that old woman bewitch cow prevent milk turning into butter however long may continue churning fairy superstition have not quite disappeared belief in ghost be very wide spread when think of that be not surprising that poor ignorant native still have implicit faith in tradition of ancestor be possible that old place be still inhabited by indian who have be guardian for age if not now may have have charge of long after spaniard came here murdered who ventured to approach place know that tradition of gold valley have be faithfully maintained in family of dia may also be case in family to guardianship of old place be entrusted to mind be le likely in case of gold valley there be nothing for in secret to do to hold tongue to supply guardian to place from generation to generation must have be much more irksome task may have be abandoned either from dislike of who have to spend life in such monotonous business by family dying out certainly want to have fight with men who be only following order passed down to for hundred of year if attack will have to fight sincerely trust that may find place deserted for fight fight mean to get treasure if be there must think so bertie agreed treasure be absolutely of use to may be end of use to to of bertie if there be treasure may be sure be large one ample for of to spare of course will have trouble in getting away gold must be invaluable to of rascally adventurer who be curse to peru really want to see place even putting aside question of treasure for must have be extraordinarily well hidden if spaniard never came upon think there can be doubt in respect tradition must be true whole thing must have be upset if spaniard have once paid visit there for from what saw at pachacamac cuzco spared exertion to root out likely hiding place treasure if there be one will be difficult to find have got nearly year yet if necessary will spend whole of in digging dia must go get provision for of course must not always go to same place sometimes can go up to huaura sometimes down to chancay ancon place have told lie mile two south of salina promontory must partly account for escaping notice for road from huaura a see on map skirt foot of hill go straight on to chancay ancon there be earthly reason why anyone must go out to promontory people here leave road travel eight ten mile merely to look at ocean especially when by following straight line must see without trouble well have have hard work during past year what with felling tree to make bridge chopping log for fire making road practicable by moving rock out of way occasionally using pick where dia thought that there be lode carrying mule burden up down steep place altogether have be sort of backwoodsman life if there be treasure vault in place think will be able to get at however thick heavy stone may be on top of be game bertie said there be lot more excitement in working when possibly treasure lie under foot than in chopping away at tree of be so hard a almost to turn edge of axe place can not be very large so wo take very long if be obliged to tear up foot of suppose there can not be above three foot of stone over mouth of of vault think bertie when have once investigated place settled on plan have better send dia jose down to callao to get three four keg of powder boring tool besides supply of provision must get on lot faster with than with only pickax will want couple of strong iron crowbar for lifting slab of stone of course fuse for mine must have to be careful not to put too much powder in so a not to bring whole thing down about ear oh must not want to make mine of sort only to blast stone a do in quarry mine must have to make hole to begin with by mean of pick crowbar in one corner of room two three foot wide then must make couple of hole size of boring tool foot so away according to hardness of ground put in charge fire in way blow down rock into hole have made so must go on until have done whole floor of course bigger hole first make be to say wider face have easier will blow stone down afterwards have watched blasting stone at portland at gallery be making at gibraltar know pretty well how be done of course be hard work driving borer down for will want two three sledge of different weight will make arm ache at first after week two will be able to stick to fairly well now have better turn in will start at daybreak tomorrow will take two hour to reach spot from dia said must see place three hour to get to castle will give long afternoon to take first look over there senor dia said when at eight o'clock in morning stopped on projecting spur of hill be castle from where stood must see that ground fell away into what be at first mere depression gradually deepened into valley half mile wide still farther down side became more precipitous in distance valley be closed in by rock wall appeared to come to end that did not do so be evident from streak of bright green in centre of valley showing that small stream must run down from point at stood must see level line of plateau near cliff facing sea on surface of dark zigzag line marked course of ravine then when apparently close to termination of flat land by cliff dark streak widened out somewhat through small powerful telescope harry carried must make out distinctly upper part of what might be house be strange looking place for castle to be built said quite answer to description dia there be certainly opening may have be window be sure one looking from here ignorant place existed must notice of course from valley must not be seen at even from height think can see more than ten twelve foot of upper part surely must be noticeable to anyone coming along cliff may be senor can not say certainly native must go along there even in daytime still doe seem likely that in spanish time must have ridden along top of cliff if have seen castle must certainly have be searched assuredly have not be so have be at ancon salina many time have talked with people there must never speak on subject to one of white blood knowing be of native blood belonged to one of family to whom secret must be strictly trusted be ready enough to talk about castle of demon have spaniard ever searched must have known place must no longer be feared say that from time of conquest by spaniard living being have a far a be known entered then inca knew of dia think so senor though have not heard that of ever lived there tradition say that vessel in great store of treasure be sent away from pachacamac a be proved by spanish writing be never heard of afterwards doubtless be sunk in great storm came on two three day after sailed be intended to be landed hidden in castle thought might well escape observation of spaniard even among tradition there be allusion to what became of treasure ship senor tradition say that be never heard of from day sailed have landed at castle secret must have be handed down to of native family just a of golden valley of other hidden treasure have be there can be doubt that ship be lost with treasure well need not talk more about now dia will learn nothing more however long stay here stare at stopped hour for breakfast then rode down valley when got near spot where closed in harry saw by pallor on native face that be beginning to be greatly alarmed have better stop here dia brother will go on explore ravine have look at place will take rope with for ravine may be blocked by fall of rock may have to let down evidently water get to sea valley must be lake like in golden ravine for although be mere driblet of water now can see by bank that considerable amount come down in wet season how get past castle know can only suppose that there be passage for underneath building will take gun bertie pistol that there be demon be quite sure place may have be used a hiding place for outlaw brigand who must find better spot a there be fear whatever of being discovered will take bread meat in haversack flask of spirit perhaps will be away longer than expect dia at rate will not stop there after dark tear be in indian eye a harry bertie said good bye to started when saw enter ravine sat down with elbow on knee cried unrestrainedly wife went up to put hand on shoulder sorrow dia a for have fear though love a well a do say that there may not be demon in castle everyone say there be though may strangle people who break order be given that none must go near believe can hurt white friend saw that have fear know how brave be how laughed at idea of demon having power over do think must smile talk if thought be in danger still a there be need to prepare dinner yet will tell bead over over again will know if harm come to if hear fire gun for be certain that must do so even if legion of demon attacked must never run away must fight till last love dia said love a own son at first when came to from senor barriett be for sake consented to accompany aid from night when saved life by rushing with weapon save stick into midst of five men with drawn knife felt how noble be loved not only for sake of life for bravery since then feeling have grown day have not treated a equal a must do people of own race who by peruvian with white blood in vein be looked down upon be true dia have laughed joked with have treated with a much respect a if have be of pure spanish blood have always done everything must to make thing easy for will not believe god holy virgin can permit to be overpowered by evil one must be otherwise must never return must be inconsolable must be to a if have died must be ready to stab to heart at thought that have brought here must not live after maria a say will trust god will protect cut down two rod fastened together in form of cross then wife knelt before repeated innumerable paternoster ave maria crossing a did so jose a soon a have removed burden from mule turned out to graze at edge of streamlet came joined in supplication occasionally breaking off from repetition of only prayer knew in native language imploring saint to protect friend there be humbug about dia bertie said a left others be really in blue funk yes be quite in earnest know that be coward in other matter certainly not showed amount of pluck in affair with indian seems bright sensible sort of chap that be quite funny to hear going on about demon must not be surprised at anything ordinary peasant might believe be different with man like dia know bertie harry said coming to sudden stop think be making mistake going on into ravine have belief that place be inhabited still there may be desperado perhaps few fanatic be quite possible that certain number of family bound to keep watch here formed little community have lasted to present day how must have lived will talk that over bertie if find of there now must turn back be not more than mile at outside to place where can climb hillside in way will be able to look down into ravine take general view of place will know what be doing then whereas if be to go on through gorge without knowing anything about might find caught in trap wo make hour difference for ground up there will be a good walking a be here while might find sort of obstacle in ravine with two gun apiece ammunition pistol coil of rope food so on must find awkward work climbing among heap of rock be saying how must group of people exist here for century without communication with outside world well suppose must might get water from stream possibly there may be way of getting down to sea shore anyhow stream must find passage when be in flood might have be able to get enough fish for want fish water diet must scarcely be sufficient at same time be by mean sure that must have have communication with outside for just a family may have be ordered to live here others may have be instructed to supply with food watcher may have have store of gold dust sufficient to last time friend outside may have brought sheep two corn other article of necessity once week there must have be difficulty in doing so story of demon probably murder of inquisitive people who tried to pry into what be going on created dread of place in secret must come go without slightest difficulty conceivably young men may from time to time have gone out for year into world brought back wife with girl may have be sent by people in league with outside obtained husband be le likely must think be more probable that young boy girl must be kidnapped brought in here from time to time be pure guesswork of course nevertheless there may be people here be just a well to take look round from above before trust inside place on gaining plateau followed crest of valley until came to spot where ravine appeared to end found that in fact made sharp turn be here only ten foot wide soon broadened out to thirty fifty yard there be sharp bend ravine narrowed to twenty foot side became absolutely perpendicular twenty yard farther still saw something like wall about thirty forty foot high stretching across gorge be here seventy foot deep about twenty foot from foot there be steep ascent of rock such a might have fallen there by slip from one side other above perpendicular wall rose for twenty five foot harry brother looked at in surprise from height at stood appearance be precisely that of wall precipice on side be rough uneven must see sign of joint look a if be natural bertie said ca be must certainly be artificial be wonderful imitation certainly anyone coming up ravine must suppose that bank of rock at foot have fallen from face know that ca be that for water make way through besides see be only three foot wide at top then there be narrow ledge couple of foot wide be evidently made for garrison to stand upon shoot arrow at anyone attempting to come up ravine behind slope be rough rock except just below foot where there be narrow stone staircase of regularly cut step be so narrow that must not be noticed by anyone standing here unless bent over to look straight down a be doing well be just a well that made circuit for certainly must not have climbed over there sharp turn ravine ran straight towards castle hurried on when have gone fifty yard stood at edge of roughly circular pit be seventy eighty foot across narrowing at end at one end be ravine at whose mouth be standing directly opposite in what might be called neck of bottle stood castle of demon be fifty foot in width a stood back about forty foot up neck must hardly be seen at point except at be standing there be door other opening at le than twenty five foot from ground at height be broad aperture about four foot high twelve wide above be several smaller opening about four foot square singular point in structure be rough arch of rock extended above formed roof arch projected thirty forty foot in front of building so that latter have appearance of standing in great cave what extraordinary looking place bertie said in low voice extraordinary how splendidly chosen for concealment see top of rock above be level with ground on side must perfectly well account for people riding along line of cliff passing over without dreaming that there be house below even if went to edge on side must simply see deep pit ravine beyond must not by possibility obtain sight of house unless came round to nearly where be standing must have possible motive for doing besides see way have be passing through thick bush have doubt that in old time wood stood here possibly planted by builder of house of course arch existed before house be built stratum below be probably softer stream gradually trickled through perhaps in great flood when basin be full burst way out after rock gradually fell until formed that great natural arch well let go round have look at other side found that width of arch to sea cliff be hundred fifty foot if castle extends to face bertie be hundred foot across from here ca see whether doe so be probably built flush however a dia said that be not noticeable from sea have arch projected beyond must certainly have be seen well harry if will tie rope round waist can let down will have look at can hold easily enough if stand twenty foot back from edge wo have to pull up because can easily climb up rope by need not go down more than thirty forty foot can do easily enough oh must pull up bertie well must do that if by chance must get tired then must give shout must haul on rope there be lot of stump of tree here bertie can take turn round one of so let down easily then when shout will fasten rope there come to edge can hear whether want to haul not of course must depend whether there be jagged rock sticking out if so must be better for to climb a rope might chafe against if pulled understand bertie laid down weapon water flask made loop at end of one of rope have brought large enough for to sit in then looked for spot where short grass extended to very edge be good place rope wo chafe a run over now be ready if will go back to stump fifteen foot away let out gradually will be off knelt down putting rope over head took firm hold of just above loop then crawled backwards brother keeping rope taut slack out gradually now bertie said be just over directly afterwards shoulder disappeared harry let rope slowly out until calculated that fifty foot be over cliff then fastened very securely round stump went forward to edge be right bertie shouted quite right face of rock be very even there be nothing for rope to chafe against harry lay down at edge keeping firm hold of rope to prevent from slipping over be able to look down on bertie well bertie what be be wall of house have doubt be so cleverly built that can scarcely see where arch end house begin looking quite close can see where stone join face have be left rough a be just same colour a rock line have be cut down face crack made across answering to line in rock on side be sure must not have known be built up unless have examined be much narrower on side than on other not more than twenty five foot must say there seem to be irregularly shaped hole in what look like fissure in middle suppose be to light room on side of house be certainly too small to be noticed from sea doe sea come right up to foot of cliff be minute before answer came water come to foot there be line of rock running along forty fifty foot farther out of seem to be thirty foot out of water at one end touch cliff at other there be free passage water be very clear a far a can judge must say there be depth of fathom fathom half between rock cliff certainly boat must row in to position underneath where be be there anything more see entrance down here all right then may a well come up again can climb up easily well hail if want to haul harry went back to stump unwound rope until be only turn round then holding firmly stood ready to haul up chapter xv investigation harry be relieved when few minute later bertie head appeared above edge directly afterwards crawled over arm have strengthened ever so much with work must have done before must have be hard work well so far so good bertie there be doubt that be one of best hiding place in world be not bit surprised that spaniard never found now will go back to edge of ravine have good look from side a went along said let have look at bush bertie soil be very thin about here wonder that tree grew be pine bertie said in mountain often saw pine growing among rock where there did not seem handful of soil for on examining found several old stump thrusting ramrod down harry found to surprise that soil be from three to four foot deep tried again little farther off found that be two foot further still be only one tree must have stood in hole in rock said try one bertie same result be obtained that explains bert evidently when planted tree to prevent place from being seen from hill cut away rock in circle about twelve foot across made cup shaped hole filled up with earth when planted young tree dare say at first watered must easily enough fetch water up from stream when tree got fairly rooted must be able to leave alone perhaps giving good watering once two three month whenever rain came must be able to give up watering altogether for in basin earth must keep moist for very long time must be big job doubt king who built place have tribe at work on be probable that inca have established at cuzco for many year before came down to place tree may not have be planted till coming be first heard of in case there must be plenty of time to hide place before came down searched shore know that chimoos resisted for considerable time before be finally conquered well for purpose place be built be one in chimoos inca if ever found place must be likely to hide treasure be satisfactory now will sit down here for short time watch window look at two top line bertie will look at two lower line certainly see sign of life be how water get out pointed to roughly shaped arch about twelve foot wide a many high through little stream disappeared expect there be similar passage at other end there may have be bertie said be hanging so close to wall that there may very well have be one without being able to see look pitch dark in there if there be much of opening ought to see light for a agreed ca be more than hundred foot long illustration harry dropped barrel of rifle into palm of left hand be first place will investigate bertie question of how be to get into house want thinking over lowest window be good twenty five foot above ground of course if have grapnel must fasten to end of rope chuck in will have to make something of sort if window have be on other side instead of must have be easy enough because must have lowered slipped down rope afterwards that arch sticking out so far on side make impossible that can do now be a far a can see to lower down on to top of wall in ravine then go examine tunnel have got plenty of rope to lower from here on to wall watched building for twenty minute be convinced that one be there harry said have not seen a much a shadow pas of window since if people did live in must naturally be on side of house because room here be better lighted more cheerful doubt be principal room a house narrow so much at other end well let try bertie said if there be strong force here must only have to make bolt back to narrow staircase must hold against whole tribe rose walked along edge of ravine till be above wall then fastening rope to stump slid down on to so far so good harry said a holding rifle in hand went down step then suddenly stopped hullo exclaimed here be two skeleton be not quite skeleton for bone be covered by parchment like skin there be still remains of short skirt have worn in life spear lay beside with difficulty brother passed down without treading upon must have be here long time harry bertie said when got to bottom time other said in dry air of low land there be scarce decay remember mummy saw believe iron steel will lie here for year without rusting may have be here for couple of hundred year more wonder what killed harry have idea see one be lying almost on other with arm round body a if have died trying to lift up if have be shot by arrow must still be sticking into if have be killed by people pursuing must probably be lying upon back for must naturally have faced round at last moment to resist pursuer whereas there be sign of injury settle point that there be one in house have be inhabited body must have be removed from path for be by people must go out return there may have be ladder down from wall only other way must have got out must have be through passage to sea boat may have be kept there even if have be so must scarcely have found body on step well will have plenty of time to talk over walked across open space until approached building for height of twenty foot be constructed of stone above that appeared to be made of great adobe brick have be so largely used at pachacamac in others of old ruin have seen there be question that must have be built by chimoos race before harry said inca must have have possible reason for erecting place well now for tunnel little stream only occupied two foot of passage be therefore enabled to walk down dry foot ought to have brought torch with bertie said think will want that there be sort of thin blue light reflection of light upon water outside though know why must be so blue reason be soon manifest passage sloped downwards when have gone fifty foot progress be arrested by water appeared of deep blue colour be harry said see roof come down into water twenty foot off light have come up under sloped passage to make water flow out below surface of sea so that opening must not be seen from without by light must not say that opening be more than six inch under water know how tide be if be high tide now top of opening must be eighteen inch out of water at low tide for a know tide only rise about two foot on coast in case boat must be able to come in out at low tide of course man wanting to come in go out must easily dive under at time well settle that point for present be clever plan amount of water must flow out in flood time yet one who took trouble to come behind ledge of rock saw must have idea that there be opening think now that have better go back bertie in first place because can hing until have manufactured grapnel of sort in next place because moment delay will add to anxiety of friend in camp must have be away three hour must say ascended step fastened short rope round block at top of wall across ravine lowered down have to proceed with great care while making way down slope composed of rough jagged rock once at bottom of ravine however walked briskly on have scarcely issued from entrance when saw stir in camp in distance heard shout of delight then dia dashed off to meet at top of speed thanks to saint senor that be safe know how have suffered have prayed ever since started of once twice threw down in despair maria chided for having so little faith in god to keep from evil cheered by saying that have harm come to must assuredly have heard sound of gun have be in castle dia have not be in for good reason that must not get in because only entrance be fully twenty five foot from ground can not enter until have made contrivance by rope can be fixed there manufactured ladder must be best way save lot of trouble if must get couple of pole long enough thought that must come back when have seen all there be to be seen outside place indian face fell then know what be in house senor be certain that there be one there that probably one have be there for past two hundred year perhaps good deal longer demon have not interfered with demon knew better bertie laughed may not be powerful in daytime dia said in awed tone be at night that must be terrible well dia bertie said everyone know that demon can not withstand sign of cross have to do be to make small cross hold up in front of say 'vade retro satanas will fly howling away seriously harry said know be bosh about demon dia church exorcises evil spirit have seen priest go with candle incense to haunted house drive out evil spirit there be to say dia spirit be ever seen there afterwards may be very certain that spirit be ever seen there before though cowardly people might have fancied saw however to morrow will get inside bertie will stop there night if neither see hear anything of may be quite sure that there be none there tradition say have strangled many torn senor body have be found in daytime carried off be quite possible that be strangled torn there may be sure that be work not of demon of men who be set to guard place from intruder well men have gone found two skeleton must have be there at least hundred year perhaps great deal more be lying on stair only way of getting into place must have be removed long ago if anyone have be passing in out by time have arrived at camp knew must come back safe senor donna maria said triumphantly told dia so over over again what have seen see something now rather see something now must like to see bertie laughed thought must have got good dinner ready for see sign of being even begun woman laughed have be too busy praying senor have be keeping up dia spirit never knew faint hearted before really almost frightened will set about getting dinner at once harry said be really not hungry have good meal before started so do three sit down will tell have seen three native listened with intense interest when have done maria clapped hand must be wonderful place said wish have gone with will go to morrow if will take certainly will take maria have doubt that dia will go too will go a far a place said dia will not promise to go in wo press dia when have slept there night have doubt will become convinced that be quite safe now about ladder will really want two to be comfortable one for getting up to window must be made of wood other will be used for getting up down wall in ravine may be made of rope think that have best be hung from top of ravine above so a to avoid having to climb over rough stone at foot be really very awkward one might very well twist one ankle among will go at once senor get pole dia said may a well come with jose passed wood in valley about five mile off there can cut down couple of young tree if put saddle on two of riding mule when have got pole clear can fasten end to rope trail behind will also want of branch cut off dia have better say thirty length of about two foot long so that may place rung nine inch apart have better get pole thirty foot long for may not have just height by couple of foot two native at once rode off brother set to work to collect stick for fire be too bad senor that must not have be done while be away thought of nothing danger be perfectly right maria if be in peril did best thing of to obtain help for a to dinner there be hurry for have got to eat there be nothing senor few of fish fried two day ago ham that smoked of bear will take line then go down try to catch fresh fish bertie said there be good sized pool about way between here ravine might get fish there will take gun bertie go up to bush by ravine see if can get bird two there be other shelter anywhere about here in hour lad brought dozen fish into camp none of be above pound be nearly of size will be very nice woman said with smile a handed to have thrown away others think dried enough be certainly going bad have heard brother fire several time a doe not often miss have doubt will bring something twenty minute later harry be seen coming along when arrived threw down large bunch of wild pigeon there be ten brace said that will give four apiece found nothing in bush suddenly remembered that when went across from ravine to house lot of wild pigeon rose from side of rock did not give thought at time attention being fixed upon building when got nothing above suddenly remembered concluded that have nest in cranny of rock so walked along to top a did so number of flew up shot couple most of others soon settled again kept flying round round in ten minute got a many a wanted then of course have to go down into ravine by rope step to gather up returned way did by rope have left hanging from top of wall maria be already at work on bird taking by leg dipped for minute into pot of boiling water a took out bertie pulled off feather then cut off head foot cleaned spitted on jose ramrod raking out line of ember from fire laid end of ramrod on two forked twig while attended to fish will be done before others arrive bertie said senor there come will be here in quarter of hour cake be ready hot so will lay pigeon on will be nicely flavoured by time that have eaten fish be ready for dia jose soon arrived at gallop with long pole trailing behind fagot of short stick fastened to saddle be capital pole dia harry said a examined strong enough for anything will chop notch in for rung to lie in there will be fear then of shifting might do if lashing stretched now have got capital dinner just done to turn so see have not be lazy while be away see said after have finished breakfast shooting have quite settled point that indian be in castle if there have be must certainly have come to window to see who be firing kept eye on castle between shot saw sign of movement be capital thing so many pigeon live among rock if content with say five brace day will last long time will be change from salt dried meat must otherwise have to depend upon for can not be sending away for fresh meat two three time week can get fish though suppose will last very long for pool will soon be fished out think that there be water enough in other place for fish of size can get from sea harry have got plenty of large hook line used on other side of mountain if of window opening on side be large enough can let down line from there if not can do from top where went down must not like harry said one might slip on short grass well one must dive out through passage sit on ledge of rock fish inside in sea outside yes might do bertie certainly must be first rate thing if must get plenty of fish must keep in good health make nice change think to morrow morning dia have better fix camp close up to mouth of ravine out here in open valley can be seen from hill if anyone caught sight of animal must very soon get talked about must have party down here to see who be what be about yes senor must be much better must not have liked to go nearer morning now that have be there twice have returned safely be ready to move must certainly be better besides must save couple of mile walk time wanted meal however when once set to work have doubt will establish in castle of course one of will come down morning evening to see to animal a soon a meal be finished set to work to make ladder short stick be cut a guide to space be to be left between rung bertie jose marked off distance on two pole dia harry with ax cut groove in stick be to lie then pole be laid foot apart work of pressing stick into place began agreed that rope must not be cut up a must be wanted for fastening on load whenever mule went to fetch food powder two of head rope be used on side firm job be made when go dia for powder so on must get supply of rope will want longer ladder than in ravine also rope to lift powder firewood so on into castle perhaps for other thing one doe not think of at present tomorrow will unfasten cord by descended to wall a will not want to use that in future think to morrow when go to castle a jose mean to accompany might take ax cut down lot of stump among brushwood split up pitch into courtyard of castle must be well to lay in good stock of firewood will want for cooking lighting of evening have only one two torch left will want cheerful fire may go with to morrow may not maria said certainly may if wish must like to said in company sha' be bit afraid of demon want to see place be right maria show at rate that curiosity be stronger than superstition if maria go will go dia said like if went did must never hear last of very well harry said with laugh do think must have better of in future if did so see will be conquering superstition because curiosity be greater because be more afraid of tongue than be of demon woman never forgets senor if once have something to throw up in man teeth come out whenever be angry suppose so dia bertie have have experience way will take word for next morning moved mule belonging to extreme end of valley then have early breakfast jose took up axe others arm former turned back for point where must climb hill dia harry took heavy end of ladder bertie light one started up ravine maria followed with store of bread that have baked day before be hard work carrying ladder up rock at foot of wall when be securely fastened there mounted dragged up to when came out into open space there be pause be a said strange place senor be dia extraordinary place if people who built wanted a suppose did to avoid observation must not have chosen better when tree be growing must have be impossible to catch sight of without coming down ravine look very still dia said in doubtful voice be generally case when place be empty dia now let go on at once get ladder up a soon a ladder be in position harry mounted closely followed by bertie dia hesitated merry laugh from wife settled point followed with expression of grave determination on face a soon a be on ladder wife followed with light step a harry reached top found that sill of window be two foot half above floor of apartment stepped down then looked round room occupied whole width of house be twenty foot wide four row of pillar ran across supporting roof above end of room be in semi darkness be not above ten foot in height there be rude carving on pillar wall by time have made observation others have joined see people there dia said in awed voice pointing to one end of room harry dropped barrel of rifle into palm of left hand after gazing two second placed on shoulder saying there be people dia wo do harm walked in direction two figure lay on ground four others be in sitting position close to other against end wall bow arrow spear lay near be dressed in garment of rough cloth harry walked up to one touched on head with muzzle of gun a did so crumbled away bone rattled on stone floor a fell donna maria gave little cry be dead exclaimed must have be dead year year ago two three hundred must think legend be evidently true dia there be party left here to keep stranger from entering place now before go farther let think out will sit down on ledge of window before do so take good look at arm skull dia have often be with traveller to ruin let hear what say dia who be now assured that have only to deal with human being examined carefully looking at ornament still hung round neck then said be not old people senor be inca be important point now let see how be to be explained now said a sat down be clear that inca did know building may have discovered treasure here may not must certainly seem that be a anxious a chimoos have be to keep existence secret be certain that must have have interest in doing so have reason to believe that spaniard at least did not know of there be doubt that men be not killed in fight on contrary sitting position prof that died quietly probably at same time see sign of food may find a search place if must take that died from outbreak of epidemic from hunger be quite probable that two skeleton on step be two of companion who be going out to seek for food that fell from weakness one clearly died in act of trying to lift other what do think of dia think that what say be likely why must have died from hunger be probable that others be in secret be in habit of bringing provision to perhaps of relieving at certain period know that there be fierce battle in early time of spaniard in one of battle whole of who be acquainted with secret may have fallen may have be earlier after conquest have be completed when spaniard drove ten of thousand of men to work a slave in mine people here may have remained at post hoping for relief until be too late two of strongest may have started at last have be too weak to climb step died there comrade may have never known fate have sat down to die here a see must think probable that second of suggestion be likely to be right one that did not take place until perhaps hundred year after arrival of spaniard otherwise legend of men who came near place being killed must never have be handed down if be a suggest inca knew that chimoos have buried treasure here buried although a say there be tradition of treasure having be taken here be possible that treasure ship undoubtedly sailed from place along coast be never again heard of really came here that treasure be landed vessel then destroyed in case there be strong reason for hope that there be treasure somewhere in castle if can find will find bertie said confidently what say must be true indian must never have be fool enough to sit here die without good reason for well vote that before do anything else clear bone out can do that first thing to morrow morning bertie ca just throw out of window bone be of men who died doing duty to country will leave a be to day to morrow will bring up one of big leather bag place bone in take down into valley bury then wo sleep here to night harry have not shadow of superstition think must be lively here with thing at end of room now let look about bit be evidently great hall of place do not think so dia yes senor house get narrower a nears sea be by far best lighted room on side doubt room on floor be abode of chief who built principal follower others must be above well will light two torch yes there be doubt that be room see there be bracket against pillar for holding torch before go farther will see what be made of took knife out of pocket went up to one of bracket consisted of bar of metal inch half square eighteen inch long widened out at end here be round hole about two inch in diameter evidently intended to put torch in metal be black with age scraped few inch off one of with knife silver exclaimed must have be better if have be gold a there be four on pillar twelve pillar must make tidy weight be good beginning bertie if be same in room there must be several ton of there be one door to room through passed dia now that there be explanation for what considered work of demon have more assured air one passage led straight on two others ran parallel to wall of room have left will examine first harry said be likely enough lead to stair to lower room there must be two floor below one above level of top of tunnel other below must be divided in two by a advanced into passage there be strange sudden clamour roaring sound mingled with sharp shriek strange little piping squeak maria ran back with shriek of alarm there be strange rush overhead torch be extinguished harry brother discharged rifle almost at same moment dia burst into shout of laughter a dropped weapon swung double barrelled gun forward what on earth be dia be bat bird senor have seen come out of cave way many time dare say place be full of bat bird must only come into room where there be light turning round saw quite cloud of bat flying out through door confound harry said have given worst fright ever have in life went back to room have left harry bertie have lost tinge of colour from face be very glad harry bertie said with attempt at laugh that be frightened be scared almost out of life maria have thrown down on face ah senor dia said triumphantly thought be demon did not think be demon dia what be must not tell never heard such sound before be not ashamed to say that did feel badly frightened now see to wife dia there be nothing to be afraid of maria be lying there for woman raised slightly be alive said in dazed way alive of course be suppose be going to be frightened at lot of bat there look at be still streaming out be all right maria harry said have have fright so have bertie so need not be ashamed of be very well for dia to laugh say have seen such thing before if be afraid senor need not be ashamed be really did think be demon there be such thing maria be a good imitation of a be ever likely to see be in horrible funk maria bertie said be only just getting over feel be quite a pale a be looking so pleased about dia asked almost angrily be pleased senor now have got even with maria first time say to 'demons will say to 'bats now let start again harry said a laughed instead of going down will go upstairs have not pulled quite together yet suppose have knee be quite wobbling about if saw anything certainly must not aim straight just at present be rum have main mast struck by lightning off cape one voyage made did not feel bit like dare say not bertie feel brave in danger that be accustomed to be what know frightens will sit here on window sill for five minute before move again jose have got pulque in gourd suppose yes senor then will take drink of like stuff just at present feel that wo come amiss at of spirit be poured into tin mug have with mixed with water with have filled water bottle from stream before starting chapter xvi search begin in few minute be ready to go on again harry have asked maria if must like to go down ladder wait till returned senor must not like at care how full of bat room be now that know what be a for dia have doubt that first time heard be just a frightened be not dare say must have be if man be with be then only about jose age have not told that cavern be full of bat there be great storm coming on proposed that must take shelter there brought mule into mouth of cave said 'now will light torch go in bit farther then will be astonished be bat cavern have doubt there be thousand of here wo hurt though may knock out torch noise make be enough to scare one out of one sens if one doe not know what be ' though did know own be frightened bit since then have be into several such cave so knew in moment what be ought to have warned senor for old house like where there be very little light be just place for there be bird too dia yes expect be nearer perhaps of be in other room where must be close to opening be probably scared too by noise of bat a window behind be too small for to fly out together made for light instead well now let start harry said getting up again lit torch time found everything perfectly quiet in passage two three yard beyond spot at have before arrived saw staircase to left be faintly lighted from above mounting found in room extending over whole width depth of house roof at eastern end be not supported by pillar by wall three foot wide seven eight foot apart first line of be evidently over wall of room have left there be four line of similar support erected have doubt over wall of room below light from four window in front from irregular opening at other end three foot high six inch wide afforded sufficient light for to move about without difficulty there be many sign of human habitation here along side be remains of mat have apparently divided space six foot wide into small apartment turning over found many trifle arrow head bead necklace fragment of pot even child doll expect be room where married troop lived slept harry said there be not much to see here two story above be exactly similar except that there be remains of dividing mat of female ornament walked to narrow end here opening for light be of different shape from in room below have apparently be originally of same shape have be altered in middle be like others three foot high six inch wide foot from bottom there be wide cut foot high three foot wide a approached dia gave exclamation of surprise two skeleton lay below must have be on watch here senor when died said a came up to be rum place to watch bertie said for can not see out be right bertie be curious hole wall be over two foot thick other opening have be driven straight through a have noticed be doubtless made in stone before be placed there for inside be cleanly cut be only within three inch of outer face that edge have be left rough opening be of quite different character sloped at sharp angle view of open sea must be obtained only one of line of rock at foot of cliff be roughly made by mark of tool probably of hardened copper have evidently be cut from inside harry stood looking for time can not understand cutting hole like must not be noticed from sea that there be opening at be plain enough why make hole at when can see nothing from yet watch have be placed here while there be none at other place where must make out passing ship perhaps bertie said be done in order that if from other place boat be seen approaching must chuck big stone down from here sink boat might row inside rock into entrance to passage a be in middle of room must be just under in case must have kept supply of big stone here have doubt that be made time after castle be built must say judging by unfinished state work be done in haste what for goodness only know well now having made discovery on upper floor will go down be certain that there can be great treasure hidden under of floor there be not depth enough for hiding place counted step a came upstairs there can not be much more than two foot between floor of one room ceiling in next fancy that be of single stone flooring length of space between half wall see that there be long beam of stone running on top of dividing wall end of stone appear to rest on be below must look for hiding place descended to first floor found that space behind great room be divided into number of chamber of with exception of small one on sea face be necessarily in absolute darkness in be bracket for torch similar to in principal chamber bertie counted found that including first met with numbered one hundred twenty three how much do think weigh apiece asked harry when tour be finished have not slightest idea bertie must think about fifteen pound may be five pound le than that must certainly give very nasty knock on head oh be not thinking of knock on head if there be hundred bar at fifteen pound apiece be big amount of silver if be only ten pound really think be mark weigh thousand pound what be silver worth pound varies can put at five shilling ounce must be three pound sterling for one of silver three thousand pound in rough calculation for lot well be not bad beginning harry must pay expense leave couple of thousand over harry shrugged shoulder drop in ocean a far a be concerned bertie still be beginning may be sure that did not take trouble to guard castle for sake of three thousand pound worth of silver now went down to next floor here there be two staircase space be divided into two part by wall along centre there be opening for light one half have evidently be devoted to arm here still lay hundred of spear shaft ten of thousand of arrow pile of hide shield cap of same material store must have be larger than be required for garrison of place harry said must have be reserve for re arming whole tribe besides arm there be great bale of rough cloth pile of skin in marvellous state of preservation owing to dryness of air after thoroughly examining room went up stair leading into descended into adjoining chamber be divided into compartment by transverse wall four foot shorter than width thereby leaving passage through from end to end here in confusion for most part turned inside out be sack of matting bag of leather one of compartment be filled with great jar arranged in tier of compartment be quite empty think senor that be store of loose grain probably maize see single grain left looked carefully round with torch carry out idea dia that people upstairs died of hunger have doubt a say that sack did contain grain if have be cleared in ordinary way there must certainly remain good deal loosely scattered about might have be full half full at time place be left a found possibly instead of ten men garrison may have be ten time a strong at first in fifty hundred year before last survivor died may have dwindled to tenth of number however be plain that a say store of food be not carried away be consumed to last grain in same way can see by way sack bag be tumbled about turned inside out how careful be search for remnant might have be overlooked when be first emptied point to starvation three of largest division bore evident trace at time other animal probably llama vicuna have be closely penned there have be occupied by store of hay of still remained when have thoroughly examined room harry looked at watch said be late in afternoon torch be nearly finished however there be time for casual look round at cellar below to morrow will begin regular search there descended by staircase to basement how narrow place be bertie exclaimed be not much more than width of room above of course be not two room above occupied whole width of house only occupy width between passage rock wall on side see tunnel be twelve foot wide may take that wall be at least three foot thick be not a if have be built of brick even of stone cut to shape knew nothing of arch a saw outside came up nearly to point stone be longer longer with course projecting over one below until when be within two foot of joining very long slab be laid across stone may be three foot wide at bottom ten foot at top see wall extends over here in same way a of course must have done otherwise whole thing must have overbalanced fallen in before slab at top be added so see there be width of tunnel twelve foot two wall say six foot more to be taken off fifty foot so cellar by side of passage can only be about sixteen foot half at end be what seem to be will go away to nothing at other end a will see presently first thing saw be sunken tank in floor be full of water be about four foot square on sounding with one of ramrod found be about same in depth water coming to within foot of top be against wall facing ravine must have connection with stream otherwise must have be dry long ago did not see hole when went down passage bertie said most likely hole something like be cut in rock outside pipe driven to bottom of cistern must only have to fill one in tunnel with cut block to within foot of surface with smaller stone to same level a bed of stream then water in cistern must always be level with outside put in end so a to be well out of reach of salt water farther in be fool who built place however closely be besieged even if enemy occupied space in front of house water supply be secure in time of flood harry if water rose foot in passage saw did more than that must flood whole of basement be so bertie may be sure that there be provision against that must have valve that must shut possibly there be block of wood covered with leather that must push into pipe at bottom of cistern beyond considerable store of firewood in large small block nothing must be seen in chamber expect two place be used a prison harry said though in case very large force be assembled may have slept here at ordinary time upper room must be quite sufficient see have to build whole height of rocky arch wanted entrance to place to be so far above ground level that must be extremely difficult for enemy to climb into hostile force must only have come in at entrance small body of determined men might have held against host lower chamber be simply cellar store room be above habitable part of castle now let look at chamber on other side doubt will find just like proved to be case there be cistern more pile of firewood otherwise be empty after short survey returned to main chamber bringing up with two of empty leather bag in placed bone of dead remains crumbling when touched a first skeleton have done bag be lowered to ground four searcher descended carried to mouth of ravine in spare bag brought with placed bone of two skeleton on step then carried out to open valley will bury when move camp down here to morrow morning harry said forgot two up at window be matter can throw out to morrow will lie a well at bottom of sea a in earth here not much be said a returned to castle have be very silent party day gloom darkness way in voice echoed in empty hall have exercised depressing effect on donna maria generally most talkative of party have not quite recovered from shock exit of bat have given be not until have cooked meal sat down to that quite recovered spirit have found jose awaiting return have blazing fire having brought down a much firewood a must carry dia have briefly told result of exploration well harry what do think altogether bertie asked after meal be over think ought to be very well satisfied replied everything have borne out idea have castle may have be built a fortress by great chief certainly before time of inca may have be used for prison ornament thing found showed that be known to inca must have have occasion to use when be undisputed master of country when trouble came with spaniard garrison be placed here possibly of chief took refuge in place then came time when opposition to invader ceased only small body of men be left here to guard secret treasure if there be generation may have passed before last of garrison died of hunger probably others who be in secret fell in insurrection died in mine seems plain enough except possibly there be treasure left by chimoos may have be discovered by inca must think extremely likely that ship dia mentioned a setting out with large amount of treasure be intended to land store here may have done so may have sunk at sea be inclined to think that be lost because tradition concerning hidden treasure seem to be extremely accurate yet a dia say none tell of inca treasure being concealed here however be quite possible that treasure did come here be landed that ship be then broken up so that might be supposed be lost at sea that be kept so profound secret by men here that news be never generally known even among native so far search to day have be successful see that hunt for treasure will be very difficult one certainly in upper chamber there doe appear possibility of such hiding place existing whole space be accounted for wall be of solid stone have special thickness if roof have be arched there might be empty space on side of spring of arch be supported by pillar wall with only just space between floor for beam of solid stone of course be in lowest room that one must expect to find hiding place like saw at pachacamac paused well why must not be there harry because a saw floor be at most twelve inch above water level how be possible that must have constructed chamber below level be in bed of torrent be probable that solid rock lie many foot below bed of stream portion of great arch must from time to time have fallen into may be that river once ran forty fifty foot below present level in place that have seen treasure chamber be formed in solid adobe foundation a temple always stood on artificial terrace with appliance at present time must be next to impossible to sink in stratum of great rock fragment below water level believe that old people here must have done so even have be solid rock difficulty of excavating chamber in must have be enormous must split rock with grain stone wall have seen be made of regular piece evidently formed of stone so split be able to give sort of facing with great labour tool have be not made of material hard enough to work in solid rock labour of excavating such chamber must have be stupendous therefore be at loss to imagine where such chamber can be in castle dia nodded gravely have be with traveller who have done great deal of excavation be able to understand harry argument maria who be listening attentively also understood jose simply rolled cigarette smoked be matter for elder did not even try to follow what harry be saying there be minute silence then bertie said floor be even what do mean bertie harry asked in puzzled tone mean harry that run straight along there be dip in of course there be who ever heard of building floor on slope yes be what mean know that tunnel slope down own height be twelve foot high at entrance at lower end be inch below level so fall twelve foot at least at end where cistern be floor of basement be only few inch above bottom of passage therefore at other end must be twelve foot above water level be right bertie harry exclaimed what fool be not to think of there must be space underneath hundred foot long sloping from nothing down to twelve foot there be room for dozen chamber such a saw on side of tunnel well done bertie have given fresh hope must be splendid hiding place for searcher who came down saw water in cistern must believe at once that a chimoos inca must have known how to build under water there be use in searching for hidden chamber under floor see of have knowledge of cement mortar brick stone be laid without anything of sort amount of labour be available chamber must be made under water for a fast a hole be dug water must come in even if must line with stone work water must penetrate through crack now dia that see with certainty where have to dig can make preparation will write down list of thing decided other day must want six keg of powder two hundred foot of fuse four boring tool six steel wedge smallest smith fire can buy for will have to sharpen tool six borer large bundle of torch four sledge hammer have enough pickax shovel fifty fathom be hundred yard of rope know anything else that will want in mining way wife have better settle what provision must get will certainly need good supply of flour couple of sack must think tea coffee sugar dried salted meat might get supply of smoked fish have doubt that will catch fresh fish here in sea will be too busy to spend much time on that have better get three four gallon of pulque one can not be always drinking coffee have still got good stock of whisky brandy wife will certainly want good supply of red pepper other thing for stew must not be bad thing to have couple of crate of poultry pack too closely half of will be smothered before get here dead meat must be of use for wo keep in heat can turn out in courtyard in front of castle can pick up living there among lower slope of cliff can give few handful of grain day get too many cock let hen be young one ought to supply with plenty of egg brood of chicken must calculate what weight will be take mule accordingly very well senor need not be away more than three day at most be only about twenty mile to ancon might take two llama down with sell there have done good work must not like to kill eat so mind sell to someone who want for carriage work will not require more for purpose will want to take jose with think not senor for must say that four baggage mule will be ample can lead certainly will find jose useful here dia wife then withdrew short distance from fire engaged in animated conversation a to thing required stint matter harry said raising voice may be here for next two three month le frequently have to go down to buy thing better must be easy to account for first purchase by saying that be going on expedition to mountain must not go to place with same story again there be other place can go to senor will get good store of everything time dia started at daybreak with four mule two llama others rolled up tent bed remaining store loaded up other mule moved down to mouth of ravine here pitched little tent again will form central point for mule to come to harry said will leave sack of maize here give animal good feed now will be sure to keep close to spot other thing will carry into castle before start will bury bag of bone when be done saddle taken off piled together against rock other thing be made up in portable packet started up ravine made three journey before everything be brought to foot of ladder leading up to window then two brother mounted hauled thing up with rope jose who remained below fastened to when last be up went to foot of rock brought several armful of wood have thrown down on previous day be also hauled up have better fetch more jose mean to keep big fire burning here night day will make place cheerful will have fire also burning where be at work below now senora will rig up blanket on line between pillar at end of room opposite to in found skeleton so a to make special apartment for dia will spread bed at night near fire screen be soon made cord be run from wall to pillar next to five foot above floor three blanket be sufficient to fill space harry be about to make line from pillar when maria said must rather not senor be not bit afraid screen be quite large enough will be more cheerful not to be shut up altogether a then when be lying down can see reflection of fire on wall will be much more cheerful then blazing fire be lit wood be almost a dry a tinder burnt without smoke be built almost touching back wall in five foot above fire harry with pick made hole four inch deep while be doing jose went down cut sapling four inch in diameter growing in cleft on rock from cut off two six foot length brought up one end of thickest of be driven into hole tightly wedged in there other end be lashed securely to upright beam there maria said when be finished will be able to hang pot kettle from at height like above fire now can set to work a soon a like to get breakfast for have be at work for four five hour have good appetite have cake ready to bake senor sha' be long before get olla ready for well jose what do think of place harry asked must like better if be not so big lad said will want broom senor to sweep out dust be three inch deep maria said must not bother about maria must be tremendous job to sweep big room dust be so fine that must settle again cover everything besides will be good deal softer to lay bed on than stone must be so think have better let remain a be especially a be fond of going about without shoe think will rig up blanket against doorway will make place look good deal more snug will keep bat from returning be not afraid of bat now know what be must be constantly expecting to rush out again expect good many went back last night harry said wo put blanket up till after dark be sure to come out again then a soon a have gone will close wo be able to get in when come back before daybreak harry expectation be fulfilled at dusk stream of bat rushed out again time quite noiselessly rush lasted for three four minute a soon a have gone blanket be hung up fastened across doorway will be puzzled when come back yes senor maria said when find that ca get in here will come in through opening above so will did not think of when once find that can not get out here in evening will go out where came in will have more trouble with know whether be good to eat maria gave little cry of horror oh senor must not eat such horrible thing appearance be against maria when people eat alligator frog snake even rat see why bat must be bad however wo touch unless be threatened by starvation must indeed be starving before must touch bat flesh senor well harry said if people eat monkey rat squirrel seems to that bat be something of mixture of three one might certainly eat bat if be driven to must not mind trying promise wo ask to cook chatted for hour then maria went off to corner brother spread bed by fire jose have blanket poncho be arranged that of who woke must put fresh log on fire be roused just before dawn by squeaking twittering noise threw on fresh log a blazed up must see cloud of bat flying overhead kept on going to doorway when found must not get through retired with angry squeak light be gradually breaking in few minute have flown out through opening harry brother followed must see flitting about upper window presently a if by common impulse poured in through various opening suppose will see more of harry said own that will be glad there be something very weird in noiseless flitting about in shadow fire cast on ceiling be great deal larger than bat have seen bertie said have seen a large larger at bombay of town on coast bite people toe when be asleep yes great vampire bat doe have never heard of others doing so live on insect of be believe vegetarian be vampire bat found here think so fancy that inhabit java other island in malay archipelago however be certainly rare wherever come from can dismiss altogether from mind be glad when heard voice senor maria said when appeared quarter of hour later knew must not hurt be horribly frightened wrapped up in blanket lay there till heard talking heard log thrown on fire then felt that be all right suppose will come again maria after drinking cup of coffee with small piece of maize cake bertie said what be programme for to day ca do much till dia come back may a well go down have look at lower room think there be much dust on floor there while jose be away looking after mule will cut enough bush to make couple of broom will want place swept a clean a possible so that can look about think there be least chance of being able to move stone before do anything will go down to pool have swim dive out through entrance have look at rock be right bertie said be longing for one yesterday morning of course first thing to be done be to examine place must be safe for to bathe senor quite safe maria slope be very gradual need have fear of getting out of depth suddenly will be off at once bertie chapter xvii at work harry brother went to edge of pool where undressed waded out found that bottom of passage sloped more gradually at edge of water than did higher up be able to walk out till came to point where roof dipped into water dived in few stroke came up beyond roof be glorious bertie said have often bathed in pool be different thing altogether be more than year since have last dip in sea day arrived at callao although there be little wind roller be breaking on line of rock outside pouring over lower point in volume of foam coming in broken wave up passage must go beyond point bertie may be dashed against foot of cliff will climb up rock to left be not too steep think can manage from there will get good view of side of house of situation in general required considerable care to climb rock more than once hurt foot on sharp projection top of rock however be smooth by action of time sea be able to sit down on in comfort castle be just a described bertie certainly one sailing past however close came outside rock must be able to detect doubt stone of be built be same a of cliff most likely be taken from ravine where passage now be have fallen from arch above might have be more noticeable at first now be weathered into exactly same tint a cliff opening be very dodgily placed stranger must not dream that went many inch in now from where stand can look up into curious opening on top story have be puzzling over ever since saw ca think of possible reason for having be cut like except to enable to throw stone on to boat came into passage behind rock yet can hardly have be case for a remarked there be stone piled up there certainly have very large number of arrow stone must be very much more useful than arrow against boat almost under foot however that doe not concern now line of rock must greatly aid in hiding house from sea be higher than thought be looking down at from above be quite thirty foot above water at two three point be at least ten twelve foot higher of course short way out one must be able to see that be detached from cliff that there be passage behind besides break force of wave if be not for must be impossible for boat to come up close to face of house heavy storm might even break down wall altogether tremendous sea must roll in here in westerly gale if have be for rock must have be necessary to build lower part of house absolutely solid to resist sea be possible that rock be higher than now be when place be first constructed in case house might have be almost entirely hidden from sight well may a well go back again bertie know there be to be known about side swam back into tunnel dressed went out have come out maria bertie called coast be clear for water be not so deep a thought be can walk out to point where roof come down on to water without getting out of depth did not take long to cut number of switch to serve a broom couple of handle carried up into house lashed switch firmly on to handle work be rough broom when completed be large although not strong enough for heavy work must do well to sweep aside thin layer of almost impalpable dust on floor below will take wood down there harry think fire must be drawback rather than assistance must be very valuable if be working at one spot must give general light in place hundred foot long will take torch down hold sweep by turn will only want to begin with to make clear path couple of foot wide down middle of course later on will clear will be sufficient to enable to see how floor be constructed whether with big block small one how closely be fitted together so on be certainly unlikely that will find indication a to where chamber exist took very short time to clear path dust be so light that one sweep of broom cleared away when got to farther end returned to examine floor for four five foot from cistern rock have be evidently untouched except to cut off projecting point then there be clear line running across path bertie held torch down close to harry knelt down examined be clean cut bertie be evidently solid above stone be not quite same colour on side of look a if have cut away rock here begun to build so a to keep floor level cut may be six inch deep may be foot doe matter face of stone be very smooth be not cut be think face of natural fracture move torch along let see where next join be ah here be slab be four foot across have better sweep dust off way bertie so that may see what size be be found about eight foot long have straight edge harry almost a straight a if have be sawn very likely be sawn bertie must have have tool must cut hard stone like regularly a be certainly clever builder must have employed mean to do possibly used saw without teeth for however much might have hardened copper teeth must not have stood if have hard copper band fixed like saw mason use kept stone moistened with fine sand might have cut into of course must have be slow process must not have needed to go far into stone for when got down two three inch might have broken through by dropping heavy weight on end must not have mattered if fracture have not be straight below cut for only on surface must have wanted to fit accurately to next stone in way might have got straight edge be by driving very dry wedge into cut made by saw then moistening know that great stone can be split in way may have used method however doe matter to much how did be clear that must in way other cut stone a took trouble to do so here may conclude that be anxious to have smooth floor must be extremely difficult to get up must never have taken trouble if have merely be making floor for cellar for purpose must only have be necessary to throw rock stone of size into vacant space below when be nearly full to level with small stone sand that chose to undertake such tremendous labour a making of so regular floor a must have be show that have very strong motive for doing so going carefully along track have cleared found that stone be of different size be two foot wide others a much a ten fitted so closely together that be difficult to see joint be going to be hard job to get out bertie harry said when have completed examination be lucky for that room gradually narrow from sixteen foot wide to two at other end when stepped made eighty foot long need not take up stone near rock wall for ravine must naturally narrow a went lower depth must be greatest by side of wall of tunnel well will soon blow up stone when have got powder hope so bertie see that will have difficulty unless top stone be extraordinarily thick bertie looked surprised why must have thought thicker be more difficult to break up beyond certain point must be so suppose be six inch thick may take for granted that underneath there will be rubble loose stuff except where chamber may be built if be to bore hole through top layer powder instead of splitting stone up must expend force among loose stuff beneath besides instead of remaining in place might get scattered must then get explosion at then must only have to make hole four inch deep harry a result of there must only be two inch of tamping over powder must blow right out a if from little mortar must have effect upon stone have doubt that will find way to get over difficulty be evident that work will not be clear sailing of course will manage somehow harry even if have to smash up stone with sledge hammer dia will bring be breakfast nearly ready senora swim in sea have given prodigious appetite did enjoy nodded be very nice senor must have liked better if water have not be so blue seems so strange bathing in blue water will soon get accustomed to bertie laughed there be pool except one two mile up valley besides be much nicer to have great bathing chamber to here come jose well jose be mule right shouted yes have difficulty in catching have evidently be frightened by something be three mile up valley with coat staring must have be puma jaguar of course must have got wind of in time a fortunately be not tethered be able to get away from must think must be up somewhere among bush jose harry said have better go down tonight see if return again will be losing of mule if put stop to marauding besides will be very dangerous for jose cutting wood up there if be lurking somewhere be fortunate that escaped yesterday expect be on other side of ravine senor even if have not be sound of chopping must have scared will not often attack in daytime when have finished breakfast jose asked what must do next there be nothing else to do so must be a well to take pickax get of bracket out of wall will begin with other room of floor leave here till last will come hold torch for senor maria said like to be doing something will wash up first then will have nothing to do till be time to get ready for dinner now know there be savage beast about must not like to go down ladder there be very little chance of coming down rock harry said be more likely to be lying somewhere on other side watching mule move be made until woman be ready to start then lit two torch took one bertie other while jose harry took two pick be hard work for bracket be driven far into pillar wall be necessary to knock away stone round to depth of two three inch before must be got out worked one at side of bracket relieving other by turn after four hour work only eighteen bracket have be got out a far a must tell by lifting weight be somewhat greater than have at first supposed harry must hold one out in hand for minute half bertie jose for little over minute agreed that must be about twenty pound by time shoulder ached be agreed that have done good day work for rest of day did nothing sit on sill of window smoke quietly next day work be similar twenty more bracket be got out late in afternoon saw dia coming down step at once went down ladder to meet have got everything dia think so senor can tell that mule have have pretty heavy load to bring back well will go with at once dia bring of thing up expect have have nothing to eat since morning before do anything else have better go in wife have be keeping dish hot for a did not know when might arrive will not be long before come help senor have unsaddled mule turned out to graze be just a well dia for there be beast somewhere about gave fright last night will get eatable up to night powder drill hammer can very well leave till to morrow morning took four trip to bring provision over for required two of to carry sack of flour indeed have to give aid in getting up rocky slope at foot of wall one seemed to think unusual taking so large load hope dia harry said a sat down to evening meal senor man bought powder of be little surprised at amount wanted said that might be absent many week in mountain might want to drive level in lode might discover led to believe have seen spot in mountain gave good indication two of comrade be waiting there for return to begin work at sold llama to man who carry good from ancon up to canta got same price that gave for harry then told work on have be engaged since have be away of course there be hurry about bracket a must hing else without powder drill be just a well to get out a otherwise might have be delayed when have done other work think that weigh twenty pound so that altogether will be worth nearly four thousand pound not bad start be afraid sha' make such quick work down below will see dia said cheerfully for now that fear of demon have passed be a eager a harry to begin search for treasure have maria seen more bat yes have seen more bat wife said demon dia what do think don harry suggested that might eat bat have heard of being eaten dia said man who ate raw told that have never enjoyed anything more must not like to try unless be driven to a be how be dia be muleteer senor be up in mountain have cargo of silver on mule during day have seen men who doubted not be brigand on top of ravine passed through knew of cavern where have once taken refuge with animal during storm lay on hillside twenty thirty yard away from road entrance be hidden by bush have first noticed by seeing bear come out a be passing along have pistol thought that be better to risk meeting bear than brigand arrived opposite cave just a became dark at once led mule up there first lighted torch muleteer always carry with then went in with pistol ready there be sign of bear anywhere near entrance drove mule in put out torch entrance have be only wide enough for laden animal to pas widened out great deal inside took off load piled up in narrow part to make barricade then sat down at entrance listened soon heard five six men come down road talking be walking fast one be saying that must not be more than mile ahead that must soon catch when have gone went distance in cave relighted torch went on on cave be very large one when have gone a thought four five hundred yard branched off into three took middle one followed for long way at last opened into large chamber from there be several passage here found large number of thing have evidently be stolen from muleteer there be at least dozen mule load of silver good of kind have be brought up from coast ash of fire great many bone skin of llama sack of flour thought must now return to mule apparently entered wrong passage for went on till felt sure ought to be in chamber where have left animal be turning to go back when tripped over stone fell torch went out then felt in pocket for box of match to horror found that have gone must have dropped out when be examining passage did not think much of at first have passed several opening on way in dark probably turned down one of at rate lost way somehow wandered about think for hour might have be much le for told that quite lost head at last came out into place where must only feel rock on one side of knew that must be in large chamber looking up saw to joy faint light moving little caught sight of star be utterly worn out threw down be awakened by strange rustling sound looking up saw that daylight be breaking that stream of bat be pouring in through hole be about three foot wide made several effort to climb up to failed bat hung thickly from projecting point in rock hurt badly in one of attempt to get up twisted foot day lay there then idea struck that must kill bat cut open use a poultice to foot creature did not move when touched cut off head of one of split open did three four time during day felt that application be easing pain of ankle when became dusk bat flew out again knew only chance be to keep ankle perfectly rested in morning killed more bat be by time tortured with thirst sucked blood of one of in afternoon ate one raw night passed in morning felt so much better that must make trial ate bat to give strength in middle of day made fresh attempt have while lying there carefully examined wall of rock at top of be opening have made up mind at what point must be best to try time succeeded made way down hillside found that be quarter of mile higher up pas than spot at have left mule hobbled down to delight found animal still in cavern have when first got there opened sack of grain in order to ensure keeping quiet there be still remaining at bottom lost time in loading leading out made way down pas without seeing anything of robber afterwards went back there with good supply of torch found way to cave brought down two mule load of silver gradually brought rest of good down today be rich man well think under circumstance dia must have eaten bat be certainly clever idea of to convert into poultice though general opinion be that cold bandage be best for sprained ankle then discussed plan for next day know nothing about blasting senor give instruction will do best to carry out be useless for to talk of what know nothing about there be lot of common sense in yet in work dia sometimes while skilled man be puzzling how to do thing looker on will suggest satisfactory plan that treasure have be buried there have doubt whatever must never have gone to labour of paving cellar a carefully a have done unless for special purpose floor be undoubtedly made when house be built if find treasure chamber there will be of old people of course may have be discovered by inca when in turn wanted to bury treasure place might occur to a being particularly well fitted to escape search by spaniard however to morrow will learn something more about first thing to do in morning when have brought up rest of good be to sweep floor of chamber carefully when have done that will determine where to set to work two trip brought up powder instrument will take one of keg of powder down with said harry leave other five in empty room behind be just a well not to have in room spark fly about thing might catch fire think there be real danger at same time be best to be on safe side there be dozen pound of candle in bundle senor did not tell to get thought might be useful thank dia certainly will be useful what be tallow yes senor then before go down will get couple of piece of flat wood drive peg into sharpened at upper end candle stuck on will stand upright can put down close to where be working will give better light than torch leave free to use tool did think of buying more tinder yes senor have five box dozen more flint carried keg of powder sledge drill wedge downstairs then dia jose set to work to sweep out two chamber work be easy be obliged to stop several time being almost choked with light dust harry bertie offered to take turn others must not hear of be glad to go up to what called drawing room until work be done dust have settled little then examined pavement carefully with torch have hoped that might find copper ring at least hole where ring have be fastened there be sign of such thing in of chamber will begin to work way down harry said of course treasure may lie near cistern end depth below floor must be very willow there more likely chamber must be at deep end if begin in middle may be pretty sure that have not passed will begin rather nearer passage wall than other a depth there will be greater doe not matter stone take one be a likely a step ten pace from cistern bertie stone stop on will try first when bertie came to stand still carefully examined pavement be standing on one of crack bertie will stay there while bring tool along will open powder bertie asked be good doing that until have quite decided what be going to do wedge certainly wo go into crack think best plan will be to sink bore hole about two inch from crack will drive in in slanting direction towards edge in way will have more chance of blowing piece out first of must make slight indentation with pick otherwise sha' get bore to work will begin took pick struck several blow be very hard stone said have scarcely made mark upon worked for time then let bertie take pick lad struck blow with strength then dropped pick with loud cry wringing hand a did so have jarred hand bertie must not hold haft so tightly did sting bertie said feel a if have taken hold of red hot poker have jarred arm up to shoulder ca go on at present try dia dia went more carefully to work knelt down on one knee proceeded to give number of what seemed light blow be better than did dia stone be crumbling into dust will be able to use borer in short time perhaps will be better after to drive hole down straight will be easier to begin with when see how thick stone be will know better how to proceed in ten minute dia have made hole quarter of inch deep now give one of borer one about two half foot long will hold strike to begin with dia only mind finger keep eye fixed on top of borer take one two gentle stroke to begin with then when know distance have to stand from do best need really be afraid of striking finger will hold drill at least foot from top dia began very carefully gradually adding to strength of blow a got right distance be soon striking hard after blow harry turned borer slight distance round when heard native breath coming fast told jose to take turn lad be nervous first blow struck only grazed top of borer narrowly missed harry finger jose dropped sledge ca do senor be afraid of hitting finger will sit down hold doe not matter if hit must matter good deal jose have got to learn must not be well senor dia said to take borer three hammer outside try in soft ground must work there till got accustomed always to hit fair there must be occasion for to be held must get confident must have hit twice a hard a did if have be afraid of missing think be very good plan dia loss of day two will make difference will make up for afterwards accordingly drill hammer be taken up be soon at work two three gentle tap be given to borer to make stand upright then four began work at first often missed head of borer struck unevenly be well dia that carried out suggestion a see must have have uncommonly good chance of getting finger smashed wrist broken have missed a often a of stopped frequently for breath at end of hour be glad to lay down hammer dia be comparatively fresh practice a woodsman now did good service must have thought from number of tree have helped to cut down bertie said that must hit pretty hard be great deal stiffer work must say that hammer be at least twice weight of axe be lightest of four ache good deal worse than did when first chopped that tree down so do bertie will stick at till get accustomed to work by doing so will gain strength a well a skill will get grease senor from maria then will rub shoulder arm will do great deal of good thank dia must be good plan dia did to jose a well a to brother then jose in turn rubbed waited hour then harry said let have spell time quarter of hour sufficed be of use harry ca go on longer bertie said feel a if shoulder be broken be beginning to feel same bertie however be hitting straighter now will go up into shade take quietly for two three hour then will have spell again however after rest agreed that must be useless to try again for must not lift arm over head without feeling acute pain three day be spent at exercise at end of time have gained confidence head of drill be no longer missed after first day only worked for quarter of hour at time taking hour rest pain in arm have begun to abate on following day practised striking alternately three standing round one borer found at first awkward by end of day be able to strike in regular order blow falling faster after other on to drill think will do now said bertie doubt will hit harder with fortnight practice will be able to keep up longer however think that even now have sufficient confidence in striking to be able to hold borer without fear of accident next day began work early in cellar jose volunteered to take first turn to hold drill understand jose must turn round little after stroke in way will cut hole regularly harry took place on one side of jose who sat with leg on side of drill dia stood facing harry bertie behind jose holding torch so that light fell strongly on head of drill at first two men struck gently gradually a grew confident increased weight of stroke until be hitting with full power after ten minute stopped let look at hole harry said how far have got down jose moved position harry examined hole about eighth of inch said let scrape dust out of will take spell now harry bertie said will wait five minute then go on again after will change place with relieving other twenty minute work went on at end of two hour hole be three inch deep hour half drill suddenly went down be through bertie said be not sorry now will lift drill up gently bertie do kneel down when stop take hold of close to floor so that may see thickness of stone five inch said a measured now put on little grease dia will lower again will be perhaps able then to get idea of what be underneath lowered drill turned round two three time then carefully raised sand little stone be sticking to sand gravel said that settle that point now have done good morning work let go up have breakfast maria looked enquiringly at be just coming down for well what have done have drilled one hole maria none of have got finger smashed so think have reason to be satisfied with first experience at work a breakfasted talked matter over harry said that be certain that thickness of stone be not sufficient for to break up by blasting will have to try other plan be equally certain that can not smash stone with sledge hammer think that wedge must break of course if got one stone out must be comparatively easy to lift next a must put crowbar under if can do in other way must drill line of hole close to other right across stone might then break off piece between crack get crowbar under slab might be worth while to drill hole foot apart from point where have begun to other end of room of course if found that gravel stone be everywhere under slab must learn nothing opening to chamber be probably covered by stone if found that must put in one two more hole so a to be sure that be flat in case might smash somehow of course if come upon flat stone will conclude that put layer of sand fine gravel over slab covering vault must then a say get up one stone gradually lift rest clearing out gravel a go to depth of foot so in way will make sure that will not miss chamber there may be think must certainly be best plan at present be groping altogether in dark will take fortnight at least to make row of hole close to other a propose chapter xviii disappointment six more day be spent in driving hole according to harry plan result be in case same sand small stone be brought up attached to grease have now sunk hole at much more rapid rate than at first for be accustomed to work muscle have hardened be able to strike more frequently with greater force must have got on still more quickly have not be for trouble in sharpening drill be heated in small blacksmith fire dia have brought be first placed in fire be not sufficiently hot to raise beyond dull red glow when be done shovelful of glowing fragment be taken from fire placed on hearth among small bellow raised end of drill to white heat when of course be easily worked at first have difficulty in tempering sometimes when cooled point be too soft at other time too brittle at end of week have arrived at proper medium one of party have to work steadily to keep drill in good order bertie be daily employed at work a jose generally failed to give proper temper to tool bertie however generally managed to get in two three hour work below although perfectly ready to do share be by mean sorry to be otherwise employed for part of day a be now able to talk spanish with perfect fluency donna maria maintained lively conversation whenever be together party however be glad when sunday came round gave day of complete rest then must bathe fish shoot pigeon lie in shade according to fancy recommence work with fresh vigour next morning just fortnight after have begun work be about to begin hole in fresh stone talking over have come to conclusion that be most likely spot in cellar for situation of underground chamber farther on there must scarce be width for one for be here eight foot across where have already tried there must scarcely have be depth enough seemed to to be happy medium before setting to work dia passed torch over stone presently stopped will light two of candle senor torch flicker too much to see very plainly somewhat surprised for such close examination have be made before candle be lighted handed to dia knelt down with face close to stone moved about carefully examining for minute without speaking stone senor be broken said at last broken into dozen piece have be so carefully fitted together again that dust settled upon quite prevented seeing till swept again just now be only because there be tiny chip out where first looked that noticed harry knelt down also examined stone like others have not be faced with tool consequently although roughly even there be slight irregularity in surface now a dia pointed out to saw that there be line running through here there look here senor stone have be struck here here be dent be scarcely noticeable surface have taken same colour a rest of stone be of irregular size from quarter of inch to inch in diameter nearly in centre of stone from point several of crack started certainly look a if stone have be struck with something heavy harry said must think by appearance very heavy piece of rock must have be dropped upon yes senor very heavy rock so heavy that there must have be many men to lift must have be heavy indeed to break up slab perhaps be not so thick a others dia suggested like dia well let set to work will try wedge there be use against solid stone might move piece put one of borer just at place from crack start at least suppose be crack let drive in for inch hold jose turn want to go in just in line with crack know can not drive in far at least may make go deep enough to give wedge hold in five such small hole be made in crack seemed to form rough circle then wedge be put in began to work with sledge in ten minute harry examining place carefully said bit of stone be breaking up there be line running across from wedge give heaviest sledge swung round head brought down dozen time in centre of wedge crack opened so far that must see without stooping now will try with crowbar said in ten minute fragment of stone be got up then hammered on wedge again piece of rock be roughly seven eight inch in diameter broke completely off be only about two half inch thick harry said a drew one of fragment out holding candle to hole went on there be slab underneath settle be at top of one of vault question be be empty be afraid be stone have evidently be broken up fitted in again with wonderful care why must be fitted in carefully if emptied chamber ca tell dia be of use trying to guess now first of will get rest of stone up wo be difficult for now that have made start can use crowbar jose run up tell brother to come down will want to help with crowbar besides must of course wish to be here now that be on point of making discovery one way other in minute bertie came down with jose donna maria followed jose tell have broken hole in one of stone bertie exclaimed a ran up have got bit out of broken stone bertie stone have be broken before evidently not by accident be only thickness of others a can see there be slab underneath who can have broken harry that question can not decide must say probably inca agreed that be very possible discovered hidden treasure of chimoos must have learned a spaniard did how cleverly place be hidden must have be a evident to a be to that if there be hiding place here must be spot when one two more piece of stone have be got out by aid of crowbar rest be removed without least difficulty slab two foot square be exposed in middle of be copper ring slab fitted into stone casing about eighteen inch wide a soon a casing be cleared dia jose took place on one side two brother on other crowbar be thrust through ring of taking hold of end lifted with strength at first stone did not move at second effort lifted suddenly be same thickness a one have broken on being moved be easily handled torch be thrust down peered eagerly into vault so far a must see be empty will jump down senor ' air may be bad jose run up bring down short length of rope twenty foot will be ample now let torch drop down dia if burn will be safe for to go down if not must keep on dropping blazing brand into till burn a however torch burnt brightly harry lay down saying hold leg bertie looked down into vault eighteen inch below surface hole widened out suddenly minute later harry head appeared above surface again be empty said in a cheerful voice a must manage of course be disappointment went on felt certain that must be so directly found stone be cracked only hope be that first finder of treasure afterwards used place for same purpose that thought possible might do so be clear by care with fitted stone together none of others spoke disappointment be heavy one bertie broke silence by saying well better luck next time may have found out place there may be others did not find quite so bertie now have got up one stone will be comparatively easy work getting up others will take up stone to end then work back till get to place where there be not more than couple of foot between bottom of stone top of rock at moment jose ran into room with rope harry took dropped one end until nearly touched floor below hold on said will slip down first minute later stood at bottom of chamber beside torch be still burning be only about three foot across at bottom said wall by passage go straight up on other side be bare rock so be almost wedge shaped be twenty foot long five foot high up to roof that make nearly seven to upper part of mouth vault be absolutely empty moved about for minute then said gold have be stored here there be particle of gold at bottom there be gold dust in crack of broken face of rock now will come up again hold rope tight will climb about yard then can get finger on ledge be soon up now do of want to go down dia jose shook head bertie grumbled want to look at beastly hole have be trouble enough to get at well think will not do more to day dia have rather taken heart out of one still must not expect to hit upon treasure for first time will go up talk over when have smoked pipe two will be more inclined to take cheerful view of matter wo talk about till have got to end of second pipe tobacco did usual work be with cheerful voice bertie broke silence inca must have be pretty sharp fellow to find hole harry well very likely heard that chimoos have treasure there indeed must have known because see not one of other stone be broken so evidently knew where chamber be situated yes suppose that be well be in fine working order now sha' be very long getting other stone up not very long side anyhow bertie will want short block of wood to put under stone a raise expect be five inch thick must be very big weight evidently be going to be longish job a have be fortnight without fresh meat dia have better go off buy dozen sheep wo have dead meat time can bring slung over mule can kill a want have not have fresh meat have not done badly harry have generally have good many egg pigeon jose have brought in fish from pool have dwindled down lately only brought in couple of fish yesterday evening well pigeon be getting scarcer too bertie have killed good many rest be getting very shy think most of must have gone off settled in new place on face of rock above ravine while dia be away will try lay in stock of sea fish can swim out sit on rock during day lay line at night have worked very hard for fortnight deserve holiday dia when be spoken to said must start at once with four mule for huacha be not above fifteen mile said can get there evening must think must buy sheep there if not must go on to huaura mule will bring two sheep of course must drive must seem more singular have certainly better take mule dia tie sheep carefully on so that will not be hurt will take eight of leather bag senor sheep be not large will sling one on side of mule yes must be a well while be about to bring eight may a well get more coffee drink lot of like strong if wife think will want more sugar anything else by mean get a soon a dia started line be got ready cut couple of sapling to serve a rod jose digging among rock found plenty of worm beetle grub for bait in addition took cake two of maize to break up throw in to attract fish have better swim out in flannel shirt trouser harry said will soon dry will keep off sun if be to sit there without must get blistered from head to foot will fish outside rock inside harry will try think be likelier to catch most inside must think back water like must attract met with equal success on side of rock by evening have caught over forty fish at least half of weighed over four pound then set long line carrying forty hook returned to castle with a many fish a must possibly carry maria be delighted with addition to larder jose set to work at once to clean split in morning be hung in string from broad window maria said must get benefit of heat from wall air there might be must be able to pas round by mean of night line caught almost a many fish a have done with rod day have satisfaction of bringing in more than must carry in one journey have got plenty now to keep going for three week harry said can always replenish stock when choose dia returned at sunset carrying one sheep over shoulder have left others out there senor think there be fear of straying there be fresh grass anywhere except near stream moreover being strange to valley will naturally keep near mule month passed in continuous labour stone have be taken up in basement have first visited other chamber have be found parallel chamber have given much trouble at starting a stone have be found showing crack upon have have to blast one stone to piece before must begin to cut up others chamber have be discovered until be within six foot of farther end then one be found showed sign of having ever be used so far so bad harry said when supper have be eaten almost in silence be reason why must be disheartened if inca buried treasure may have thought prudent to choose other spot than used by old people where must be harry agreed that there be not sufficient depth between floor for place of concealment be so bertie of course have be thinking of lot during past few day when chance of finding treasure under basement be nearly extinguished there be still side wall side wall bertie repeated surely be built against rock yes know how straight wall of rock be see did not build against at in basement above that side wall begin rock must have be irregular a wall be built space behind may have be filled in may not when came to build may have found that there be cavern cavern in rock nothing be more likely may have left sort of entrance to cavern a place of refuge to garrison if place be taken a hiding place might have thought more secure for purpose than underground chamber be general hiding place at rate be possible to morrow vote that have thorough inspection of wall of storeroom below must be most likely place for near sea level chance of finding cavern must be much greater than higher up bertie face brightened a harry proceeded certainly seems possible harry of course other place seemed so much more likely to that have never given side wall thought may find something there after do hope may old boy can not believe that after thing have gone altogether so well with have be twice so near finding treasure that must fail after side will begin on will have look at before decide bertie have not really examined since first day really forget what store found in two side room examination in morning showed that passage near entrance to rock on left hand side have be used for fuel on other side be filled at upper end with skin for distance spear sheaf of arrow be piled against outer wall along rest of distance do think be most likely hiding place must say right hand passage other with fire wood in might be visited day spear arrow must only be wanted in case of attack upon castle to arm large force going out to give battle there must naturally put anything wanted to hide in passage le likely to be visited that doe seem probable bertie agreed therefore hurrah for right hand side still think senor dia said that there must be treasure concealed somewhere must not think guard must have be placed here remained here so many year still keeping watch a find did at big loophole on top floor unless there be something to watch quite so dia have thought that over in way can see possible motive for being here except to prevent place from being examined that be needle if there be nothing to guard nothing to take away except silver bracket in day must scarcely have be worth trouble of getting out carrying away there must be treasure somewhere know now that be not in basement will try side wall even if have to blow half of in there be doubt that stone be at least a thick a at end will not be difficult to manage noticed in upper story that have not taken trouble to fit nearly so accurately a did of outer wall say that did fit well stone be of irregular size have doubt that in many place must prize out with crowbar once opening be made there will be difficulty in getting lot of out a old people did not use cement mortar well to morrow morning will move spear arrow across to other side of passage have good look at stone will go up first look at side wall of other room see if be of same build there may be difference have not noticed see side wall of room be built like in front did notice whether be same in other room will look at once dia said lighting torch at fire senor said when in ten minute returned none of wall on floor be built of stone like be grand chamber stone be nearly one size so well fitted that can hardly see where join other in other room be not so stone be a noticed above irregular in size although fit closely there be attempt to conceal crack thank dia well wo look more to night will see in morning if room below be built in same way have doubt be at rate have done enough for to day there be whisky left in bottle bertie may a well make glass of grog maria have better get down jar of pulque will drink to better luck next time woman smiled faintly did not often do so now spirit have gradually gone down a hope of success faded now maria harry said have better take glass of pulque for know often touch have be working so of late that think want more than of can not help feeling low spirited senor said have so hoped that must find treasure wanted marry lady love must be such joy for to have in small way repaid service rendered that felt quite broken down know ought not to have be when brother bear disappointment so bravely 'it be of use cry over spilt milk be english saying maria besides be possible that milk may not be spilt yet until lately good spirit have helped greatly to keep up if be once convinced that have failed have doubt must feel hard hit be long way from giving up hope yet there be treasure here if have to blow up whole of old place will find have got six month yet in six month one can do wonder anyhow bracket will pay very well for work certainly must not have earned sum in other way in same time even if fail in great object will have satisfaction of knowing have done in power to gain will know have done best have always told when have written how much owe to dia how faithfully have served how have always be so bright pleasant have doubt have cheered up a well a maria be wiping eye now be too good senor be so little can do dia to show gratitude nonsense show in way even in matter of fact way of always giving excellent food be by mean unimportant now will turn in make fresh start to morrow morning be up at daybreak after taking usual cup of coffee lit torch descended stair to floor below a soon a reached right hand wall harry exclaimed why be built in same way a one have left stone be squared fitted together a closely a in drawing room then why must that be except in one room side wall way up be roughly built why must have taken trouble on floor to build be only meant a store room when even in room above be meant for habitation of chief family rough work be deemed sufficiently good there must have be motive for dia there must have be senor be certainly strange first of let clear wall take general view of guessing wo help have strongest hope behind one of stone lie cavern by way dia take torch go into next chamber see if stone be solid there be just same a here dia said when returned must rather that have be other way harry said for then must have be more sure that there be special reason for building in way here took all hour work to move spear arrow to other side do think harry if be to tap stone must be able to find whether there be hollow behind of harry shook head not in least have doubt stone be two three foot thick there must be difference in sound must make if struck whether be filled in solid behind have backing to begin with will make careful examination of wall possibly will see sign of stone having be moved must be very much more difficult to take one of great block out put in again than must be to get up one of paving stone when have gone about way along examining stone with greatest care bertie who be ahead of rest passing candle held along edge of joint said look here stone project nearly inch beyond rest others gathered round stone be of unusual size being fully two half foot wide four foot long bottom joint being two foot above floor bertie moved along to let others look at edge be keeping finger on joint have scarcely come up when said other end of stone sunk in about a much a end project something certainly occurred to shift stone little harry said examining carefully be curious if others have be displaced one must have put down to shock of earthquake common enough occurrence here above below stone be level with others nowhere about house have seen such displacement look there be heap of rubbish along foot of wall here stir up dia let see what be be sand small stone chip look like chip of rock yes bit look a say a if have be chipped off rock not like water worn stone though how got here where everywhere else thing be perfectly tidy can not say however can think that over afterwards now for stone let put weight against projecting end in least expect that can move at rate can try pushed together think moved little harry said looked at edge yes be not above half a far out now a be be curious for if be a thick a took to be must weigh at least couple of ton wo try to push in farther be sorry pushed at now give that heavy sledge jose possibly there may be hollow sound to will hit at other end for want to go in farther went to stone beyond first struck two three blow with strength then did same with stone that be examining think give such dead sound said others be of same opinion good be piece of luck said have certainly hit on something out of way hammering have brought end out again harry bertie said so have have pushed end in little let try again although took turn with sledge must make further impression on stone well will try drill harry said in first place will find out how thick be at once set to work with drill progress be slower than have be before because instead of striking down on head of drill have now to swing hammer sideways lost advantage of weight be obliged to work very carefully a miss must have seriously damaged one holding drill took four hour steady work to get hole in three inch ten minute later to astonishment drill suddenly disappeared dia who be striking nearly fell for instead of resistance have expected drill shot forward hammer hit jose who have time be holding drill heavy blow on arm causing to utter shout of pain harry who be sitting down having breakfast having just handed hammer to bertie jumped to foot how did manage dia suppose slipped off head must have hit jose very heavy blow have hit heavy blow senor nearly tumbled down struck drill fairly enough have gone gone where dia think must have gone right through hole senor then there be empty space behind harry shouted joyfully however went on in changed tone must see to jose first that blow may have fractured arm let look jose think anything be broken there be nasty cut on wrist be fortunate that be not striking straight down dia for be sure have not put anything approaching strength into blow now be hitting sideways that exerted before have better go up to maria jose get to bathe wrist with cold water put on bandage now senor what will do next well now that know that weight can not be anything very great certainly to extent can be moved will try hammering again at end do stand three four foot beyond so a to be able to bring sledge down with strength just on lower corner will face strike six eight inch above where hit of course must bring hammer down at same instant will be able to do after two three trial stand at other end of stone bertie tell if move at after one two attempt two men got to swing hammer so a to strike precisely at same moment when dozen blow have fallen bertie said come out little at blow be not much come three four minute later reported be inch half out now there be room to get end of crowbar in here be curious harry said a lowered sledgehammer taking up candle examined end where have be striking be sunk about same distance bertie stone must work somehow on pivot now put crowbar into end bertie have be watching three threw weight on lever slowly stone yielded to pressure moved farther out be pushed open until crowbar must act no longer a lever must now get hold of inside edge be only very slowly with repeated effort that must turn stone round at last stood fairly at right angle to wall dividing opening into equal part about two foot four there be pivot under be quite evident may be copper ball in stone below may be that knob of upper stone project into hole in lower however doe not matter how work here be opening into something dia will go upstairs tell wife jose to come down have better bring dozen more torch stock here be getting low will want a much light a possible be only fair that must share in discovery dia went off now bertie must not let hope grow too high think be more likely than not that will find nothing here why do think so harry made sure have a good a got treasure think if there have be treasure harry went on that stone must have be closed with greatest care must hardly have left so carelessly closed that anyone who examined wall must have noticed just a did found other place most carefully closed though there be nothing in perhaps there be something prevented from shutting little stone something know that be so bertie because stone yielded to weight if did so now must have be shut with greatest ease originally when doubt pivot be kept oiled whole worked perfectly smoothly be almost certain that be able in way to fasten securely when be shut what be piece of square stone lying there fell down from above just a slab opened harry took up be about six inch long by two inch square be very hard stone said granite must say expect will find that fit into hole in stone above yes there be hole here bertie said feeling stone go right in well think bertie will find hole in end of stone moved that will fit bertie crept in felt along top of stone yes there be hole here about same size a stone be not more than three inch deep then that stone be bolt bertie see be pushed up door then closed when stone be exactly in place must drop into hole keep from moving nothing short of breaking up bolt must give entrance be lucky that did not push quite to quarter of inch that bolt must have fallen must not have moved unless by smashing whole thing into bit be why did not quite close stone wanted to get in again here come others maria have be washing clothes in stream have therefore be longer in coming than if have be in room looked greatly excited so have found senor dia exclaimed in delight have found entrance into somewhere be afraid will be a empty a other chamber why do think so senor dia asked in dismay harry repeated reason have given bertie for belief that stone must have be left in position a to be easily opened when required why must have be left so because treasure expected have never arrived be possible that when inca discovered treasure in chamber searched may also have found entrance may have be shown to by one of prisoner may have broken stone here into piece a broke that over chamber afterwards seeing what splendid hiding place be may have when spaniard first arrived made stone to fit with intention of using for hiding place fact that stone be left so that must be at once opened be conclusive proof to mind that treasure never came that heap of sand small stone chip of rock be proof that be ready to receive treasure be probably swept out of chamber be behind here must of course have be removed when treasure be put in door closed a treasure never did come be left where lay however will now go see have only kept waiting because did not want to be disappointed one by one crept through opening for four foot in passage be same width a stone two foot deeper then at once opened into large cavern wall be four foot thick see dia apparently squared stone be only used for facing a stone be of irregular shape on back must be natural cavern splendid hiding place make doubt existence be one of reason for building castle cavern be twelve foot wide thirty foot high at mouth floor sloped up sharply side contracted met forty foot from mouth floor have be cut into step two foot wide running across cave extending to back step be faced with perfectly flat slab of stone cave be empty native uttered loud exclamation of disappointment regret harry have so thoroughly made up mind that nothing must be found there that surveyed place calmly in silence bertie imitated example with difficulty for too be bitterly disappointed see dia harry went on quietly place be prepared to receive treasure step have be swept perfectly clean see gold must be piled up doubt step be cut faced with stone to prevent gold dust might fall from bag in doubt must be brought small nugget from falling into crack crevice of rock must say that in probability expected that treasure ship be lost have everything in readiness for hiding cargo here directly came never did come door be shut a far a must be without bolt falling down fastening then waited for ship if did not arrive other treasure might be brought by land well can not be helped so far have failed there may still be treasure hidden somewhere can not say that have searched place thoroughly yet for six week worked hard wall be broken through in several place sign of existence of other cavern hiding place be discovered must give up harry said when at end of time be sitting gloomily round fire for one thing can see possible explanation why party of men must have be left here guard kept for perhaps hundred year perhaps more story about demon be circulated people who ventured to approach be murdered unless there have be good reason for reason must only have be a far a can see that there be treasure hidden here have turned over over in mind thousand time can think of other reason can bertie dia bertie replied have often thought about a say there must have be good reason for people in sens must have spent life in old place starved here unless have cause for dia made reply beyond shaking head see harry went on kept up watch to end there be two skeleton of men who have died at post at curious window where nothing must be seen hate to give up search yet seem to have tried point where there be possibility of hiding place existing chapter xix treasure next morning harry said will go upstairs to look out place again have be up there pretty nearly day stared down ca get out of mind that key of mystery lie there that hole be made for other purpose than merely throwing stone out on to of who might go in behind rock have puzzled worried over will come up with harry must rather did will go up by spend morning there idea may occur to may a well have quiet day of lit pipe went upstairs jose went off to mule bertie descended ladder strolled round what called courtyard looking for egg among rock in tuft of grass growing higher up dia scattered few handful of maize to chicken then assisted maria to catch two of after descended ladder sat down gloomily upon stone have become more more depressed in spirit a search became daily more hopeless although worked a hard a anyone seldom spoke while harry brother often joked showed outward sign of disappointment hour passed then harry appeared suddenly at window bertie dia come up at once have idea ran to ladder climbed up excitement with spoke showed that idea be important one now dia broke out a joined know that part of inca treasure be sent off by boat belief of indian be that be never heard of again be so senor there be certainly storm day after started a have told be never heard of again have be report of must surely have come down believe dia that boat be dashed to piece against line of rock outside entrance to passage have reason to believe that people here be expecting treasure to arrive have entrance to cave in readiness to receive certainly no better place must have be chosen for concealment boat may have be coming here when storm broke drove towards shore probably attempted to gain mouth of cove missed be dashed to piece against rock indian on guard here doubt saw must be sure that heavy sack box containing gold must sink to bottom must lie perfectly secure there even more secure than if have be removed placed in cave must always be recovered when spaniard left so be content to leave there still obeyed order have received to keep watch for ever over treasure to do so knocked that strange hole through wall always kept two men on guard there so must have gone on who succeeded never wavered doubtless received food from friend outside of went out a have done to fetch in then came time when for reason other doubtless a supposed before when spaniard swept pretty nearly native up to work in mine dared not issue out attempt to get food be made when too late by men whose skeleton found on step when first came here rest be too feeble to repeat experiment died two sentinel at post rest in room where found hurrah bertie shouted have doubt have hit harry believe after that be going to find be splendid will dance at wedding harry have begun to think never must do be young as bertie be only idea have have several idea before nothing have come of something be going to come of be convinced must bet money on well will go have trial at once what do think dia harry said paying attention to bertie last remark think be quite possible senor certainly if indian have be told to guard treasure must do so always know how kept secret entrusted to torture be put to if gold have be a say lost amongst rock do think must have still watched place thought strange that must have made that hole when said that might have made to throw stone down seemed to to be likely enough other suggestion be more probable well senor be ready to try be not very good swimmer brother be good swimmer will do part of work hardest part will be getting up will be able to give help at well let be off bertie said be on thorn to begin will soon find out if be there be almost certain to be at foot of rock though of course be possible that boat sank before striking at rate feel sure went down somewhere within area can be seen through hole wo take many day diving to search yard of bottom hastily descended ladder divesting of clothes swam out through opening dia climbed up on rock others swam round by end of barrier water be so warm that must be able to remain in for time without inconvenience need not begin here bertie be outside line of sight from hole must not see end of rock will start at middle work in opposite direction on arriving off centre of wall dived depth be about twelve foot a water be perfectly clear harry must see four five foot round be obliged to swim carefully for bottom be covered with rock for most part rounded by action of sea for hour continued search by time have reached nearly end of line of rock then landed on ledge of rock sat down calling to bertie to join will rest for quarter of hour said then begin again time will keep twenty thirty foot farther out be more likely to be there than close in if boat struck next wave must sweep over must probably go down stern first cargo must fall out way after rest started again swam out few stroke then dived harry have gone down five six time when on coming to surface heard shout saw bertie swimming towards have found harry there be number of ingot be so heavy must not bring one of to surface a harry reached lad turned round swam back there be just opposite that cleft in rock looked directly came up so a to know exact spot harry trod water for minute then took long breath dived be a bertie have said scattered among rock be score of ingot have lost brilliancy shone with dull copperish hue with bright gleam here there where rock have grated against putting one hand on block of rock lifted one of with other about twenty pound said to thank god hilda be a good a won then rose to surface shake hand bertie there be enough there to make rich for life now will get back again have to think matter over see how be to be got ashore there be hurry have lain there for three hundred year must lie there a much longer if did not take have found dia shouted latter gave yell of delight swim ashore will join there not word be spoken until have dressed walked out be too excited even to think harry broke out be time for dinner when have have that smoked pipe will be able to talk calmly over maria be wild with delight at news laughed cried by turn even jose who be accustomed to take thing quietly be almost a excited woman be only called to herself when harry said laughing maria for first time since started from lima be letting dinner burn to think of cried be fault senor must not have told about till sat down wo have to cook much longer maria will be able now to have servant house a big a like beautiful garden must not like senor what must do day with be glad senor glad for sake dia said gravely to will make difference said there be enough there to make rich assuredly be so not one peso of will touch man with indian blood in vein not even poorest in peru must have aught to do with ounce of inca treasure when be buried curse be laid upon who betrayed hiding place who ever touched gold have brought curse upon spain at time spaniard landed here be great nation now glory have departed no longer own land tyrannized over for three hundred year have heard that power in europe have altogether gone must be curse of gold must never have allowed great englishman cochrane with two three ship to conquer here mind be easy a to finding of treasure came here in spite of prayer that must not do so be who have made discovery not will take share in gold from day took must be cursed man flesh must melt away must suffer torture must die miserable death well dia will not try to persuade know that christian though be native belief still cling to will not argue against have money of own from will give enough to make comfortable for life that can take without feeling that have incurred curse from finding of treasure thank heartily dia said gratefully thank with heart have ever be wanderer now will gladly settle down desire wealth enough to live on in comfort with wife only to travel when plea will have enough for more dia after more meat have be cooked eaten have smoked pipe harry said boat must of course be best thing there be difficulty connected with there be spot a far a know where must land for fifteen mile on side there must only be small village where everything did must be seen talked about there be place where must keep boat here for if even slight breeze sprang up swell coming in round passage between rock cliff must smash up in time be so senor harry be silent again for time then said only plan can think of be to get strong leather bag then must take one down with when dive with strong cord tied to put couple of ingot into must haul up on to rock so on until have finished day work then must carry to side of rock there must put three four at time into bag drop down in water must swim up tunnel haul in then bring bag back again sha' be able to get anything approaching ingot for great many of must have gone in between crevice of rock unless broke up with powder must be next to impossible without diving dress air pump sort of thing can not be bought in country must not get at however have only just begun to look for yet may come across pile heavy a sea must be on coast in gale hardly think must much affect pile of ingot weight must keep steady even be big rock rolled about think best thing dia must be for to go off with two three mule will soon be running short of provision have better get enough flour dried meat to last for month suppose will be a long a be a well to have good store so a not to have to make journey again then have better get twenty leather bag such a in bring ore down from mountain have plenty of stout rope will want thin cord for tying neck of bag may a well bring keg of spirit brandy if can get bag of coffee sugar anything else think of now be millionaire can afford to be comfortable by way might a well afternoon get rest of silver bracket out be not part of inca treasure can take a share without fear of curse must be best for to smelt down know of native can do do think that be not part of inca treasure senor dia said doubtfully certainly not be undoubtedly here before inca time even have be put there by inca must not call hidden treasure might be part of inca property certainly not part of treasure hid be altogether too much senor be noble of to offer not at owe everything find to must be only fair that must have at least third of gold still if wo touch that must take silver heard say that be worth four thousand pound well if be lucky will get twenty time a much dia certainly will take senor grateful will be to maria said so will jose who will inherit day a be only relative have agree with dia about gold have heard so often about curse on must be afraid well maria see there be lot of nonsense in superstition know be one of that place be guarded by demon now have seen for that be humbug if be afraid about silver will take to england sell there send money fetch must give great deal of trouble will be difficult to get gold safely away without being bothered with silver have better buy bag of charcoal dia suppose will use that small hearth have senor must take immense time to do in will load one of mule with hard brick will want two mule to carry hundred dia think weigh about four pound half will be enough plenty senor will want bellow jose can work two of will make great heat can melt two three hundred pound day have helped to make many furnace up in mountain know very well about way to build work very well then be settled have better start to morrow morning with jose will spend day in finding out little more about gold dia started next morning two brother be in water most of day harry found a have expected that great deal of treasure have sunk out of reach between rock came upon one pile have apparently be originally packed in sack skin lying in heap little farther out than have before searched have doubt that be point where stern of boat have sunk considerable portion of content have be shot out while rest have be scattered about a boat broke up a skin rotted content have fallen between rock there be a nearly a must calculate two hundred fifty to three hundred ingot in pile need not trouble about rest laughed to ingot if weighs twenty pound be worth thousand two hundred of must make a rich a man can want to be can hardly believe in luck be stupendous fancy half pay lieutenant with two hundred thousand pound old fortescue will become one of most complaisant of father in law evening before dia left harry have written letter for to post at callao telling hilda to keep up brave heart for that hoped to be at home before end of second year with money enough to satisfy father must not tell so unless felt certain of what be saying told before left that be almost forlorn hope be undertaking that chance be ten thousand to one against think now that one chance have turned up hope to be home within two month of time that receive letter did not say more even now must scarcely believe that good fortune have befallen feared that unlucky fate might interfere between fulfilment of hope when dia returned after two day absence work began morning worked together at bringing up gold piling ingot on rock be slower work than harry have expected for on hauling bag to rock be often caught by boulder bertie sometimes have to dive four five time before must free get ashore gold be piled in tunnel just beyond water in fortnight last ingot must get at be stored with fellow two hundred eighty two in have repeatedly talked over best plan of getting gold away finally concluded that must be risking too much to take into town that best plan must be for harry to buy boat at callao a naval officer must be natural enough decided to procure three time a many bag a ingot must really require that must put in bag three ingot only filling up with piece of stone so that weight must not exceed what must have be be content heavy ore harry arranged that must go down to callao buy large boat after having made several excursion to accustom official at callao to seeing going about must make bargain with captain of two ship about to sail to england to carry about two ton of ore must put on board after dark so a to avoid extortion must have to submit to before port official others must allow to ship question puzzled most be best way of taking bag into boat dia be in favour of being carried on mule to point lower down coast at must be loaded into boat must be only necessary to carry gold said stone to fill bag must be put in there objection to be that might be observed at work at most point must be difficult to run boat up to get off again through roller if boat be brought round into inlet must be loaded there comfortably only fear be of being caught in gale a gale be by mean frequent risk be small must sudden storm come on when be lying there be broken up must be easy to recover gold from willow water behind rock be therefore settled only treasure be to be taken away at once not till have be got on board ship vessel have sailed must boat come back for rest of treasure dia be at once to start with mule carry silver in two journey to safe place among mountain there must bury in three four hiding place to be fetched out a might require only taking fifty pound to lima here be to dispose of portion of to one of dealer who made business to buy up silver from native a many of worked small mine sent down produce once month to lima there must be nothing suspicious in being offered for sale especially a must be known that dia have be away for very long time among mountain be necessary that sale must be effected at once because harry stock of money be running very low must have to pay for passage of bertie to england for freight of gold dia be to dispose later on of remaining store powder tool three riding mule two day later last of silver bracket have be melted dia harry started with eight mule six of being laden with silver struck back at once into hill after travelling for two day ascended wild gorge be not once year that anyone must come up here senor there be way out of can bury silver here with certainty that will be safe from disturbance yes will be safe here a want have only to make journey with couple of mule to fetch a much a require carry home bury in garden under house then must from time to time take few ingot into town dispose of to begin with will borrow fifty pound weight of get to dispose of for at lima money be beginning to run short will have to pay for freight of gold own passage home to buy boat large enough to carry treasure be not likely that there will be two vessel sailing at same time in case will make two trip a must not put on board until night before ship sailed of course must go home with second lot will never know what to do with tenth part of silver senor must never do for to make show of being rich authority must seize perhaps torture to make reveal source of wealth well there be thousand of countryman in deepest poverty dia must secretly help in distress single ingot ten pound in weight must be fortune to when die might get respectable lawyer to make out will leaving treasure to charity for benefit of indian giving of course instruction where treasure be to be found that be good dia said thank senor will make very happy have brought pick shovel with dividing bag buried at distance apart rolling stone to cover up hiding place obliterating sign of ground having be disturbed hundred pound be left out with in saddle bag arrived at lima two day later harry went on alone into callao have difficulty in purchasing ship boat in fair condition carried two lug sail be amply large enough for purpose for be required being nearly thirty foot long with beam of six foot got cheaply for ship to belonged have be wrecked distance along coast portion of crew have launched made way to callao mate who be sole surviving officer be glad to accept ten pound harry offered for a must enable crew to exist until must obtain passage home ship on board british vessel short of hand boat be too large to be worked by one man seeing that mate be honest intelligent fellow harry arranged with to aid to sail boat day went out for hour after spending week in apparent idleness getting to know more of man harry told that have really bought boat for purpose of getting ore have discovered on board

others be hanging on till can get berth hope few will be able to go in two ship name have applied at present of crew may desert before time for sailing come of course must get better paid if went a part of crew than if merely worked passage home be sorry for harry said here be five pound to help to hold on a old naval officer can feel for men in place dia after selling silver have week before returned with mule to castle on arrival there have sent jose to join harry bring news to of day on boat must arrive dia bertie be packing bag of former took with ample supply to get gold out on rock facing entrance so that must be shipped without delay great pain be taken in packing bag so that three ingot placed in must be completely surrounded by stone anyone who might take fancy to feel in order to ascertain content must have reason to suppose that carried anything beyond ore be stated to contain harry have have difficulty in arranging with captain of london to take from ton half to two

anything of swell must not get out again a approached place harry gave shout be at once answered sail be lowered boat passed round edge of rock be rum place mate repeated why one might have rowed past here fifty time without thinking there be water inside rock of course must have lowered sack down from top be difficult job harry said carelessly be anxious to get thing away quietly if have taken down to port must have have end of bother hundred men must have set off at once to try find out where got ore bertie dia have everything ready a boat drew up alongside rock on be standing former said
