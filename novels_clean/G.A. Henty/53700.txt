careful attention to work by private study of science of mining have raised to position of viewer underground foreman mine having be found to be badly ventilated dangerous step be being taken to put right a event of following story show be too late one day when jack came up from round at ten o'clock to eat breakfast write up journal of state of mine saw brook owner of mine manager drive up to pit mouth jack shrank back from little window of office where be writing did not look out again until knew that have descended mine did not wish to have appearance of thrusting forward for hour wrote then window of office flew in piece chair danced wall rocked while dull heavy roar like distant thunder burst upon ear jack leaped to foot rushed to door black smoke be pouring up from pit mouth stick piece of wood coal be falling in shower in yard jack saw that worst fear have be realized that terrible explosion have taken place in vaughan pit for moment stood stunned there be knew over three hundred men boy in pit turned faint sick a thought of fate came across then ran towards top of shaft bankman lay insensible at distance of yard from pit where have be thrown by force of explosion two three men came running up with white scared face smoke have nearly ceased already damage be done deadly stillness seemed to reign jack ran into engine house engineman be leaning against wall scared almost fainting be hurt john pull round man first thing be to see if lift be right see one of cage be at bank force of explosion be in upcast shaft just give turn two to engine see if winding gear be right slowly engineman turned on steam there be slight movement then engine stopped little more steam jack said cage have caught may come there be jerk then engine began to work be right jack said whether lower cage be on not stop now wind back get other cage up again doe bell act wonder jack pulled wire when in order struck bell at bottom of shaft then looked at bell hanging over head for answer none came expect wire broken said went out to pit mouth again surface men be gathered round now tip men yard men from coke oven looking wild pale be going down jack said may find poor fellow near bottom ca wait till head man come on ground who will go with want married men for know lad there may be blow at moment will go with one of yard men said stepping forward there be one dependent on too said doe matter to one whether come up again not vaughan pit ii jack brought three safety lamp from lamp room took place in cage with two volunteer lower away shouted go very slowly when get near bottom look out for signal be three minute from moment that cage began to sink to when touched bottom of shaft seemed age to in knew that at moment second explosion might come that might be driven far up into air above top of shaft mere scorched fragment of flesh not word be spoken during descent there be general exclamation of thank god when felt cage touch bottom jack a official of mine at once took lead now said let push straight up main road just a stepped out came across body of two men stooped over with lamp dead jack said can hing for little way on be waggon thrown together in heap broken up body of pony that of lad driver then came to first door door no longer not fragment of remaining in door boy niche lad lay in heap bent over be alive jack said will two carry to cage will look round see if there be one else about here beyond way there be hope make haste look how gas be catching inside lamp place be full of fire damp men took up lad turned to go to bottom of shaft jack went few yard down cross road then followed be in act of turning into next road to glance at also when felt rush of air down on face shouted springing couple of pace farther up cross road threw on face there be mighty roar thundering sound a of express train blinding light scorching heat jack felt lifted from ground by force of blast dashed down again then knew be over staggered to foot force of explosion have passed along main road so up shaft owed life to fact that have be in side road off course returned into main road near bottom of shaft be brought to standstill roof have fallen passage be blocked with fragment of rock broken waggon knew that bottom of shaft must be partly filled up that comrade be killed that there be hope of escape in direction for moment paused to consider then turning up side road to left ran at full speed from shaft knew that danger now be not so much from fire damp explosive gas a from even more dreaded choke damp surely follows after explosion many more miner be killed by choke damp a hasten to bottom of shaft after explosion than by fire choke damp be carbonic acid gas be heavier than ordinary air thus lowest part of colliery become first filled with a must with water in coal mine there be slight sometimes considerable inclination dip a be called of otherwise flat bed of coal shaft be almost always sunk at lower end of mine a by mean whole pit naturally drain to well at bottom of shaft from there be pumped up by engine above loaded waggon too be run down from working to bottom of shaft with comparative ease vaughan pit iii explosion have a jack well knew destroyed door direct current of air ventilation have entirely ceased lower part of mine where explosion have be strongest must soon be filled with choke damp jack be making for old working near upper boundary line of pit there air must remain pure long after have become poisonous elsewhere be in quarter of mine bill haden jack adopted father twenty other collier worked presently jack saw light ahead heard clattering of step be clear that a have hoped miner working there have escaped force of explosion have without doubt played awful havoc in part of mine where greater part of men be at work stop stop jack shouted a came up to be fire jack bill haden who be one of first asked yes bill did feel of thought felt suck of air quarter hour since be sure then came blew out light come along lad there be time for talking be of use going on jack said shaft choked up came down after first blow fear there be living soul in new working by time must be full of choke damp men looked at other with blank face have seen brook jack asked eagerly yes passed stall with johnstone ten minute ago just before blast came may catch in time to stop yet jack said if have gone round to look at walling of old working there be three men at work there will go with jack bill haden said best place be stall lad went on turning to others be pretty well highest ground in pit air will keep good there a long a anywhere maybe till help come come along with mate said turning to man who worked with in stall a hurried along jack in few word told what have taken place a far a knew five minute run brought to place where mason be at work walling up entrance to old working looked astonished at newcomer have seen mr brook yes manager have just gone on there see light down heading well saw moment since come along jack said quick expect have met at full speed hurried along presently stopped short light burnt low choking sensation came on back jack for life gasped bill haden at moment jack foot struck something knew be body down at foot help cried stooped tried to raise body then last gleam of light went out lung seemed to cease acting saw more vaughan pit iv when came to again be being carried on bill haden shoulder right dad said be coming round now put down be good job jack thought must scarce come round again have got either of others have got brook have arm round so tight that ned lifted together be on ahead mason be carrying ned be showing way can walk now yes be better now how did manage to breathe dad did breathe jack be too old hand for when saw fall just drew back took breath then shut mouth went down for just same a if 'd be groping for under water got hold of lifted up carried along a far a must before drew breath again be sharp jack know everything yet bill haden chuckled to find for once practical experience taught something jack have not learned from book jack now hurried along after bill haden in few minute reached place fixed upon here miner be engaged in restoring mr brook who be just beginning to show sign of life be not until mr brook be able to sit up that began to talk about future jack account of state of thing near shaft be listened to gravely fact that whole of ventilation have be put out of order proof given by second explosion that mine be somewhere on fire be understood sounded death knell gallant unceasing must be effort made under other circumstance to rescue fact that pit be on fire that fresh explosion might at moment take place must make act of simple madness for friend above to try to clear shaft heading to restore ventilation fact be further made clear by sudden flicker of lamp faint shake followed by distant rumble blast bill haden said that settle lad may a well turn out lamp two so a to have light a long a last out be there hope mr brook asked presently coming forward after have heard from haden mate manner in have be so far saved none master said bill haden be like rat in trap must have be kinder of if have let lie a be intention be equally kind mr brook said be there nothing that can hing bill haden said have got dinner with might make last mouthful at time to keep life in for week more what must be use of may be week ay month before can stifle fire make way here can suggest nothing jack mr brook asked be only officer of pit left now added with faint smile jack have not spoken since reached stall have sat down on block of coal with elbow on knee chin on hand favourite attitude of when thinking deeply vaughan pit v other collier have thrown down on ground sobbed a thought of loved one above lay in silence jack answered by rising to foot yes sir think may do something men raised in surprise in first place sir must send men in direction to see how near choke damp have got there be four road by must come up must shut door on side of place have got to roll block of coal rubbish to keep tight stop up chink with wet mud will keep gas from coming up there be air enough in stall heading to last long time must only prolong life for few day jack know must be advantage better to be choked by gas than to die of starvation mr brook said murmur from men showed that agreed with vote for lighting pipe one of miner said if there be fiery gas here must be better to finish with at once there be general expression of approval wait jack said wait till have done know mr brook be close to north boundary here in place within very few yard now 'logan lie next to have be worked out year ago of course be full of water be from fear of tapping that water that work be stopped here good deal come in through coal in stall expect be nearest to now if must work into 'logan water must rush down into working a pit be good deal bigger than 'logan ever be will fill lower working put out fire wo reach here then can get up through 'logan where air be sure to be all right a water will bring good air down with may not do in time be chance what do say sir be worth trying at rate mr brook said bravo lad clear head may save yet now lad mr brook continued jack simpson be master now will work under order before begin boy let say prayer be in god hand let ask protection head be bared men stood reverently while in few word mr brook prayed for strength protection rescue from danger now jack said when have finished give order jack at once sent off two men along of road to find how near choke damp have approached to block up seal door be necessary to strike light to relight of lamp be danger must not be helped rest of men be sent round to place where work have be going on to bring in tool dinner to stall to jack bill haden mr brook proceeded at once work have be done there for year floor be covered with black mud close examination of face showed tiny streamlet of water trickling down in several place be therefore determined to begin work in mean to use powder jack bill haden asked dad without ventilation must be choked with smoke there must be danger from gas when think be getting near water will put in big shot so a to blow in face vaughan pit vi when men returned with tool dinner latter done up in handkerchief jack asked mr brook to take charge of food there be just twenty of sir without nineteen dinner so if divide among four dinner day will last for five day by time hope will be free four men only must work at face of stall together jack divided twenty into five set will work in quarter of hour shift at first said that will give hour rest to quarter of hour work man can work well know for quarter of hour when get done up will have half hour shift will give two hour for sleep in between men of first shift set to work without instant delay vigour swiftness with blow fell upon face of rock told that men who struck be working for life death jack took others into next stall set to work to clear narrow strip of floor next to upper wall be then to cut little groove in rocky floor to catch water a slowly trickled in lead to small hollow be to make in solid rock water coming through two stall must thus collected be ample for want jack then started to see how men at work at door be getting on have already nearly finished task on road leading to main working choke damp have be met with at distance of fifty yard from stall upon upper road be several hundred yard before be found on other two road be over hundred yard men have torn strip off flannel jacket have thrust into crevice of door have then plastered mud from roadway thickly on there be now reason to fear new rush of choke damp unless indeed explosion must take place so violent a to blow in door however be unlikely a with fire burning gas must ignite a came out although there might be many smaller explosion there must scarcely be one so serious a first two have taken place work at door water being over men gathered in stall then jack insisted on equal division of tobacco of almost miner possessed now that be together again lamp be put out save two required by men at work with work to be done hope of ultimate escape men spirit rose between spell talked now then even laugh be heard mr brook although unable to do share of work be very valuable in aiding to keep up spirit by hopeful talk by story of people who have be in great danger in many way in different part of world who have at last escaped sometimes one other of men must propose hymn then deep voice must rise together while blow of sledge pick must keep time to swing of tune on advice of mr brook men divided portion of food small a be into two part one to be eaten twelve hour for a work must proceed night day be better to eat however little twelve hour than to go twenty four without food vaughan pit vii first twenty four hour over stall rather heading for be now driven a narrow a be possible for four men to work at once have greatly advanced indeed must have be difficult even for miner to believe that so much work have be done in time there be however change in appearance water still trickled in must not see that came faster than before a fast a coal fell be removed by one of men who be next for work so that there be not minute lost from cause during next twenty four hour almost a much work be done a during first upon third there be decided falling off scanty food be telling upon now shift be lengthened to hour to allow longer time for sleep between spell of work set of men when relieved threw down exhausted slept for three hour until be turn to wake up remove coal a set at work got down at end of seventy two hour water be coming through face much faster than at first old miner accustomed to judge by sound be of opinion that wall in front sounded le solid that be coming to old working of logan pit in three day night have driven heading nearly fifteen yard from point where have begun upon fourth day worked carefully driving borer three foot ahead of into coal a in case of water bursting through suddenly must all be drowned at end of ninety hour from time of striking first blow drill jack holding bill haden be just driving in deeper with sledge suddenly went forward a suddenly flew out a if shot from gun followed by jet of water driven with tremendous force plug have be prepared in readiness be with difficulty driven into hole two men who have be knocked down by force of water be picked up much bruised hurt with thankful heart that end of labour be at hand prepared for last part of task after earnest thanksgiving by mr brook for success thus far whole party partook of what be heartier meal than usual consisting of whole of remaining food then choosing largest of drill hole be driven in coal two foot in depth in unusually heavy charge be placed be done for after bill haden suddenly exclaimed look at lamp one present felt heart sink at what saw light flame seemed to fill whole interior of lamp to strike match to light fuse must be to cause instant explosion of gas place where be working being highest part of mine fiery gas made way out of coal at point above closed door have being lighter than air mounted there put lamp out jack said quickly gauze be nearly red hot in moment be in darkness vaughan pit viii what be to be done now mr brook asked after pause there be silence for while case seemed desperate mr brook jack said after time be agreed be not that here will obey order yes certainly jack mr brook answered whatever be yes whatever be very well jack said will all take coat off soak in water then set to work to beat gas out of heading a far a possible when be done a far a can be done go into next stall lie down at upper end will be out of way of explosion there cover head with wet coat bill wrap something wet round can of powder what then jack be jack said will fire train if gas explodes at match will light fuse so that wall will blow in anyhow chorus of voice said will be killed will light jack bill haden said be getting on now be great odds about dad jack said be in charge be for to do have promised to obey order so set about at once bill take mr brook up first into other stall wo be able to find way about in dark without word bill did a be told mr brook giving one hearty squeeze to lad hand a be led away others accustomed to darkness from boyhood proceeded at once to carry out jack instruction wetting flannel jacket then beating roof with towards entrance to stall for five minute continued then jack said now lad off to stall a quick a can cover head well over lie down will be with in minute a jack knew well must be dashed to piece by explosion of gas listened until sound of last footstep died away waited couple of minute to allow to get safely in position at other end of next stall then holding end of fuse in one hand match in other murmured prayer stooping to ground struck match explosion followed applied to fuse ran for life down narrow heading down stall along horse road up next stall be alight said a rushed in cheer burst from men cover head close jack said a threw down explosion be sure to fire gas for minute silence a of death reigned in mine then there be sharp cracking explosion followed by like thunder while flash of fire seemed to surround filling air firing clothes scorching limb whole mine shook with deep roaring men knew that danger be at end threw off covering from head struck out fire from garment be badly burned about leg word cry may have uttered be drowned in tremendous roar continued be water from logan pit rushing into vaughan for five minute noise be like thunder then a pressure from behind decreased sound gradually grew le until in five minute be quiet vaughan pit ix then men rose to foot air in next stall be clear fresh for a logan pit have emptied of water fresh air have of course come down from surface to take place can light lamp again safely now bill haden said will want tool lad powder there may be heavy fall in way may have hard work yet before get to shaft roof rock be strong so believe will make way lie to right jack said like own be at lower end of pit so a long a mount be going right for there be a haden have expected many heavy fall of roof water have swept passage in be found easier to get along than collier have expected still be hard work for men weakened by hunger took five hour of labour clearing away mass of rock floundering through black mud often three foot deep before made way to bottom of logan shaft then saw light far above light at one time have never expected to see again what o'clock be now sir bill haden asked mr brook who have from beginning be time keeper of party twelve o'clock exactly replied be four day hour since pit caught fire what day be sir for have lost count of time sunday mr brook said after moment thought must not be better bill haden said for there will be thousand of people from round to visit mine how much powder have bill jack asked four twenty pound can let let off ten pound at time jack said just damp enough to prevent from flashing off too suddenly break up fine of damp wood mix with will add to smoke in few minute powder be ready light applied blazed furiously for minute sending volume of light smoke up shaft flash off couple of pound of dry powder bill haden said there be very little draught up shaft will drive air up for twenty minute continued flashing powder then stopped allowed shaft to clear altogether of smoke presently small stone fell among knew that one have noticed smoke be indeed true smoke signal have be seen understood before long be drawn safely to surface may be imagined what excitement there be woman crowded about jack calling down blessing on for saving husband son sweetheart from death mr brook be not slow to recognize bravery skill knew that if jack suggestion have be attended to explosion might not have happened so young collier be made manager of mine red captain from one of th ralph conway young officer of th regiment be stationed with detachment on south coast of ireland news be obtained that notorious gang led by ruffian known a red captain be in hiding among cliff news came from woman whose husband have against will be forced to join band captain o'connor

men must cut off escape by sea daylight be faintly breaking when reached edge of cliff ralph with ten men be posted at spot where slight track be visible going down into sort of gulley captain o'connor then proceeded with company to right desmond taking remainder to left posting men at interval along edge of cliff placing party of four at point where there appeared smallest probability of ascent being made be ordered to load at once be to seize anyone coming up cliff in case of resistance to fire without hesitation two officer then returned to spot where have left ralph be now nearly broad daylight leaving soldier went short distance to point where rock fell away precipitately from here have clear view of face of cliff have better wait here for time captain said chance be that before long one of will come out from hiding place perhaps make way up to top to look round if doe will give indication a to direction at rate of hiding place now will take ground in front do watch to left conway to right desmond have better lie down for on jutting point may catch eye of anyone down there before can see keep sharp look out lad will save world of trouble if can see one of for hour lay quiet then desmond suddenly exclaimed there be man among fallen rock way up side there be gone perhaps will see again in moment for five minute lay with eye fixed on rock desmond pointed out there be sign of life be sure be not mistaken desmond o'connor asked quite certain suddenly appeared by side of gray boulder stood there for moment sunk down again expect must have got view of one of men

over rock because if of fall musket may go off shoot someone in front of wherever be possible scatter out abreast of other so a to prevent possibility of accident now then march leading way captain o'connor descended little track extended short distance beyond chaos of fallen rock remains of old landslip stretched away to shore there be working along side way desmond captain o'connor said after have climbed along for little distance have better make straight down to shore follow for bit then mount again to spot where saw man be difficult work at last party reached shore lieutenant adcock who be in command of boat have watched party making way down rock now rowed in to within few yard of good morning lieutenant captain o'connor said think have got fairly trapped doubtless must have made off if have seen on watch outside be that notorious scoundrel red captain of galway who be hear hiding here with gang indeed revenue officer said will be capture worth making will come ashore with four of men expect be more accustomed to climbing about among rock than yours be must like to lend hand do by mean captain o'connor replied see have got ten six will be quite enough in boat even if do manage to get down embark think will men be armed suppose yes have carbine cutlass now coxswain leave in charge row out quarter of mile if boat push off be to stop arrest on board will almost certainly resist in case must use arm now four bow oar get out step ashore red captain iii when lieutenant four men have landed boat again pushed off party on shore made way along over rock at edge of water until be opposite rock where lieutenant desmond have seen man appear then ascent be commenced four officer went first men following in line bear little to left captain o'connor said be likely to lie somewhere in direction man saw must have be making towards path not from keep sharp look out between great rock there be saying where entrance to hiding place may be almost a spoke there be sharp crack of rifle bullet struck rock on be standing come on lad shouted sooner be there le time have got to fire with cheer men hurried forward scrambling recklessly over rock again again puff of smoke darted out from rock in front one of soldier fell shot through heart stop to fire captain o'connor shouted a yell of rage broke from men will do good will only give more time dozen more shot be fired one of coast guard men be shot through shoulder be only casualty for quick movement of men a scrambled over boulder disconcerted aim of above breathless panting four officer gained spot from shot have be fired men close up behind not soul be to be seen wait moment till get breath lad leader said ca be far from here will find hiding place presently never fear a stood panting there be shout from above soldier be standing along edge of cliff looking down upon fight sergeant morris waved arm have made away to left sir shouted at top of voice have just caught sight of among rock in two three minute captain o'connor led way in direction keep eye sharply about lad doubt place be cunningly hidden search among clump of bush between rock presently sergeant shouted down again from above think be far enough now sir did not catch sight of beyond for hour search continued without avail must be here somewhere lad captain o'connor said will find if have to stop here week have provision brought down from village be pretty evident there be opening between great rock must have found must examine smaller boulder may have one so placed that can be dropped down over entrance flat slab be likely looking place for instance three four of get hold of heave up men gathered round to lift ralph stooped down peeped under a did so hurrah shouted there be opening here several of others now got hold of stone be up ended thrown backwards entrance to passage three foot high two foot wide be revealed red captain iv can smell peat fire one of men exclaimed be entrance doubt captain o'connor said see bottom be evidently worn by foot passage must have be used for long time be awkward place to follow desperate men into be indeed lieutenant adcock agreed must shoot down one by one a go in must see against light while must be able to make out nothing surrender in there captain o'connor shouted ca get away promise fair trial summons be followed by taunting laugh moment later there be sharp sound within rifle bullet struck side of entrance flew out must be throwing away one life to go in there captain o'connor said at rate have got secure must come out in time must be madness to crawl in there on one hand foot to be picked off by scoundrel at ease now lad two of stand by entrance keep out of line of fire be ready with bayonet to run anyone through who come out let rest scatter search round place may have entrance if so must find in first place may be easier of entry in second might escape from after dark again search began do think be likely to be higher up lower down o'connor lieutenant desmond asked there be saying desmond a passage seems to go straight in must fancy above rather than below for long time searched without success then ralph who have gone higher up rock than rest came upon clump of low bush growing between large boulder there be nothing suspicious about be just turning away when perceived slight odour of peat smoke silently made way down to captain have found entrance said at rate think so for certainly smelt smoke if go quietly may take unawares captain o'connor passed word along for men to gather silently ralph then led way up to clump of bush yes can smell peat plainly enough now conway do search among bush carefully lad know what place be like cautiously ralph pushed bush aside saw at once that have be carefully trained to cover large hole be about three foot wide descended at sharp angle forming sloping passage of sufficient height for man to stand upright captain o'connor knelt down looked in look more possible said be very steep must say be not used by act a sort of chimney to ventilate cavern let smoke out at rate will try must take boot off so a to get better hold on rock besides will make le noise blunt jervis do go down to other entrance again be likely enough that may try to make bolt way if hear coming keep sharp look out down there be sure one escape think captain o'connor will be good thing to enter from there also moment row be heard going on within attention will be taken up with attack may get in without being noticed be very good idea conway will carry out take two more men with make way in a soon a hear engaged remember that be quite possible may not be able to get down passage may get almost perpendicular presently though mean to go if possible even if have straight drop for may close up be altogether impracticable so try to enter till be quite sure be engaged with otherwise will be only throwing away life understand sir ralph said a turned to go off if get in can reckon on assistance immediately if not will make move red captain v ralph now took up station at mouth of cavern with six men lay down just in front of opening listening attentively must hear continued murmur a of many

upon ruffian back fell to ground together blunderbuss going off in fall riddling soldier standing next to ralph with slug for two three minute desperate struggle went on between ralph six men who attempted to break through sturdily a soldier fought have be driven back towards entrance by assailant armed with pike clubbed gun there be sound of conflict at other end of cave ralph felt that attack there have for reason failed shoulder to shoulder lad shouted will have help in minute two have emptied double barrelled pistol sword have just broken short in hand while guarding head from heavy blow have be almost struck to ground when there be rush of men from behind rest of soldier poured in give volley lad shouted then charge with bayonet musket rang out then there be shout of

here have full view of prisoner there be still many of scottish birth in town in spite of effort edward have made to convert into complete english colony although english be in majority archie be subject to little insult annoyance although for present in english possession berwick have always be scotch town might yet again by fortune of war fall into scottish hand therefore even most hostile to felt that must be prudent to refrain from demonstration against scottish prisoner since in event of city again changing hand fearful retaliation might be dealt occasionally passing boy must shout out word of contempt hatred throw stone at prisoner such trifle be unheeded by more often men woman passing must stop gaze up at with pitying look must go away wiping eye archie after first careful examination of cell at once abandoned idea of escape from massive bar must have defied strength of twenty men have instrument of sort with must cut there be felt nothing before death although feared little for felt sad indeed a thought of grief of marjory mother day passed slowly five have gone without incident two remained knew that there be chance of change in sentence edward have passed even be son edward ii more disposed than edward have be towards merciful measure to scot that must be case archie have warrant for supposing new king time must be too closely engaged in affair of state arrangement of father funeral detail of army advancing against scotland to give thought to prisoner whose fate have be determined by father absorbed in own thought archie seldom looked across moat paid heed to who passed who paused to look at on afternoon of fifth day however eye be caught by two woman who be gazing up at cage in moment started violently almost gave cry for in one of recognized wife marjory instant that woman saw that have observed turned away walked carelessly slowly along road wife stratagem ii archie must hardly believe that eyesight have not deceived seemed impossible that marjory whom deemed hundred mile away in castle at aberfilly must be here in town of berwick yet when thought over saw that might well be so there be indeed ample time for to have made journey two three time while have be lying in prison at port patrick awaiting ship must be sure when news reached of capture that must be taken to edward at carlisle that must be either executed there at berwick be then by mean impossible strange wondrous a appeared to that marjory must be in berwick be attired in garment of peasant woman of better class such a wife of small crofter farmer remembering

one from estate at ayr whom have known from child in case archie must not account for knowledge of however did not occupy mind many minute be assuredly one whom marjory trusted be sufficient for then thought turned wholly to wife anyone who have noticed prisoner manner for last few day must have be struck with change have come over hitherto have stood often for hour leaning motionless with arm crossed in corner of cage with head bent down listless air thought only being busy now paced restlessly up down narrow limit two step way then turn like caged beast hand be clenched breast heaved breath came fast head be thrown back often brushed hand across eye rapid word came from lip sun sank hour later jailer brought jug of water piece of bread then without word retired leaving a usual door into cell open carefully locking barring inner door archie have longer walk now from front of cage to back of cell for three hour paced up down wife stratagem iii sometimes paused listened attentively sound in town gradually died away became still save that must hear call of warder on battlement above night be very dark one must scarcely make out gleam of water in moat below suddenly something struck sharp blow on face fell at foot stooped picked up be arrow with wad of wool fastened round point to prevent from making noise must strike wall cage to other end be attached piece of string archie drew in until felt that be held firmly then after moment hold relaxed somewhat string again yielded a drew in presently stout rope strong enough to bear weight came into hand at point of junction be attached object done up in flannel opened found that be fine saw small bottle containing oil fastened rope securely to one of bar at once commenced to saw asunder one of others in five minute two cut have be noiselessly made portion of bar five foot long came away now tried rope found that be tightly stretched evidently fixed to object on other side of moat grasped firmly with arm leg slid rapidly down in minute be grasped by strong arm checked rapid progress enabled to gain foot without slightest noise a did so woman threw arm round exchanged passionate silent embrace with marjory then took hand with noiseless step proceeded down road have before starting removed shoe put in pocket marjory companion have also removed shoe even keenest ear upon battlement must have heard

for minute two then aroused companion there be large pack of wolf approaching said by direction of sound judge be hunting on trace of footstep be line by came down from yonder brow seems to that be ascending opposite slope yes by sound there must be very large pack of halcon agreed pile up fire set yourselves to gather more wood a quickly a possible beast in large pack be formidable foe three men set to work vigorously cutting down brushwood lopping off small bough of tree with sword divide fire in four halcon said pile fuel in centre will hardly dare to pas between fire pack be now descending slope keeping up chorus of howl short yelp sent shiver of uneasiness through malchus a wolf approached spot howling suddenly ceased see halcon said keep sharp look out for throw away shot will need arrow before daylight standing perfectly quiet friend must hear pattering sound made by wolf foot upon fallen leaf moon have sunk now be unable to make out figure seems to malchus said in whisper can see speck of fire gleaming on bush be reflection of fire in eye halcon replied see be round there must be score of for time wolf approached closer then encouraged by silence of little group standing in centre of fire two three gray form showed in circle of light three bow twanged two of wolf fell third with howl of pain fled in darkness there be sound of snarling growling cry of pain fierce struggle then long continued snarling what be doing malchus asked with shudder believe be eating wounded comrade halcon replied have heard such be custom of savage brute see carcass of

wolf advanced be necessary to let fire burn down must want four hour yet of daylight halcon said a threw on last piece of wood look round a fire blaze up see if can make out tree may be climbed must that have taken to at first instead of trusting to fire unfortunately have chosen somewhat open space of ground for encampment for brushwood grew thick among tree there be tree over there malchus said pointing to with bough six foot from ground one spring on to be safe very well halcon assented will attempt at once before fire burn low put sword into sheath sling bow arrow behind take burning brand will be better weapon in such case than sword spear now be ready now waving burning brand over head three carthaginian dashed towards tree seemed a if wolf be conscious that prey be attempting to escape for with fierce howl sprang from bush rushed to meet heedless of blazing brand sprang upon malchus scarce knew what passed in short fierce struggle one wolf sprang upon shield nearly brought to ground sharp bos pierced body flung from at same moment that dashed brand full in face of third sprang upon shoulder felt hot breath in face dropping brand drove dagger deep into side then hurled heavy shield among mass of wolf before took bound into midst grasping bough swung into tree sat there with leg drawn up a score of wolf leapt up towards with open mouth gave cry of horror two friend

reached fork where must sit at ease there waited for morning when hoped that foe must disappear a gray light dawned saw still on watch a dawn brightened into day did show sign of moving when saw have intention of leaving place malchus began to consider seriously what have best do might still be for aught knew mile away from camp friend there must have mean of knowing position in be placed must doubt send out soldier in search of party in broken wilderness of forest mountain be merest chance whether must find spot where be prisoner still appeared to that be only possibility of rescue tree grew thickly together must easily have climbed from in be stationed to next might so have made way for distance a wolf be watching must see a well by night a by day there be advantage in shifting position day passed slowly wolf have for most part withdrawn from beneath tree few kept station there steadily malchus knew that rest be lying beneath bush not far off for must hear frequent snarling sometimes gray head be thrust out pair of eager eye looked hungrily towards from time to time malchus listened breathlessly in hope of hearing distant shout of comrade be still in forest felt sure that wolf must hear anyone approaching before must once twice indeed fancied by pricked ear attitude of attention that must hear sound inaudible to alarm if such be soon passed away might have be that be listening only to distant footstep of stag passing through forest battle with wolf iv night came again with long dreary hour malchus strapped by belt to tree to prevent from falling in way managed to obtain few hour of uneasy sleep waking up time with start in cold perspiration of fear believing that be falling into hungry jaw below in morning fierce desire to kill of foe seized descended to lowest branch wolf seeing prey so close at hand thronged thickly under strove to leap up at lying down on bough twisting leg firmly under to give purchase malchus thrust sword nearly to hilt between jaw snapped fiercely a wolf sprang to within few inch of bough several be killed in way rest rendered caution withdrew to short distance suddenly idea struck malchus took off belt formed into running noose then waited until wolf must summon up courage to attack again be not long furious with hunger prey have already devoured be only sufficient to whet wolf again approached began to spring towards bough malchus dropped noose over neck of one with effort hauled to bough despatched with dagger then moved along bough hung on branch ten foot from ground slashing open with dagger chest stomach having done returned to place six wolf be one after other so hauled up despatched a malchus expected smell of blood rendered pack more savage than ever assembled round foot of tree continued to spring at trunk making vain endeavour to get at supply of food hung tantalizingly at so short distance beyond reach so day passed a before without sign of rescue when became dark malchus again descended to lowest bough fired three remaining arrow among wolf below loud howl followed discharge sound of desperate struggle below then tumbled six dead wolf from position to ground below then a noiselessly a possible made way along bough into adjoining tree from passed into till have attained distance from spot where wolf be fighting growling over remains of companion far too absorbed in work for thought of then dropped noiselessly to ground fled at top of speed must be be sure time before wolf have completed feast even must discover that be missing from tree must probably be time before must hit upon scent especially a having just feasted on blood sense of smell must be dulled several time stopped listened in dread lest must hear distant howl must tell that pack be again on scent be quiet save for usual cry noise in forest in two hour saw distant glow of light be soon in encampment of friend cyclone in bay of bengal from chapter of adventure jack robson arthur hill jim tucker be three midshipman on board wild wave when in bay of bengal appearance of weather change captain order most of sail to be taken in what be about arthur hill asked comrade a three boy gathered together after

immediately gave order furl mizzen main topsail lower down fore stay sail well there ca be more to do now jack said when order be carried out unless get to work to set again look jack arthur hill said grasping arm pointing away on starboard beam wall of black mist seemed to hang upon horizon rising moment higher higher squall be coming lad captain shouted when strike hold on for life carpenter put man with axe at of weather shroud may have to cut away before have done with eye be now turned towards bank of cloud be rising with extraordinary rapidity small portion of upper line seemed at time to be torn off to rush ahead of main body then to disappear suddenly blown into fragment low moaning sound be heard line of white must be made out at foot of cloud bank water around ship be still a smooth a glass though there be slight swell swayed to fro caused shroud block to rattle louder louder grew murmur again captain voice be heard hold on for life lad then with scream roar a of thousand railway whistle gale struck ship so tremendous be force although closely reefed fore topsail be only sail that wild wave be showing aloft for jib blew from bolt rope instant squall struck vessel heeled over over until lee rail be under water further further went until end of yard be under water sea seemed to jack who be holding on by weather bulwark a if be directly under foot thought that ship be going to capsize have not cargo be well stowed must have done so be now almost on beam end pressed down by action of wind upon hull rather than mast have not be that boy have at last moment twisted rope round body must have dropped into water for deck afforded hold to foot jack felt completely bewildered at noise fury of wind have thought that after gale have passed through south of cape knew what bad weather be be beyond anything of have slightest conception cyclone ii looking round saw mr timmins clinging to bulwark making way along with greatest difficulty until reached sailor stationed with axe at mizzen shroud saw man rise from crouching position holding on to bulwark strike three blow on lanyard then there be crash mizzen mast broke suddenly off four foot above deck fell into sea jack thought that vessel lifted little for must see one more streak of deck planking mr timmins looked round towards captain who be clinging to wheel latter waved hand mate again began to make way forward passed boy without word for loudest shout must have be inaudible in howling of wind stopped at main shroud again axe descended mainmast went over side relief from weight of mast pressure of wind upon be immediate wild wave rose with surge lee rail appeared above surface then rose further mr timmins looked back again at captain latter made sign must see that pressure of wind upon foremast be beginning to pay vessel head off before a did so slowly righted until when fairly before wind be upon level keel then there be dull explosion heard even above gale fore topsail split into ribbon ship be now before gale be scudding from effect of wind on bare pole hull alone at great speed through water a soon a have righted lad threw off lashing still clung tight to rail struggled aft till stood under shelter of poop be something like jim roared at top of voice into jack ear even then word must scarcely be heard jack nodded at present even have conversation be possible must have have inclination for for felt stunned bewildered have taken place in ten minute be that time since ship have be lying motionless on still ocean now be rushing with one mast only standing before furious gale have have narrowest possible escape from destruction a yet sea have scarce begun to rise seemed flattened under terrific pressure of wind scooped hollow in drove water before in fine spray jack have read in paper about tornado in america how house be sometimes bodily lifted with content carried long distance how everything above surface be swept away a if scythe have passed over have heard account discussed by fisherman general opinion in leigh jack home be that there be mighty little truth in leigh men thought knew what gale be what must do knew chimney pot tile must be carried distance with wind that arm of tree must be twisted off that empty boat must be carried considerable distance that house must be bodily whirled away be going so far beyond anything came within experience a to be wholly disbelieved jack knew now a looked round that more be possible felt whole vessel leap quiver a gust struck with only one bare pole standing must have be scarcely surprised now have ship be lifted bodily from water cyclone iii a to walking along deck must have be impossible man must have forced way against wind jack felt be to attempt to move from sheltered spot where be standing must be taken up carried away a if be figure of straw presently mr hoare came down from poop dived into cabin making sign to lad to follow stood there for minute panting with exertion captain have sent down for spell said first jack moore be lashed to wheel sometimes thought that four of wheel must have be blown right away well lad be cyclone may live hundred year never see such have better stop in here for might get blown right away can be of good on deck there be nothing to do wind have got will take where like can hing keep straight there will be tremendous sea before long water at upper part of bay be willow will have sea like yours at mouth of thames jack only on big scale life be in god hand boy forget to ask for help where alone can be obtained now must go up again

live to be white headed after jack moore have gone up mr timmins captain came down by turn took cup of cocoa said few word to boy be indeed almost too much exhausted by struggle through have gone to be able to speak boy gathered again under lee of poop watched scene have changed considerably wind seemed a violent a ever sea be no longer kept in subjection to be now tossing in wild confused manner half hour have settled into sort of regularity be sweeping before wind in deep trough like wave with steep side resembling to jack have be accustomed at home on gigantic scale soon again be broken up be succeeded by wild tumultuous sea like boiling cauldron vessel be thrown violently from side to side taking water over now on one beam now on other at time shaking from blow a if have struck upon rock so sharp sudden be movement that lad must not keep foot again made way into cabin even here be necessary to shout in order to be heard cyclone iv what extraordinary sea jim never saw anything like before be what doe jim replied pointing to tell tale compass hanging from beam overhead jack glanced at why be running due south aye expect have be two three time round compass already be what make frightful broken sea well a long a keep on running round round jack said there be fear of running against land anywhere jim be further advanced in study of navigation forget said centre of cyclone be moving along time though may go round round centre be still moving in same direction a cyclone be going whatever may be for hour storm raged without slightest sign of abatement sea be now terrific waist of ship be full of water green sea swept over vessel bow carrying everything before pouring aft burst open cabin door deluged cabin by turn boy made way to door looked out come out fellow jim tucker shouted after one of trip of investigation men be coming out from fo'castle there be something to be done boy came out crawled few step up poop ladder holding on for life a did so did not attempt to get on to poop for felt must be blown away if exposed there to full force of wind looking round scene be terrible surface of sea be almost hidden by cloud of spray blown from head of wave sky be inky black hung overhead sea save for white head be of similar hue ahead there seemed gleam of light jim tucker holding on by rail raised two three foot higher to have better view moment be sufficient sprang down again shouted in comrade ear breaker ahead needed further word light ahead be gleam of sea of white foam towards vessel be hurrying nothing must be done to check change course have mizzen be standing effort might have be made to show little sail upon bring head up into wind to anchor even must have be done cable must have snapped like pack thread there be nothing for destruction jack followed jim example crawled to top of gangway holding on by poop rail raised to foot looked forward right across bow stretched band of white breaker beyond through mist must make out line of low shore lad descended again into waist with great difficulty made way forward to where men be huddled together round entrance to fo'castle too have kept look out knew of danger into be running impossibility of avoiding be there anything to be done jim tucker shouted silent shake of head be sufficient answer vessel in be doomed officer be now seen leaving helm coming forward be proof in of hopelessness of prospect vessel be indeed steering straight before gale a there be regular following wave there be fear of broaching to boat have at commencement of storm be hanging from davit be gone useless one two have be smashed to piece by heavy sea striking others have be torn from fastening blown clean away long boat alone remained lashed amidships on deck jack pointed to old sailor shook head pointed to sea boat must hope to live in minute once in breaker must be swamped instantly officer made way forward be over lad captain shouted of may reach shore on piece of wreck a break up will get long boat ready for launching of may cling to now lad let shake hand round meet fate a british sailor must do calmly bravely perhaps who know of may be saved yet cyclone v crew of wild wave have be happy one discipline have be good although indulgence have be allowed men be fond of officer there be silent hand clasp round then of sailor followed officer to boat a did so knew well that order be given merely to keep employed for that chance of anyone being washed ashore reaching alive through tremendous surf be small indeed a cut away boat cover looked round low cry broke from several of ship be close to broken water man clung to something awaited shock in few second came a descended wave there be tremendous shock followed instantaneously by crash a foremast went over bow accompanied time with sound of rending timber cut away lashing of boat captain shouted drawing knife setting example a did so touched jack pointed into bottom of boat lad understood be to put in plug at ordinary time be left out to allow rain water to escape a fell jack in turn touched arthur two climbed into boat to replace plug a did so fiercer gust than usual struck vessel lashing of long boat have just be cut gale seized raised in air a if have be made of paper jack arthur uttered cry involuntarily clung for life to thwart over over be whirled confused giddy scarce knowing what have happened clung on be sort of nightmare how long lasted knew not presently there be terrific crash knew more when jack opened eye lay for time wondering where be what have become of there be star in sky overhead light be stealing over felt that be daybreak there be loud dull roaring sound in ear sound must not understand for not even breath of wind fanned cheek at last slowly fact came to mind there have be great storm vessel be among breaker have got into long boat with arthur to put in plug have be lifted up blown away then suddenly jack sat upright be light enough for to see that be still in boat back be broken side staved in around be mass of tangled foliage close beside lay arthur hill blood slowly oozing from terrible gash in forehead jack leaned over raised loudly shouted name in ear with sigh arthur opened eye what be jack asked feebly be saved old man have be blown right ashore in boat have got shaken hurt bit thank god be alive where be arthur asked looking round a far a can see jack replied be in middle of grove of tree have be blown down by gale leaf branch have broken fall otherwise must have be smashed up must have be lying here for last ten hour be just about six o'clock when struck for looked at clock in cabin last time be down there a sun will be up before long must be getting on for five now now let try to get out of with greatest difficulty for be still weak terribly shaken boy made way through tangle of tree branch into have so providentially fallen uttered exclamation of surprise a reached edge of wood sea be nearly mile away tremendous surf be still breaking for quarter of mile out band of white breaker extended along shore there be sign of wild wave flood in pine tree gulch from tale of daring danger lad known a white faced dick in mining camp in california have received much rough kindness from miner called red george heavy rain have fallen among hill channel through stream running through valley have be diverted be insufficient to carry away water came down dick who be weakly lad altogether unfitted for rough work of mining have made up mind to go east to native village a be sitting thinking over thought came back to pine tree gulch started to foot must be mistaken be eye deceiving among stone boulder of old bed of yuba there be gleam of water even a watched must see widening out started to run down hill to give alarm before be half way paused for there be loud shout scene of bustle confusion instantly arose cradle be deserted men working on surface loaded with tool made for high ground while at windlass worked hardest to draw up comrade below man coming down from above stopped close to dick with low cry stood gazing with white scared face dick have worked with be one of company to keel george belonged what be saunders be lost man replied be at windlass when shouted up to to go up fetch something from hut have just struck gold rich dick understood at once red george mate be still in bottom of shaft ignorant of danger be threatening come on cried will be in time yet at top of speed dashed down hill followed by saunders what be what be asked party of men mounting hill red george gang be still below dick eye be fixed on water there be broad band now of yellow with white edge down centre of stony flat be widening with terrible rapidity be scarce ten yard from windlass at top of red george shaft when dick followed closely by saunders reached come up mate quick for life river be rising will be flooded out directly one else have gone a spoke pulled at rope by bucket be hanging handle of windlass flew round rapidly a descended when have run out dick grasped handle right below answering call came up two began work throwing whole strength into quickly a windlass revolved seemed endless time to dick before bucket came up first man stepped out be not red george dick have hardly expected must be red george must be sure to see two mate up before man uttered cry of alarm a saw water now within few foot of mouth of shaft flood in pine tree gulch ii be torrent now for not only be coming through dam be rushing down in cascade from new channel without word miner placed facing dick moment bucket be again down three grasped handle quickly a worked edge of water be within few inch of shaft when next man reached surface again bucket descended before rope tightened however water have began to run over lip at first in mere trickle then almost instantaneously in cascade grew larger larger bucket be way up when sound like thunder be heard ground seemed to tremble under foot then at turn of valley above great wave of yellow water crested with foam be seen tearing along at speed of race horse dam have burst saunders shouted run for life be lost three men dropped handle ran at full speed towards shore while loud shout to dick to follow came from crowd of men standing on slope boy still grasped handle with lip tightly closed still toiled on slowly bucket ascended for red george be heavy man then suddenly weight slackened handle went round faster shaft be filling water have reached bucket have risen to red george neck so that weight be no longer on rope so fast did water pour in be not minute before bucket reached surface red george sprang out there be time for one exclamation then great wave struck red george be whirled like straw in current be strong swimmer at point where valley widened out mile lower struggled to shore two day later news reached pine tree gulch that boy body have be washed ashore twenty mile down ten men headed by red george went brought solemnly back to pine tree gulch there among stump of pine tree grave be dug there in presence of whole camp white faced dick be laid to rest pine tree gulch be solitude now tree be growing again none must dream that be once busy scene of industry if traveller search among pine tree will find stone with word here lie white faced dick who died to save red george can man do more than give life for friend red george worked more at digging after seeing stone laid in place went east bought small farm settled down there to end of life be never weary of telling who must listen to story of pine tree gulch brush with chinese what came of from tale of daring danger be early in december that hm perseus be cruising off mouth of canton river war have be declared with china in consequence of continued evasion of treaty have made with be expected that strong naval force must soon gather to bring to reason in meantime ship on station have busy time of chasing enemy junk when ventured to show beyond reach of gun of fort occasionally having brush with piratical boat took advantage of general confusion to plunder friend a well a foe perseus have that afternoon chased two government junk up creek sun have already set when took refuge there captain did not care to send boat after in dark a many of creek ran up for mile into flat country a creek not unfrequently have many arm branch boat might in dark miss junk altogether order be issued that four boat must be ready for starting at next morning perseus anchored off mouth of creek two boat be ordered to row backwards forward off mouth night to ensure that enemy did not slip out in darkness jack fothergill senior midshipman be commanding gig two of other midshipman be going in pinnace launch commanded respectively by first lieutenant master three other midshipman of perseus be loud in lamentation that be not to share in fun ca all go know fothergill said be use making noise about captain have be very good to let three of go be very well for jack percy adcock youngest of lad replied because be one of chosen be not so hard for simmons linthorpe because went other day in boat chased junk under shelter of gun of battery have have chance for ever so long what fun be there in chasing junk simmons said never got near chinese till be close to battery then just a first shot came singing from gun

oliphant for captain order be strict that be not to try to cut junk out if got under gun of of battery still be horribly annoying do think captain might have remembered what bad luck have last time given chance to morrow be clear must not go fothergill said naturally enough captain chose three senior besides if did have bad luck last time have chance suppose will have anything more exciting now fellow always set fire to junk row for shore directly see after firing shot two wildly in direction well jack if expect fun simmons replied perhaps must mind telling first lieutenant care to go that be very anxious to take place perhaps will be good enough to allow to relieve likely thing fothergill laughed tom be sorry be not going must make best of till chance come think jack percy adcock said to senior in coaxing tone later on must manage to smuggle into boat with not percy suppose got hurt what must captain say then firing a wildly a chinese do shot be just a likely to hit little carcass a to lodge in one of sailor must just make best of percy promise that next time there be boat expedition if be not put in will say good word to first lieutenant for promise be better than nothing boy

clambered down by ladder took place then fothergill took seat in stern boat pushed off lay few length away from ship until heavier boat put off a soon a be under weigh percy crawled out from hiding place placed in bow where be sheltered by body of oarsman from fothergill sight day be just breaking now be still dark on water boat rowed very slowly until became lighter percy must just make out shore of creek on side be two three foot above level of water be evidently submerged at high tide creek be about hundred yard wide lad must not see far ahead for be full of sharp winding turning here there branch joined boat be evidently following main channel after half hour rowing first lieutenant suddenly gave order easy men looking over shoulder saw village quarter of mile ahead with two junk have chased night before lying in front of almost at same moment sudden uproar be heard drum be beaten gong sounded be on look out for first lieutenant said mr mason do keep with attack junk highest

lieutenant heard word row on men let finish with craft ahead before others get out must be that piratical village have heard about mr mason a lying up one of creek account for two junk not going higher up be surprised at seeing here for might guess that must try to get morning evidently expected to catch in trap brush with chinese iii percy be delighted at finding that in excitement caused by news first lieutenant have forgotten to take notice of being there without order returned defiant nod to threat conveyed by fothergill shaking fist at a neared junk fire of on board redoubled be aided by of many villager gathered on bank of creek suddenly from bank of rush four cannon be fired ball struck pinnace smashing in side other boat gathered hastily round took crew on board then dashed at junk be hundred yard distant valour of chinese evaporated a saw boat approaching score of leapt overboard swam for shore in minute boat be alongside crew scrambling up side of junk only few chinaman attempted to oppose be speedily overcome british have now time to look round saw that six junk crowded with men have issued from side creek be making towards let boat tow astern lieutenant ordered must have to run gauntlet of battery on shore if be to attack might lose boat before reached side will fight here junk approached on board firing gun yelling shouting while drum gong be furiously beaten will find mistaken percy if think be going to frighten with noise fothergill said young rascal how did get on board boat without being seen captain will be sure to suspect have hand in concealing tar be now at work firing matchlock with deck be strewn at approaching junk a took steady aim leaning piece on bulwark did considerable execution among chinaman crowded on board junk while shot of chinese for most part whistled far overhead gun of shore battery have now be slewed round to bear upon opened with better aim several shot came crashing into side of captured junk get ready to board lad fothergill shouted wait for to board moment come alongside lash rigging to ours spring on board leading junk be now about twenty yard away presently grated alongside dozen sailor at once sprang into rigging with rope after lashing junk together leaped down upon deck where fothergill be leading gig crew of rescued from pinnace while mr bellew with party have boarded at stern several of chinese fought stoutly greater part lost heart at seeing attacked many began at once to jump overboard after two three minute sharp fighting rest followed example be beaten below brush with chinese iv fothergill looked round other junk have be attacked by two of enemy one on side little body of sailor be gathered in waist be defending against overwhelming number of enemy other three piratical junk have be carried somewhat up creek by tide be sweeping inward must not for moment take part in fight mr oliphant be hard pressed sir asked master will take to boat will be best plan mr bellew replied quick lad get boat alongside tumble in there be not moment to be lost crew at once sprang to boat rowed to other junk be thirty yard away chinese absorbed in contest with crew of pinnace did not perceive new comer until gained deck with shout fell furiously upon in surprise consternation pirate did not pause to note that be still five to one superior in number made rush for own vessel english at once took offensive first lieutenant with party boarded one while new comer leapt on to deck of other panic have seized chinese be so complete that attempted resistance whatever sprang overboard in great number swam to shore be twenty yard away in three minute english be in undisputed possession of vessel back again mr fothergill will lose craft captured lieutenant oliphant said have already cut free chinese indeed who have be beaten below by boarding party have soon perceived sudden departure of captor gaining deck again have cut lashing fastened to other junk be proceeding to hoist sail be too late however almost before craft have way on fothergill crew be alongside chinese did not wait for attack at once sprang overboard made for shore other three junk seeing capture of comrade have already hoisted sail be making up creek fothergill dropped anchor left four of men in charge rowed back to mr oliphant what will do next sir will give fellow on shore lesson silence battery two men

feel that cord be being unwound be dropped on to foot then cloth be removed from head must look round dozen chinese armed with matchlock bristling with sword dagger stood around among bound like gagged by piece of bamboo forced lengthways across mouth kept there with string going round back of head stood fothergill be bleeding from several cut in head percy heart gave bound of joy at finding that be not alone then tried to feel sorry that jack have not escaped failed to do so although told that comrade presence must not in way alleviate fate be certain to befall still thought of companionship even in wretchedness perhaps vague hope that jack with energy spirit might contrive way for escape cheered up a percy too be gagged word must be exchanged by midshipman nodded to other
