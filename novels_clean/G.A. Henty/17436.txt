last well know when boy fight at school in most case become better friend afterwards be not so here refused to shake hand with muttered something about being turn next time till then have not be considered first rate hand at anything be one of fellow who saunter through school get up just enough lesson to rub along comfortably never take prominent part in game have little set of own hold

well after fight changed altogether took to cricket in downright earnest be soon acknowledged to be best bat best bowler in school before that have be regarded a certain that when captain left must be elected when time came got majority of vote must not have minded that for recognised that be better player than fancied that have not done fairly for many fellow whom regarded a certain to support

there not only so soon showed so far superior to rest of that got remove to form above then there be competition in latin verse open to form latin verse be one thing in be strong there be sort of knack know in stringing together fellow may be duffer generally yet turn out latin verse better than fellow who be vastly superior to on other point be regarded a certain must gain that one have

action other must have got for be better rider than be at rate more reckless one be better shot too be incomparably more clever can not believe captain mallett be quite true bertha to add to be remarkably handsome fellow first rate talker when plea can make wonderfully popular must be perfect crichton captain mallett worst of be bertha although be ashamed of for thinking so have never be able to divest myself of idea that did not play fair there be two three queer thing happened at school in be always suspected of having have hand though be never proved be always convinced that used crib partly owed place to be jealous enough to believe that latin verse sent in be written for by rigby who be one of monitor great dab at verse rigby be great chum of for be mean fellow rival be

said anything about have be beaten there be use making row scandal over especially a have not shadow of proof against anyone be certain that be not so fast a be for during practice time have be a nearly a possible same a of man who beat with greatest ease be convinced that for once must have got better of have not be for foul play be shameful captain mallett bertha said indignantly wonder did not take step to expose have nothing to go upon bertha be case of suspicion only have idea what horrible row there must have be if have said anything about committee must have sat upon thing must have got into paper fellow must have taken side must have be blackguarded by one party for hinting that well known university man have be guilty of foul practice altogether must have be horrible nuisance be much better to keep quiet say nothing about be sure must not have done captain then see woman be much more impetuous than men be certain that after have once set ball rolling must have be sorry that have not bided time waited for contest in might have turned table fairly squarely must be hateful girl said be not considered hateful can assure conceived grudge against have taken immense pain to pay out only trust that path will never cross again if so have doubt that will again get worst of at rate see be not without justification when said that though did not believe in mal occhio have reason for having little superstition about prophesy captain mallett that if ever meet in future will turn table on man a can never win in long run well hope that prophecy will come true at rate will try hope that good wish will counterbalance power that will be sort of mascotte how tiresome girl broke off a there be movement among lady be time for to go up to dress for dinner though sha take time that of will do suppose must go captain mallett have six month previously succeeded at death of father to estate five mile from of sir john greendale elder brother have be killed in hunting field few month before frank mallett who be fond of profession have never looked for anything beyond save younger son portion have thus come in for very fine estate two month after father death most reluctantly sent in paper considering duty to settle down on estate ten day later came news of outbreak of sepoys of barrackpoor at once telegraphed to war office asking to be allowed to cancel application for leave to sell out so far cloud be very small one rumour of trouble have be current for little time affair at least gave excuse for delaying retirement very rapidly little cloud spread until overshadowed india from calcutta to afghan frontier regiment stood distance down on rota for indian service a news grew worse regiment after regiment be hurried off now stood very near head of list leave have not yet be stopped officer away be ordered to leave address so that must be summoned to join at hour notice when have left home that morning for day shooting with sir john have ordered horse to be kept saddled so that if telegram came must be brought to without moment delay be burning to be off there have at first be keen disappointment in regiment that be not likely to take part in fierce struggle feeling have changed into one of eager expectation when a contest widened be evident that must be necessary to make greatest effort to save india prospect of employment in work grew for last fortnight expectation have be at height order have be received for regiment to hold in readiness for embarkation men have be called back from furlough heavy baggage have be packed be ready for start at twenty four hour notice many of officer obtained few day leave to say goodbye to friend settle business matter frank mallett be among so suppose may go at moment mallett said host at dinner table that evening yes sir john shooting today have be execrable for have known that at moment fellow might ride up with order for to return at once be in fever of impatience that be surprised brought down bird at can hardly hope to be in time for siege of delhi for relief of lucknow mallett one must think not there be saying see news be month old havelock have be obliged to fall back on cawnpore perfect army of rebel be in delhi of course reinforcement will soon be arriving think likely that will get up there in time to share in affair even if be late for lucknow delhi there will be plenty for to do what with sepoy army with native chief have joined fighting men of oude one thing there can not be le than men in arm against even if do take delhi relieve lucknow be only beginning of work scoundrel be fighting with halter round neck have fear of missing share of work of winning back india punishing bloodthirsty scoundrel be terrible time sir john said old a be must like to be out there to lend hand in avenging awful business at cawnpore cold blooded massacre at other place think that there will be lack of volunteer sir john if government be to call for believe that men must be raised in week ay in twenty four hour there be scarce man in england must give five year of life to take share in punishment of faithless monster there be lack of national feeling in crimean war be a nothing to have be excited by massacre have be simple mutiny among troop must be well content to leave matter in hand of soldier be personal matter to everyone rich poor be alike moved by burning desire to take part in work of vengeance must doubt if country have ever be so stirred from earliest history yes fancy be envying mallett one of other gentleman said partridge shooting be tame work in comparison with be going on in india be lucky for that first mutiny took place when did for have be week later must probably have be gazetted out before news came yes be piece of luck certainly ashurst know how must be feeling if have be out of regiment on point of starting for india suppose be likely to embark from plymouth said sir john must think so there be saying hardly fancy that must go through france a of regiment have done there must be very great gain of time especially if start a far west a plymouth besides have not heard of transport being sent round to marseille lately of course in case will have to land at alexandria cross desert to suez must fancy now that advantage of route have be shown that troop in future will always be taken way see be only five week to india instead of five month situation be bad enough a be must have be infinitely worse if reinforcement must have got out from england in le than five month be there anything can do for while be

have got route said a entered leave evening have note from adjutant morning saying will be soon enough so see have time to come over say goodbye comfortably think goodbye be ever comfortable lady greendale said one may get through more comfortably than others be can be said for best of call hateful bertha put in downright hateful captain mallett especially when anyone be going away to fight be not pleasant admit frank mallett agreed ought to have said a comfortably a may be think perhaps who go feel le than who stay be excited about going have lot to think about to do idea that may not come back again scarcely occurs to at time although must admit possibility even probability if questioned however fancy worst of fighting will be over by time get there seems almost certain that will be so if delhi be captured lucknow relieved sepoys thought that have game entirely in hand that must sweep right out of india almost without resistance have failed when see day chance of success diminish resistance will grow fainter expect that will have many long march great many skirmish perhaps two three hard fight have not shadow of fear of single reverse be going out at best time of year with cool weather hard exercise there will be little danger of fever therefore chance be very strongly in favour of returning safe sound may take couple of year to stamp out at end of time hope to return here for good will find good deal more altered miss greendale than will find will have become dignified young lady will be only little older little browner see have never be stationed in india since joined for regiment have only just come home be looking forward with pleasurable anticipation to seeing ordinary life there in hot cantonment must be pretty dull though from what hear people enjoy much more than must think possible at time like present will be full of interest excitement will write to sometimes hope sir john said when mallett rose to leave wo promise to write often sir john expect that will be generally on move perhaps without tent of kind to write on one knee seated round bivouac fire with dozen fellow laughing talking round must be hopeless task if at time be halted at place where writing be possible will certainly do so have few friend in england at rate only men who never think of expecting letter a be among very oldest dearest friend will be pleasure for to let know how be getting on to be sure that will feel interest in doings there be warm goodbye went to door for few last word frank portmanteau be already in dog cart for have arranged to drive straight from greendale to chippenham where must dine at hotel then go on by mail to exeter be three o'clock when drove into barrack there early a hour be troop be already up busy wagon be being loaded long line of window be lighted up in room men must be seen moving about drove across barrack yard to own quarter left portmanteau there then walked to mess room a have expected found several officer there ah mallett there be be last in others turned up by evening train thought that a be comparatively near must come on by mail thought must find of fellow keeping up well there be nothing else to do there wo be much chance of going to sleep dined in town for of course mess plate kit have be packed up be not taking much with now just enough to make shift with rest will be sent round to calcutta to be stored there till settle down men have dinner given to by town a got leave out till twelve o'clock loading of wagon began at two there have be row going on night most of played pool till hour ago then gradually dropped off for hour snooze there will be chance of getting breakfast hope yes there be to be rough tumble breakfast at quarter to five fall in at quarter past got through inspection of kit yesterday mess sergeant party will pack up breakfast thing pot pan will come on by next train there be one at eight will be in plenty of time a suppose transport will be off until afternoon perhaps not till night there be always delay at last moment however will be something to be on board ship be first step towards getting at black scoundrel be afraid that will be late for delhi still there be plenty of other work to be done lady with there be general agreement among married officer that have best be left behind so for once regiment go without woman there be levity about tone that approve of armstrong frank mallett said reprovingly there be woman when went out to crimea at time when be good little boy doing latin exercise well altogether be good thing mallett will be much more comfortable without speak for armstrong lad of age who can talk nothing barrack slang be eminently uncomfortable when have to chat for five minute to lady be naturally glad when be free from restraint of having to talk like reasonable being be not so with older wiser men how about marwill have be away on leave for last ten day have not come back here there have be two fellow inquiring after diligently for last week there be mistaking errand even if did not know how stood expect be on board transport fancy colonel gave hint to join there doubt jew will be on lookout for at plymouth a well a here will manage to smuggle on board somehow even if have to wrap up a old woman deserves trouble have fallen upon frank mallett said angrily have patience with young fool who bet on race horse when know very well that if lose there be nothing for to do to go to jew for money however have have sharp lesson a be likely enough that regiment wo be back in england for year will have chance of getting straight again affair have be godsend for for have remained in england there must have be nothing for to do to sell out so chatted until mess waiter laid table for breakfast when other officer came pouring in meal be eaten hastily for assembly be sounding in barrack yard a soon a breakfast be finished officer went out took place with company there be brief inspection then drum fife set up girl left behind regiment marched off to station street being already full of people who have got up to see last of to wish godspeed in work of death be going to perform baggage be already in train be waiting for in station in few minute steamed away soldier hanging far out of window to wave last goodbye to weeping woman who thronged platform two hour later reached plymouth marched through town to dockyard went straight on board transport there be usual confusion until cabin have be allotted portmanteau stowed away general baggage lowered into hold tedious wait of three four hour followed one exactly knew why then paddle wheel began to revolve men burst into loud cheer few minute later passed drake island headed down sound have a expected found young marwill on board kept below until started although told that there be little chance of bailiff being permitted to enter dockyard a have grace to feel thoroughly ashamed of position little be said to manner of senior officer be sufficient to make feel strong disapproval of position in have placed by folly have taken solemn oath never to bet again said that evening to captain mallett who be general favourite with younger officer mean to keep how much do owe young 'un four hundred fifty what with allowance so on ought to be able to pay off in three four year yes if keep word marwill of may be inclined to help will for one must have done so before to give money to fool be worse than throwing into sea a soon a show by deed not word that really mean to keep straight will find that be not without friend thank awfully mallett want to be helped will clear off if live will find hard work to do marwill even in india of course pay allowance make easy for even subaltern to live on income there when come to laying by much be difficult matter however so long a actual campaign last necessary expense will be very small will live principally on ration can put by good bit there may be certain amount of prize money for although there be nothing to be got from mutineer of native prince who have joined will no doubt have to pay heavily for share in business well wo give up will mallett certainly not be a hard a anyone on before for have patience with such insane folly if keep straight one will be more inclined to make thing easy for voyage to alexandria be unmarked by incident drill went on regularly life differed to great extent from in barrack be glad when halfway stage of journey be reached still more so when embarked in transport at suez here learned according to news have arrived on previous day at end of august delhi be still holding out that although reinforcement have reached british vastly greater number of men have entered city constant sortie be made against british position on ridge excitement therefore be at highest when on th of october pilot came on board at mouth of hooghly learned that assault have be made on th of september that after desperate fighting extending over week city have be captured puppet emperor made prisoner rebel driven with tremendous loss across bridge of boat over jumma satisfaction with news be received in spite of disappointment that have arrived too late to share in victory be damped by news of heavy loss sustained in assault especially that of most gallant soldier general nicholson be hope that might take part in relief of lucknow realised for learned that on th of september place have be relieved by havelock outram here however there be still prospect that might take share in serious fighting a loss of relieving column have be so heavy force of mutineer so large that have be found impracticable to carry off garrison a intended relieving force be now besieged there be however fear felt for safety if scanty original garrison have defied effort of mutineer one doubted that now that force be trebled must succeed in defending until army sufficiently strong to bring off must be assembled not day be lost at calcutta general sir colin campbell who be now in supreme command be collecting force at cawnpore there have already be joined by column have be despatched from delhi a soon a capital fell by strong naval brigade with heavy gun from ship of war arrangement have be made for pushing up reinforcement a fast a arrived troop be marched from side of ship to spot where flotilla of boat be in readiness men only took what must carry other baggage be to be sent after by water to lie until further instruction at allahabad a soon therefore a troop have be packed away in boat be taken in tow by two steamer at once taken up river officer men be alike in highest spirit at finding in so short time after arrival already on way to front excitement be added to by fact that be still doubtful whether must arrive in time to join column cramped a men be in crowded boat there be murmuring a day after day night after night continued course up river at patna learned that commander in chief be still at cawnpore same welcome news be obtained at allahabad at latter place learned that news of having gone forward be hourly expected reached cawnpore on morning of th learned that column have left on th be halting at buntara not moment be lost man received six day provision from commissariat store two hour after landing regiment be on march arrived late at night at buntara being received with hearty cheer by troop assembled there learned that be to go forward on following morning weary in high spirit at finding that have arrived in time regiment lighted fire bivouacked have be close shave indeed mallett one of other captain said a party of sat round fire won by short head short indeed ackers have be race way from england be marvellous indeed that must arrive just in time to take part in relief of lucknow day later must have missed must not have done mallett for men must have marched night if necessary day tomorrow to catch up still be wonderful fluke that after must be in time there be doubt that will be tough business one of major said havelock found so expect that lesson taught have be lost that will have to meet greater difficulty than even have yes look at force sixteen gun of horse artillery heavy field battery naval brigade with eight gun th lancer punjaub cavalry hodson horse four british regiment of infantry two of punjaubies besides column strong be expected to join tomorrow next day hope in case major that sha follow line havelock took through narrow street for there can not use strength will manage to approach residency from other direction know that stand near river at very edge of town so there ought to be other way of getting at consider that be match for number of scoundrel if do get fair ground for fighting certainly must not do in street of town care how be so that do get at officer said have heard such frightful detail of atrocity a came up that one be burning to get at close quarter with suppose will go to alumbagh first relieve force have so long be shut up there only hope that sha be chosen to take place there be general exclamation of disgust at suggestion well someone must stay know went on in deprecation of epithet hurled at why not regiment a well a other because can not believe that after luck have favoured so long will play trick now frank mallett said besides other regiment have done something in way of fighting already while have not fired shot think that sir colin must be more likely to choose th in fact of other regiment than still if worst come to worst must not grumble other regiment have have weary time of waiting may be turn now suggestion have come a damper to spirit a mind acknowledging that be dog tired with march after not having used leg for last seven eight week will try to forget by going off to sleep making pillow of cloak lay down on spot where be sitting example being speedily followed by rest of officer next morning troop be on march early be not to reach alumbagh without opposition for on passing little fort to right be suddenly attacked by small body of rebel posted round little time be lost hodson horse who be nearest to at once made brilliant charge scattering in direction short pause be made while fort be dismantled then column proceeded without further interruption to alumbagh there be disappointment at appearance instead of finding a have expected palace there be nothing large garden enclosed by lofty wall having small mosque at one end have evidently be place of retirement when king of oude desired to get away from bustle ceremony of great town commander in chief be thoroughly acquainted with situation in city by information that have received from civilian named kavanagh who have at immense risk made way out from residency be able to furnish plan of principal building route in opinion of brigadier general inglis be most favourable for attack in evening reinforcement arrived bringing up total force to when order be issued officer of th found to intense satisfaction that a captain mallett have thought likely th be selected to remain in charge of baggage at alumbagh force moved off early on morning of th after marching short distance along direct road followed by havelock struck off to right keeping well away from city came down upon summer palace of king of oude called dilkoosha stood on eminence commanding view of whole of eastern suburb of town be surrounded by large park a soon a head of column approached heavy musketry fire broke out be at once evident that movement have be watched object of march divined head of column be halted for few minute until reinforcement came up then formed into line artillery opened on flank with cheer troop advanced to attack beggar can not shoot bit frank mallett said to subaltern armstrong expect be sepoys for oude tribesman be said to be good marksman keeping up rolling fire at loophole in wall infantry pressed forward fire of enemy slackened a approached soon forced way in helping comrade over wall others breaking down gate so pouring in halt be made until greater portion of troop came up then advance be continued defender of wall have be considerably reinforced by troop stationed round palace be unable to withstand british advance soon began to retreat towards city stopping occasionally where wall building offered facility for defence never waiting long enough for british to get at in two hour have be driven down hill to martiniere college here again made stand be speedily driven out chased through garden park of college thence across canal into street of town here pursuit ceased th being told off to hold martiniere a advanced position sir colin established headquarters at dilkoosha rest of troop bivouacking around on slope of hill between college after seeing that men be comfortable getting food most of officer gathered on flat roof of college whence fine view be obtainable over town residency have be already pointed out to british flag must be seen floating above several very large building surrounded for most part with walled garden rose above low roof of native house in intervening space way be pretty open good deal of ground seems to be occupied with garden most of house be so small that must not hold many men agree with mallett be evident that will be passing through open suburb rather than town big building if held in force will give good deal of trouble be regular fortress think that of be built of stone seem to be whitewashed be so major agreed a examined through field glass suppose stone be scarce in neighbourhood be probable that wall be of brickwork very thick will have to be regularly breached before can carry make one sad to think that flag have waved over residency for last five month defying effort of enormously superior number be to come down that scoundrel will be able to exult in possession of place have defied effort to take still one feel sir cohn decision be necessary one must never do to have six seven thousand men shut up there when there be urgent work to be done in score of other place besides must need vast magazine of provision to maintain force even when joined by garrison must be wholly inadequate for so tremendous task a reducing to submission city containing at least million inhabitant together with thirty forty thousand mutineer host of oude best men with advantage of possession of score two of building of be positive fortress there be nothing for to fall back again till have force sufficient to capture whole city utterly defeat defender with away place will become focus of mutiny fugitive from delhi will find way here at least will be able to crush at one blow instead of having to scour country for for month more of gather here better then when do capture place there will be end of

well off loss must not affect in way very likely will light upon rich booty in one of affair with rebel rajah will be able to pay off at once will if can mallett though think that will be much more

reported to be in possession of large village twenty mile away armstrong be laid up by slight attack of fever asked that marwill must be appointed in place on occasion one want two subaltern colonel

behaving excellently have gone far to retrieve character captain johnson have reported to that be exemplary in duty have shown much gallantry under fire especially in affair near neemuch in rushed forward carried off wounded man who must otherwise have certainly be killed reported case to brigadier who said that at other time young fellow must probably have be recommended for vc that there be so many case of individual gallantry that there be chance of getting that be specially mentioned in order four day ago will of course count in favour take with by mean ensign only joined with last

to point out to that be not going in seemed right direction column started at four o'clock in afternoon have be intended that must move off at daybreak on following morning frank have suggested to colonel that must be advantageous to march distance night of course must do twenty mile tomorrow colonel said men must hardly be in best fighting trim when got there moreover by starting in afternoon native here must imagine that be going to pounce upon fugitive at village not far away permission be readily granted accordingly after marching until nine o'clock in evening column halted in grove of tree to guide led mile from road man carried four day cooked provision in haversack there be therefore occasion for fire to be lighted after seeing that sentry be placed round edge of grove frank mallett joined officer who be gathered in centre what time will march tomorrow officer in command of native infantry asked not until heat of day be over have come about twelve mile have a much more to do if start at same hour a did today will get there about nine will halt mile away reconnoitre place at night if ground be open enough to move without making noise will post troop in position be to

surrounded while on fourth there be rough broken ground covered with scrub brush how far doe extend captain mallett asked guide about mile then join big jungle sahib be side will try to escape by therefore mr herbert will lead men round here with four scaling ladder will post along at foot of wall when hear explosion of powder bag outburst of musketry firing will scale wall advance to meet keeping a wide front a possible so a to prevent fugitive from passing getting out here cavalry will cut off who make across open country must give good deal to know how many of fellow be inside four hundred be number first reported may of course have already moved away on other hand may have be joined by others be said to have gun with will be of little use in street of village will probably capture before have time to fire single round at three o'clock troop stood to arm moved noiselessly off towards position assigned to captain mallett led own company to within four hundred yard of wall then sent marwill forward with two men to fix powder bag fuse to gate when have done be to remain quietly there until warned that company be about to advance then be to light fuse be cut to burn two minute to retire round angle of wall join company a came up troop lay down for ground be level there be spot behind must conceal impatiently watched sky until first gleam of light appeared ten minute elapsed dawn be spreading fast man be sent forward to lieutenant marwill to say that company be getting in motion a soon a messenger be seen to reach gate mallett gave word men sprang to foot double men will be there in time be use getting out of breath spoiling shooting be within hundred yard of gate when heard shout from village a pressed on shot after shot rang out from wall moment later there be heavy explosion a smoke cleared off gate be seen to be destroyed few second later troop burst through opening infantry bugle be sounding in village there be loud din of shouting cry of alarm order from house mutineer rushed musket in hand be shot down bayoneted by troop a latter approached large open space in middle of village strong body of sepoys advanced in good order to meet led by native officer steady men steady captain mallett shouted form across street quickly men fell in though several dropped a volley flashed out from sepoy line one volley then charge mallett shouted of gun be already empty rest poured in fire when word be given a regularly a if on parade level bayonet charge with loud cheer soldier sprang forward sepoys well commanded though be wavered broke british be upon before must fly with shout of cawnpore used bayonet with deadly effect driving enemy before a came into open fugitive cleared away on side saw long line of men drawn up moment later flash of fire ran along shoulder to shoulder men captain mallett shouted give bayonet with hoarse roar of rage for many of comrade have fallen company rushed forward burst through line of mutineer a if have be sheet of paper then divided captain mallett with company turned to right marwill took other wing to left encouraged by smallness of number of assailant mutineer cheered on by officer resisted stoutly scattering fire opened upon british from house round shout of mutineer rose louder louder when heavy volley be suddenly poured into punjaubies rushed out from street facing that by british have entered bore to right fell upon body with marwill be engaged sepoys taken wholly by surprise at once lost heart cheering loudly british attacked with increased ardour while punjaubies flung into midst in instant flank of sepoys be scattered in headlong flight hotly pursued by foe there be firing for musket be empty bayonet did work open space street leading from be thickly strewn with dead sepoys attacked by captain mallett party on other hand though shaken for moment stood firm led by two three native officer who fighting with greatest bravery exhorted men to continue resistance must rather be hung than fight shouted be handful be five to one against forward men exterminate feringhees before others can come back to assistance sepoys be now assailant with furious shout pressed round little body of british troop steady men steady captain mallett shouted a drove sword through body of one of rebel leader who rushed at keep together back to back will have help here in minute be longer than however before relief came for three four minute desperate struggle went on then marwill voice be heard shouting way men way moment later there be surging movement in rank of insurgent with dozen men marwill burst through joined party at once fell furiously upon mutineer latter be already giving way when fifty of punjaubies led by officer fell upon effect be decisive sepoys scattered at once fled in direction pursued by furious soldier punjaubies reaching wall fugitive leapt recklessly down forty fifty of be cut down by cavalry greater portion reached broken ground in safety here cavalry must not follow for ground be covered with rock boulder concealed by bush in village three hundred fifty lay dead thanks marwill frank mallett said when fight in village be over arrived just in time for be going very hard with altogether be more than bargained for for be certainly over thousand strong must have be joined by very strong party yesterday ought not to have gone so far marwill replied have idea that punjaubies have come to side of fight men be so eager have greatest difficulty in getting off pursuit fortunately met herbert learned that men be with then gathered dozen of fellow rushed off telling to follow a soon a must get of men together can imagine what agony felt when a entered open space saw surging mass of sepoys sign of of how cursed own folly what delight felt a on cutting way through found that be still on foot yes be close shave marwill two three minute must have be over men fought like lion a can see by piled up dead there half of be down twenty men can not hold out long against four five hundred owe life to beyond question see that be in least to blame in matter for naturally must suppose that of punjaubies must have joined besides be of course essential that must not give sepoys time to rally must follow up hotly where be anstruther know have not seen since entered square have of seen mr anstruther captain mallett asked turning to soldier standing near be lying over there sir one of men said be just in front of when pandies fired that volley at a came out of street pitched forward fell like stone think that be shot

sergeant take file of men go round count number of enemy who have fallen ah here come sowar will hear what cavalry have be doing outside trooper handed paper fifty three of enemy killed rest escaped into jungle on side two wounded one seriously one slightly be a well a must expect marwill of course most of got over wall at back see plan be disarranged by finding in such unexpected strength have be able to thrash by punjaubies must have cut off retreat in direction a be that part of business be failure sergeant presently returned there be in street sir reported reckon there be killed in house

neck about inch above collarbone ball have gone through muscle of neck beyond fact that wo be able to turn head for time will be none worse for inch further to right inch lower higher must have be fatal be not one of enemy who did service for ball went up from behind came out in front be evidently random shot from one of own fellow be always more afraid of shot from behind than be of one in front when be leading company doctor men get so excited that blaze away anyhow in smoke be just a likely to hit officer two three pace ahead of a enemy how long have be insensible be brought in here hour ago suppose that have lain many minute on ground before be picked up have taken imambarra yes what be better still fellow rushed into kaiser bagh at heel of enemy got news ten minute ago be good indeed anticipated desperate fighting before took that yes be unlucky shot mallett that knocked out of share in loot have always heard that place be full of treasure jewel if there be one else who want attention doctor advise to join regiment there for hour two a for care nothing about loot there be plenty of fellow who will benefit by more than must give up share willingly doctor shook head be afraid can not do between ourselves have let ferguson slip away be to divide what get with have wounded know yet whole thing be done so suddenly that loss can not have be heavy be in rear of brigade when be brought in a case at first looked bad got of stretcher men with to burst open door of house established dozen temporary bed here a see there be only four others tenanted be hopeless case doubt

marwill let slip through finger again that may be sure wo will send home to agent to sell have money put by for purchasing next step have have lesson will last for life well must be going now old man colonel did not like letting go a of course men want looking after pandies may make effort to drive out of kaiser bagh again so goodbye if can get away evening will come to see at hospital week later frank mallett be sitting in chair by bedside fighting be over strange quiet have succeeded long roar of battle neck be strapped up with bandage save that be unable to move head in slightest degree felt well enough to take place with regiment again many of fellow officer dropped in from time to time for short chat duty be heavy open resistance have ceased troop be engaged in searching house turning out rough character who have made lucknow centre have visible mean of subsistence large gang of lower class population be set to work to bury dead must otherwise have rendered city uninhabitable strong guard be posted at night alike to prevent soldier from wandering in search of loot to prevent fanatic from making sudden attack there be wounded man in hospital across road who want to see mallett surgeon said one morning belongs to company a only came out with last draft be transferred only on day that fighting began suppose know said be to tell name be george lechmere though enlisted a john hilton seem to know name doctor though remember at present where came across suppose can go in to see oh yes there be objection whatever wound be doing a well a can be though of course be still weak from loss of blood will send up afternoon to hospital just established in park of dil koosha will get out a soon a can for stench of town at present be dreadful wound can not be expected to do well in such poisoned atmosphere be man badly hit doctor very dangerously have scarcely hope of saving think probable that may not live twenty four hour of course may take change for better will take to have finished here now must have be bad time for doctor mallett said a went across tremendously hard most interesting have not have more than two hour sleep at time since fighting began till last night then must not keep up longer of course have be same with heat have made very trying be particularly anxious to get wounded well out of place for now that excitement be over expect outbreak of fever dysentery there be man in corner bed over there mallett went over to bedside looked at wounded man face be drawn pinched eye sunken in head face deadly pale hair matted with perspiration do know captain mallett lad can not say that do though when doctor told name seemed familiar to very likely must have recognised if have met week since see be altered good deal from effect of wound be son of farmer lechmere tenant good heaven man mean to say be lechmere eldest son george what in world brought to did man said sternly villainy brought here frank mallett gave start of astonishment that cost so violent twinge in wound that almost cried out with sudden pain what wild idea have got into head poor fellow said soothingly be conscious of having done wrong to yours saw father mother on afternoon before came away made complaint of anything be contented enough do know captain mallett loved martha bennett have be so little at home of recent year know very little of private affair of tenant remember of course be grieved to learn by letter from sir john greendale other day that in strange way be missing who knew that better than man said raising on elbow fixing look of such deadly hatred upon mallett that latter involuntarily drew back step saw laughing talking to in front of father house heard with in garden evening before left disappeared be voice heard in lane have known that be going that night must have followed killed saved next morning be gone waited time then went to depot of regiment enlisted have failed to save at least must avenge that bullet be mine have not stumbled over pandy body suppose just a pulled trigger must have be dead man did not know have failed rushing forward with company be in thickest of fight wanted to be killed shot struck at last when chasing pandy along passage in kaiser bagh turned levelled piece at mine be loaded must have shot down a turned stood let have shot when found here be sorry that have not finished at once when heard that be alive likely to recover thanked in heart that have left few more day of life must let know that be who have fired that martha wrong have not be wholly unavenged sank back exhausted on to pillow frank mallett have made attempt to interrupt sudden agony of wound astonishment at strange accusation have given so grave shock that leaned against wall behind in silent wonder hello mallett what deuce be matter with surgeon exclaimed a looking up from patient over whom be bending short distance away eye fell on officer face look a if be going to faint man here orderly brandy water quickly frank drank of brandy water sat down for few minute then when saw surgeon at other end of room got up went across to lechmere bed there be terrible mistake lechmere said quietly swear to on honour a gentleman that be altogether wrong from moment got into dog cart at bennett never saw martha again know nothing whatever of talk in garden did think saw a well a heard be on one side of high wall on other heard enough to know who be told that have to go abroad at once that if must come out there must put in charge of someone until must marry told that must not stay where be long knew what meant suppose be at calcutta still waiting for of course must not have come out with suppose that be breaking heart there now if be not dead a hope be did hear word calcutta india mentioned lechmere did not heard quite enough everyone knew that be going in day two be enough for after what have seen in afternoon saw nothing in afternoon captain mallett said angrily girl father mother be at home be chatting together until came out came to trap with while stood at open window be not more than minute before drove off have not spoken to girl dozen time since be little child why man if everyone took such insane fancy in head a do man must dare to speak to woman at however went on in altered voice be not time for anger be very ill lechmere doctor have not given up trust that will yet get round will be able to prove to own satisfaction that have happened to poor girl at least be wholly innocent of must not get over hurt must not like to go to grave believing have done great wrong speak to a to dying man having interest in deceiving swear to before heaven that know absolutely nothing of too may fall from rebel shot before long thank god can meet before a innocent man in matter must be going for see doctor coming to fetch goodbye lad may not meet again though trust will if not give full forgiveness for shot fired at be result of strange mistake have acted a believed must have well deserved death intended for confound mallett there seems end of mischief from visit here in first place be nearly knocked over now there be man lying insensible so for goodness ' sake get off to room again lie down keep quiet for rest of day will have demoralising whole ward if stay here captain mallett walked back with much feebler le steady step than with have entered hospital have doubt whether man who have made strange accusation have so nearly taken life be really sane whether have not altogether imagined conversation declared have heard in garden remembered now sudden way in george lechmere have turned round gone away when saw saying goodbye to martha how have shrugged shoulder in contempt man must either be mad of frightfully jealous disposition to conjure up harm out of such incident one who must do so might well when brain be on fire conjure up imaginary conversation still might have heard man talking to from what sir john have said did leave house go into garden about hour certainly never returned remembered about george lechmere now have reputation of being best judge of cattle in neighbourhood thoroughly steady fellow must see resemblance in shrunk wasted face to that remembered that evening officer men in hospital be carried away to new one outside town when doctor came in before be moved told mallett that man have seen have recovered from swoon be very nearly gone said managed to get round seems to that have be better since know what said to to want to know seems to have got something off mind be le feverish than be have really faint hope of pulling through especially a will now be in more healthful atmosphere be comfort indeed to wounded when late that evening lay on bed in hospital marquee air seemed deliciously cool fresh there be feeling of quiet restfulness be impossible in town with constant movement of troop sound of falling masonry dust fetid odour of decay week later surgeon told mallett that have now hope that

be in house unusual thing at time of day with former have said at breakfast to son must look after thing by today lad squire said yesterday that must come over sometime must not be out when came not for twenty pound note wife came to door when saw frank coming across field towards house well lechmere latter said when came up be glad to see dame looking so well hearty have not time to say more than word to yesterday wanted to have comfortable talk with wrote line telling how gallantly george have behaved how have saved life have to write day afterwards head be still ringing from sabre cut have for time knocked sense out of therefore have to cut very short how gallantly defended life against dozen of enemy cavalry be shown by fact that received victoria cross can tell that immense number of brave deed be performed during mutiny that george must be considered extraordinary act of bravery to have obtained for honour by time have entered farmhouse parlour george have not followed in on inquiring where be likely to find bob have gone off to join be proud to hear at time squire when be in paper george have got victoria cross neighbour came in to congratulate felt prouder still up to time when got letter did not know for sure where be have said meant to enlist from humour that be in when went away guessed to be in regiment where must get to war felt more glad a may guess from fact that missus have wronged in thought learnt that before got news be not until knew that have be wrong that of opened lip about though of knew what other thought know what mean lechmere told about well squire may be sure when knew that have wronged how wife fretted that did not know where to write to how to set about finding out where be so can guess how pleased be when heard from that be with regiment that have saved life at risk of own did not know then squire that if have have twenty life must have done right to have risked for told whole story yesterday just to mother bob ca tell yet squire what thought of know that will ever be able to tell will never cease to thank good lord for saving george from being murderer in madness murderer of own squire to bless major that must not only have forgiven kept crime from everyone must have taken in hand a say a if have never happened there be occasion for to have said anything about lechmere be undoubtedly more le mad at time upon whole think that affair have made better man up to time when saved life did duty a soldier well be most devoted servant to weight of business pressed heavily upon in spite of must say held aloof a much a possible from comrade after that changed altogether felt a told that god must not have given opportunity of saving life that have so nearly taken have not forgiven spirit rose while before certainly be not popular among comrade reserved man never be became general favourite officer of course showed good deal of interest in after what have done must have be sergeant in course of month refused corporal stripe when be offered to on day after battle saying that preferred remaining with though colonel told that after what have done must stand good chance of promotion after two three year service a sergeant told that knew jealous disposition have be sort of trouble to be sure that will never worry in way again believe that be now thoroughly master of that even man who wrought that foul wrong need not fear heard sir that poor girl came home died yes told when heard news from never said who did sir from other thing came out there be doubt who be told lechmere stopped short did not wish to know have suspicion did not want to have confirmed fellow suspect be friend of mine want to know anything about if be certain of must not meet without telling opinion of be not likely to meet here squire year ago happened to be over at chippenham one market day there be dozen of there can tell gave reception that mounted horse rode straight on again if have believe that must have horsewhipped through town three month afterwards estate be put up for sale have never be down in part of country since not that be ever here much before london suited better see mother be a have heard daughter of banker only child even if have have estate must have be rich man anyhow be heartily glad that have left county too be glad that have gone lechmere have not met for year if have be down here must have run against other sometimes after matter have passed between year ago must scarcely have met on friendly term however a there be nothing beyond mere suspicion against may in case be innocent see be suspected unjustly same thing may be case with be so squire though think that there be mistake time in fact believe told mother though kept from father for fear must break law at rate be good thing have gone for be hard landlord there be not good word for among tenant make probability of mistake more likely frank said if who a landlord a far a know have given ground for dislike to tenant be suspected unjustly must be still more likely to be case with one who be generally unpopular now how have farm be going on since be away just about a usual squire bob be not such good judge of horse cattle a george be in other respect think know more george did not care for reading bob be always at paper getting up last thing scientific chap have found out so matter be pretty well squared altogether have call to grumble ai likely squire to have to ask for time on rent day be worried sorely about george a long a matter hung over since be cleared up heard of having saved life have be happy again got big shock yesterday however when heard what have happened out there well be past over long ago have none of cause to regret have done george great deal of good a for might not be here now talking to if have not taken place for be memory of led george to desperate action saved life besides see have gained for attached faithful friend for be a friend rather than a servant regard son will always be that be sure squire told that have offered to set up on farm be quite right to say say that if have be with somebody else mother might not have felt rather sore that eldest boy must have taken to service of course be different with squire be only natural that lechmere must serve mallett seeing that father have be father tenant for hundred of year so that even if have not happened must not have minded a be be proud that be with seems natural that after wandering about world fighting with black villain out there must never be content to go on a be before to settle down to farming be like man like master in case mallett laughed after have once be over estate seen tenant learned that everyone be satisfied everything going on well will very soon begin to feel restless will be running off somewhere see have never be broken in to country life have idea of becoming absentee think month two together will be a much a can stand at rate a long a be bachelor be just what

taken yes there be lot of sea bird water bird only can not think of well look out laughed here be hunt yachting list bought on way here will leave with name that fix on will have only please choose one only two three boat not about same size have got lead to confusion if there be two craft going about of same name of about same size warn that will involve having to go down to poole to christen

to suit arrangement will try to come down major mallett if mamma will agree be long way to poole somehow one never seems to find hour to do anything so really can not promise well if can not manage miss greendale will have launched without being named bring round to southampton then must go down christen there must only be short railway run of couple of hour after breakfast say two hour for

other bertha laughed think be first time have ever heard express very strong opinion major mallett be quite refreshing to listen to thorough going denunciation of anything here in london in country of course be different sort of thing be heartily abused there especially perhaps weather free trade poaching people in whose cover fox be scarce here in london one seems to care much about anything people in set have time to do so that be very unkind think about amusement may think about be in very languid fashion now in country town when there be ball dance in neighbourhood be quite excitement at rate everyone enters into heartily people evidently enjoy dancing for dancing sake look a if be thoroughly enjoying whereas here people dance a if be rather painful duty than otherwise there be general expression of longing for whole thing to be over enjoy dancing bertha said sturdily at least when get really good partner yes then have only be three month at have not got broken into business

crowded lord mayor show training have not suited for must rather stand look on listen to scrap of conversation watch face of dancer of standing round be study think show one of worst side of nature be quite shocking to see hear envy uncharitableness boredom desperate effort to look cheerful under difficulty especially among girl get partner for shame be disappointed in bertha said half in jest half in earnest be not at person thought be may have fancied about never imagined cynic grumbler suppose brings out worst side of nature too laughed when come down on board osprey miss greendale will see

whether have flirtation in india flirtation repeated for once small section of womankind encountered be above beyond flirtation think went on seriously that in england can quite realise what be that woman in london society can imagine that there can exist state of thing in dress appearance be matter have altogether ceased to engross female mind white woman saw there be worn haggard matter what age bore on face impress of terrible hardship terrible danger terrible grief anxiety few have lost someone dear to many whom cared for few have made pitiful attempt at neatness most have lost thought of self care for personal appearance there be anxious look in eye be painful to witness spoke without thinking girl said gravely must have be awful awful a say be impossible for really to imagine quite what be to picture up such scene a must have witnessed can understand that must seem frivolous contemptible to go so far a that smiled be good that there must be butterfly a well a bee at rate woman of india who have reputation of being a frivolous pleasure loving a rest of sex came out nobly showed degree of patience under suffering of heroic courage unsurpassable in history be afraid said a hostess gave signal for lady to rise will long look back upon dinner a one of unprecedented dullness not dullness smiled exceptional certainly a something so different from usual thing when one talk of nothing opera theatre exhibition a to deserve to be put down in one diary by mark wo flatter by telling whether red black one who be party going to be mallett friend colonel severn said a stood together on deck of osprey early in august guaranteed that must be pleasant one when persuaded to leave london for first time since retired before shooting began well to begin with there be lady greendale eminently pleasant woman come a general chaperon will consider under especial care will not find hard work for be eminently sympathetic woman ready to chat if be disposed to talk to interest

must be anything like a good looking a be be always nice girl success so far have not spoiled then there be miss sinclair great friend of bertha jack hawley of guard knew out in crimea other two be wilson who be clever young barrister particularly pleasant fellow wife who be sister of miss sinclair so think there be element of pleasant party lady be broken into smoke for sir john smoked so doe wilson so that wo be expected to go forward a do on p o whenever want to enjoy favourite pipe be comfort anyhow mallett if there be one thing in world hate be having to go hunt about for place to smoke in never accept invitation to shooting party unless know beforehand that smoking be allowed at what time do expect others will be down at half past twelve be coming by same train be because knew that must want to be in smoking carriage told to come down by earlier one besides thought well to get here first be only stranger a be others be intimate with other be a well to post a to various relationship one thing mallett hope lady greendale be not in way marrying woman be not like mr pickwick afraid of widow have perfect confidence in power to resist temptation at same time make difference in world to one comfort be not as enough to suppose that lady greendale must even dream for moment of setting cap at colonel on half pay if woman be in marrying line always expects certain amount of what may call delicate attention be daily bread for considers that unless man come across evinces certain amount of admiration be sign that charm be on wane chance growing more more remote mallett laughed can set mind at ease for nothing be further from thought of lady greendale than re marriage be very happy with husband more reason for marrying again colonel said woman who have be happy with husband be apt to get idea into head that man will make good husband confoundedly mistaken idea be be much more likely to marry again than woman who have have hard time of well may be right there colonel putting aside conviction that lady greendale have idea of marrying again be fact that at present thought be occupied by daughter be not at what must call managing mother be sure that have set heart on bertha making good match that fear that will succumb to penniless younger son other unsuitable partner be at present dominant feeling in mind think must have agreed to jack hawley being of party have not bertha entertained conviction that be rather gone on miss sinclair who by way have like sister money enough to disregard fact that jack be hardly in respect well endowed however be time for to be off see skipper be getting gig lowered suppose will be content to sit here smoke pipe until come back indeed seven be a many a gig will carry with degree of comfort cutter will go ashore to fetch off luggage will probably be of somewhat portentous dimension two minute later mallett took place in gig be rowed to shore be delighted with new purchase be excellent sea boat a have learned from short spin with craft decidedly fast have not however entered for race there be hurry said to skipper when latter suggested that must try at cowes must like to win first race in first place know that be in best trim in next place must get crew accustomed to other to craft bought a cruiser rather than racer want to have full of men a be most of racer be heavy expense fewer hand accustomed to work well together do just a much work more smartly than crowd found when sailed round island with royal victoria race that considering went under reduced canvas held own very fairly have doubt that when get light canvas up osprey will give good account of gear be scarcely stretched yet will wait until next season then will make bold bid for queen cup frank mallett reached platform at southampton few minute before train came in party be on lookout for alighted in highest spirit now lady said first thing be to point out luggage man here will get together stand guard over till two others arrive to get on board will be here in few minute in fact ought to be here now looked on with something like dismay while box be picked out piled together dear lady greendale said be afraid must have very vague idea a to amount of accommodation in ton yacht be not cunarder p o why two three of trunk must absolutely fill one of cabin did not expect major mallett bertha said demurely that be coming for month cruise with only handbag especially after telling very likely might not get chance of getting washing done time well dare say will stow away somewhere now a have got together will go down to boat now lad have better get hand cart get thing on board a soon a can be osprey amy sinclair asked bertha a took place in boat bertha looked with rather puzzled face at fleet of yacht be said confidently after moment hesitation pointing to one towards boat be at moment heading frank mallett laughed really must have thought miss greendale that although making allowance for feminine vagueness a to boat must have known yacht christened month ago at rate must not have mistaken schooner for yawl after patient explanation gave on last visit a to different rig be osprey hundred yard lower down oh yes remember now that when there be little mast standing on stern be yawl thing seem very simple to major mallett be very puzzling to woman who know nothing about now venture to say that if be to show six different material for frock be to tell name must know nothing about when showed to month afterwards suppose gentleman on board be colonel severn yes came down by train before yours thought better that must do so a in first place did not know of in next a see be pretty closely packed a be what be flag at masthead lady greendale asked bertha said that flag be going to have eagle on be on racing flag let impress upon lady that racing flag be square flag that be not flag at burgee club have burgee a see be white cross on blue ground with crown in centre be burgee of royal thames of be elected member last month here be properly ought to be on board first be too wedged in wilson have better go up first will give more room for lady to move have got new step bertha said when came down with mr wilson to christen boat have to climb up nasty steep step against side be great deal more comfortable be thinking that mamma must have difficulty in getting up other thing if be at rough yes have have specially made for present occasion large cruiser always have at rate be more comfortable for sized boat take up rather more room to stow away be really not so handy in sea for boat can not get so close alongside still doubt be more comfortable for lady now be turn cruise of osprey be in respect success party be well chosen pleasant colonel severn lady greendale got on well together liked because have objection to perpetual enjoyment of pipe liked because be altogether different from anyone that have met before indian story amused view of life be original grumbling at modern way modern innovation in way concealed fact that in spite of evidently enjoyed life thoroughly osprey have fine weather a ran along south coast anchoring under portland for day while party examined work of breakwater paid visit to quarry where convict be at work put into torquay dartmouth plymouth spending day in two former port two at last named looked into fowey stopped two day at falmouth then rounding land end made for kingstown from here started for clyde meeting with very heavy weather went into belfast lough osprey proved to be fine sea boat behaved so well that even lady greendale declared must not be afraid to trust on board in weather sailed up clyde a far a greenock then returning cruised for fortnight among island on west coast have enjoyed stay at kingstown so much that put in there again on return voyage shaped course for plymouth then without looking into other port returned to southampton jack hawley miss sinclair have become engaged during voyage colonel lady greendale have become so confidential that frank laughingly asked if have changed view on subject of matrimony suggestion indignantly repudiated must have thought that knew better said reproachfully admit that lady greendale be very charming woman think that can imagine for moment have ever entertained idea of such thing said be to amuse if must have tried best to keep old lady a much to myself a possible so a to enable young people to carry out flirtation to heart content by gad sir must be nice return for following out instruction to find in hole a frank have difficulty in persuading colonel that remark be not meant a serious one that there be fear whatever that lady greendale have ever have slightest reason to suppose that intention be not of most platonic nature be heartily glad colonel said when be quite pacified that hawley affair have come off right even if have not be heiress must have said that be lucky fellow for be extremely nice pleasant young woman without nonsense about still there be doubt that fortune will come in very handy for hawley a to girl think have made very good choice have plenty of money for a have managed to keep up on younger son portion can have extravagant taste will make very good husband there be other engagement to be announced suppose a be only other unmarried man on board colonel question be somewhat pointed hope there may be one of day think that must be fair to ask here where be host be under glamour of sea doubt whether have slightest idea of what want be worst of being very old friend relation get so fixed that woman doe not recognise that can ever be changed however will try luck one of day think that will meet with serious opposition on mother part if bertha like know that lady greendale have very much more ambitious view for have quite set mind upon making good match doubt have right to expect that will do so however think be too fond of bertha to thwart however disappointed might feel at present think that have more suspicion than bertha herself of intention during voyage bertha amy sinclair have become quite adroit helmswomen one other be constantly at tiller when wind be light bertha have learned name of crew often went forward to ask question of men tending head sail becoming prime favourite with hand on arriving at rest of party went up at once to town while frank remained behind for day two going round in yacht to gosport where be to be laid up for winter chapter be so sorry bertha greendale said so awfully sorry have idea that thought of like be such friend so long ago have be so pleasant since came home last year like a if be big brother have never thought of in other light now seems dreadful to to give pain feel sure must never come to love in way burst into tear think anything more about dear frank mallett said gently have felt sometimes when have be together that be so kindly frank pleasant with that must feel a wanted to ought to have known always suppose in such case man deceives shuts eye to fact have certainly nothing to blame about of course be hard blow doubt will get over a other fellow do at rate know that will always be dear friend need not fear that will mope over misfortune will run up to town for bit a be going up for season next week will doubt often meet fret about have be hit pretty hard several time though not in same way have always gone through doubt will do so now goodbye when bertha looked up have left room oh mamma said when went into room where mother be sitting be so sorry so dreadfully sorry frank mallett have asked to be wife have never thought of such thing of course have to say have thought thing likely for time bertha thought best to hold tongue about in such matter interference of mother often doe more harm than good felt sure by manner with that have idea of must say that much a like frank mallett must have be sorry have great hope of making really first class match must not make better match bertha said indignantly one must be kinder nicer than major mallett know how brave be how have distinguished have good estate everything that anyone must wish only unfortunately love at least not in way have never shown what must consider particular attention never talked to in way men do when be making love to girl nothing must be nicer be nicer because never thought of suppose be because be so different from of men met in town last season who always seemed to be trying to get round know be not nice expression mamma know what mean know dear mother smiled of course be very good match though want to flatter be one of belle of season though of men speak of be by mean desirable younger son barrister sort of thing still there be two three whom girl might have be pleased to see at foot who be sure from what saw only needed little encouragement from to be there be little vexed dear see that did not give of encouragement understand of course that novelty of first season carried away altogether that liked dancing fete opera for not because brought in contact with men of excellent class so far a must see be matter of indifference to whether man be peer with splendid rent roll younger son without farthing so that be good dancer pleasant companion of course after season two will grow wiser do hope not mamma bertha said indignantly mean to say that might not be better to marry a say peer with good rent roll than younger son without penny other thing being equal be to say if one liked equally hope that will never come to like anyone bit more for being peer lady greendale smiled indulgently be natural sentiment dear for girl of age inexperience in time will come to see thing in different light then changed subject what be frank going to do be fortunate that be going up to town next week be going up to town tomorrow be sure that will never hear from from anyone else what have happened will meet in town a usual be sure that will be just same a be before that will be great deal more uncomfortable than will be very silly affair altogether think must give anything if have not happened lady greendale did not echo sentiment liked frank mallett immensely have always be great favourite of hers since have guessed what bertha have not dreamed of have be uncomfortable threatened to disturb plan have formed be well contented to learn that have refused lady greendale be thoroughly kind hearted woman must not forget that might have made in worldly sense better match than have ambition have since bertha be child still more since have shown promise of exceptional good look be centred on making really good match frank went up to town next day greendales followed week later did not often meet in society a frank seldom went out called occasionally in old friendly unceremonious way must have required acute observer to see difference in manner to bertha lady greendale noticed girl felt that although be le kind friendly there be impalpable change in manner something that felt though must not define even to have have tiff with major mallett bertha mr wilson asked one day when be alone with in drawing room frank have just left after spending hour there tiff carrie put idea into head eye assisted perhaps by ear dear do think that after being with on yacht last autumn must not notice change in manner to other have expected before now to have heard interesting piece of news now see that thing have gone wrong somehow be just a good friend a always be bertha said shortly bit mean to say that have refused bertha mean to say anything of sort simply say that major mallett have always be great friend be so now there be one have higher regard for well bertha want to know secret if wish to tell can say be that if have refused have done very foolish thing know man that woman might be happier with when be out last year with amy agreed that be certain to come off thought how well suited be to other of course in worldly respect might do better just at present have ball at foot choose where may will not find finer fellow than be yes told harry that be lucky that have not made that trip on board osprey before be irrevocably captured for must certainly have lost heart to major mallett well be sorry bertha more sorry than can say be sure that amy will be too said nothing whatever carrie must justify little explosion certainly intend to answer must really feel very vexed if be not perfectly sure that must never tell anyone else of notion that have got in head may be quite sure of bertha at least when say one else of course include harry know well enough to be certain that will not go further be sure will be a disappointed a be in fact will have small triumph over for after usual manner of men saw nothing on board yacht have always maintained that be pure fancy on part however wo tell anyone else not even amy can find out for may be sure will do when come back from continent if indeed own happiness with jack have not blinded to sub lunary matter well goodbye dear will forgive saying that be disappointed in terribly disappointed in must try to put up with carrie be not aware that consulted before made own matrimonial arrangement perhaps may be able to manage own '' well be cross bertha remember that be not advising counselling be simply regretting perhaps may do day other with parting shot left week went on when may came frank told that osprey be fitted out that must join in day two bertha heard news with satisfaction season be gay one be enjoying greatly one little drop of bitterness in cup being that must no longer enjoy visit a formerly did have be one man with whom be able to talk laugh quite freely who be really old friend link not only between past between country life now thought pettishly have spoiled what annoyed almost a much be that change be more in than in no longer gave commission to execute for made general confidant knew that must be a ready a before to laugh to sympathise that must still gladly execute commission felt that tried hard to make forget that have aspired to be something nearer to than brotherly friend felt that after what have said must never stand in quite same relation a before accustomed a frank be to read thought be not deceived by expression of regret that must now see little of a saw news be really pleasant to be not aware that be conversation that have have evening before with colonel severn have decided to go down to osprey fortnight earlier than have intended be getting to be almost a regular attendant here mallett a be think be altogether too young to take regularly to club life be very well for old fogey like think good thing for young fellow like to take so early to bachelor life want to do anything of sort colonel ca stand crush in hot room can not for life of see where pleasure come in begin to think be as to leave army not at lad not at when man have got good estate be much better for to settle down upon to marry have child sort of thing than be to remain in army in time of peace have wilson hawley dining with here yesterday have great chat over pleasant time have last year on board yacht know when enjoyed so much a did then lady greendale be remarkably clever woman daughter be a nice girl a have come across for long time without scrap of nonsense about wonder that have not become engaged

came back say have be very lucky on turf have made pot of money so have heard frank said see one generally hears of men good luck not of bad besides many men do most of real betting through commissioner especially if own horse be fellow much care for hope that whomever miss greendale may marry will not be man thought when first asked down last year that have got up party specially for mallett that be going in for prize of course soon saw be mistaken a be altogether too good chum for to come about have often noticed that men girl who be thrown lot together be often capital friend

must win in canter a be only beat carthew horse by short head have carthew backed horse to win told that have only backed for hundred have put five hundred on for place a got six to one against came uncommonly well out of do think likely that miss greendale will accept ah can not say have certainly be making very strong running if be betting man must not mind laying two to one on event coming off frank joined osprey be lying off portsmouth harbour on following day be back earlier than expected george said a lechmere met at station have got tired of london want to be on board again nothing gone wrong in town hope major george said next day a be removing breakfast thing will excuse asking seem to to be since came on board well yes george be upset confess be sure will be sorry too when tell that be more than probable that miss greendale be going to marry mr carthew george put dish be holding down on table with crash stood gazing at frank in blank dismay why sir thought said slowly that be going to be miss greendale have always thought so excuse sir mean offence be what have thought ever since came down to christen yacht there be offence george yes mind telling have hoped so be not to be see miss greendale have known since be child have never thought of in other way than a sort of cousin someone liked very much have never thought of for moment a one must marry be past gone must be sorry most sorry for to marry carthew knowing what do of must not be sir george said vehemently can never let that sweet young lady marry black hearted villain unfortunately can not prevent george why sir must only have to tell about martha be sure must do for business miss greendale can know nothing about so far a can remember be not more than sixteen at time suppose lady greendale ever heard of knew of course of martha being missing because made quite stir suppose that heard of coming back be only at home three week before died there be not many that ever saw father told that others made so hot for carthew one day at chippenham market that never came down again sold place soon after suppose gentry ever heard anything about if have lady greendale must surely never let daughter marry feel sure must not still george see that can possibly interfere in matter story be three year old now even if have only happened yesterday after what have occurred between must not come forward a accuser must have appearance of spite on side besides have proof whatever must of course deny whole thing mean that must deny that said so must not do might declare that have spoken falsely might even say that be attempt to put sin on shoulder moreover a told have other reason for disliking man on face of must seem have raked up old story against not only from jealousy from personal malice be out of question must interfere must give everything that be worth to be able to do so be impossible if have full unquestionable proof must go to lady greendale lay matter before have such proof there be nothing except poor girl word against george lip closed expression of grim determination came over face dare say be right major said after pause seems to hard that miss greendale must be sacrificed to man like frank did not reply have already thought matter over over again have reached opinion that must not interfere if have not proposed to be refused might have moved up to time have stood in position of old friend of family a such must well have spoken to lady greendale on matter so vitally concerned bertha happiness now taking that step must have appearance of being interference of disappointed rival rather than of disinterested friend went up on deck sat there for time at last arrived at conclusion be duty there can be doubt about that said to if bertha really love carthew will believe denial rather than accusation unsupported a be by scrap of real evidence in case will put down story a piece of malice meanness after will matter little have better far lose liking esteem than own self respect will tell lady greendale about responsibility will be off hand then may not view matter a absolute bar to carthew marrying bertha be business bertha at rate will have done duty will wait however until bertha have accepted have made up mind george said later on if hear that miss greendale have accepted carthew will go to mother tell story have little hope that will do much good be very hard to make girl believe anything against man love until can be proved beyond doubt a carthew will of course indignantly deny that have anything to do with expect that will have effect beyond making dislike cordially still that can not be helped be clearly duty not only a friend a friend of father mother wish that task did not fall upon be glad to hear say that major george said quietly can see sir that a say must be better if anyone else must do lady greendale have known for so many year that must surely know that must never have told unless believed story to be true doubt will george hope miss greendale will too even if doe not see in light can not help well will go ashore to clubhouse find out whether have heard anything about entry for cup when returned said to captain hear that phantom have entered hawkins be told that have just come off slip that have have new suit of racing canvas made by lapthorne well sir think that ought to have good chance with have shown very fast boat few time have be raced so have taking line through boat that have sailed against think that ought to be able to beat have rather fancy that sha do so hawkins will do best have met mr carthew good many time for be at school college together somehow other have always managed to beat ah well will turn table on time sir hope so have gone so often other way have got to be little superstitious about must give good deal to beat must like to win queen cup a know even if did win must be quite satisfied if beat chapter be week of ryde regatta at time ryde disputed with cowes glory

favourite of hers suppose have brought up message from major mallett miss greendale major doe not know have come to be on own account be here must spare quarter of hour certainly george said in surprise will come out into garden be likely to have to ourselves at hour fetched hat went out into garden together george did not attempt to speak until reached other end where there be seat in shady corner sit down george said thank miss greendale must rather stand took place in front of have story to tell said be very painful for to have to tell will be painful for to hear be sure that ought to know bertha did not say anything looked at with eye wide open with surprise be sure miss greendale george went on that major never told that bad wound received at delhi that killed be doing that be wounded by ball from musket george certainly never said so suppose be in front of musket went off accidentally miss greendale took deliberate aim at be only mercy of god saved life bertha be too surprised shocked to speak went on thought that have be hit by sepoy bullet be only when sent for believing that have received death wound that knew that be who have hit for what asked what made do terrible thing thought be liked by men there be one liked better miss greendale be most popular officer in regiment if soldier have known have escaped being hung for must have be first time went into action afterwards have nothing to do with army enlisted in company on purpose to shoot bertha must hardly believe ear looked at man earnestly surely must not have be drinking at time of morning must

be at one time engaged to martha be of jealous passionate disposition did not make enough allowance for being young naturally fond of admiration quarrelled with engagement be broken off still loved with heart soul then went on to tell of how maddened have be when have seen talking to major mallett of conversation have overheard in father garden on evening before be missing jumped at conclusion at once miss greendale that be captain mallett a be then have be round saying goodbye to tenant afternoon knew that be going abroad what must suppose that have ruined poor girl have persuaded to go out to join in india waited for time while searched for body knew must never find own father mother in heart thought that have murdered in fit of jealous rage at last made up mind to enlist in regiment to follow to india kill find bring home how dreadful girl murmured be dreadful miss greendale believe now that must have be mad at time however did at end failed mercifully be saved from being murderer a told be badly wounded thought be going to die doctor thought so too so sent for captain mallett might have satisfaction of letting know that be who fired shot that be in revenge for wrong that have done martha when told saw by face even before spoke that have be wrong knew nothing whatever of well miss forgave forgave wholly told that must never mention to soul a have never mentioned even to may see how well have kept word wanted to leave regiment felt must never mix with comrade knowing a did that have tried to murder favourite officer major must not hear of insisted must stay even more promised that a soon a be out of hospital must be servant saying that a son of old tenant must rather have than anyone else can well imagine then miss greendale how willingly must

minute then said in low tone thank george have done right in telling story be one ought to know wonder stopped wonder that major did not tell miss greendale asked when think over will understand why must not tell for have actual proof save dying girl word what have seen heard motive in telling might have be misunderstood told that even at risk of that must feel duty if became engaged to villain to tell story to lady greendale if found hard to speak there seemed to reason why must except father mother one know be well nigh murderer though have so generously forgiven have in small way tried to show gratitude to be still painful to to have to tell story to anyone else felt ought to do not for sake because have told that what have looked for what have so hoped for be not to be because thought that ought not to be allowed to sacrifice life to man partly too because wished to spare dear master pain of telling story of perhaps being misunderstood thank george said quietly have done quite right in telling at moment voice be heard at other end of garden will be going at once george said seizing opportunity of getting away turning walked down garden left house who be friend bertha miss

daughter claim almost proprietary interest in osprey because latter be godmother indeed be naturally interested in too a being one of crack be very smart looking craft though think be pity that be not cutter rigged must look prettier doubt frank said see though be built a racer like race occasionally be not primary object wanted for cruising there be doubt that yawl be more handy can work with fewer hand than can cutter of same size went round vessel then returning on deck sat down chatted while waiting for boat return sincerely hope that will win frank on friday lady greendale said sympathy be rather divided hope osprey will win thank lady greendale be by mean sanguine about fancy miss haverley that miss greendale will see winning flag flying overhead when race be over why do think so major lord haverley asked general opinion be that record be better than of phantom have done well in two three race have sailed certainly did not beat lesbia mermaid by a much a did may be frank agreed regard carthew a having be born under lucky star though own opinion be that if phantom be in other hand must beat fancy luck will pull through haverley laughed must not have given credit for being superstitious major think have many superstition own to something like in case bertha looked earnestly at just before gig returned from shore frank be standing together be sorry will not have good wish tomorrow said have not said that anyone will have good wish replied will be on board phantom because be invited there before asked hope be that best yacht will win want to speak to for minute two when can see can come up tomorrow morning early replied what time will best suit ten o'clock please ask for mamma next morning lady greendale bertha came together into sitting room into

have time to come in tomorrow morning for know start at nine thought must drop in morning even if hour be early one after chatting for few minute lady greendale made excuse to leave room knew that be coming wanted to speak to said bertha well what be anything of importance asked with smile hesitated then went on word spoke yesterday recalled to something said nearly four year ago do remember when sat next to other in twilight day before went to india be talking about superstition then told that have only one said what be remember remember said gravely about someone who have beaten always who thought always must beat if came in contact again must not tell name be mr carthew must not answer question then bertha surely can not expect to answer now do expect to answer then must most emphatically decline to do so said what do think that if be must be so base a to discredit now for must remember that said that only one of defeat be due to foul play that most of others be simply due to fact that be better man than be matter have long since be forgotten whoever be must not prejudice in opinion of anyone by raising up that old story have shadow of proof that be who damaged boat might have be act of boatman about place who have laid money against winning be enough said quietly did not think that must tell whether be mr carthew be sure that if be not must not hesitate to say so thank be wanted to see for what said yesterday brought that talk have so vividly into mind must not resist asking explained what seemed to at time to be strange how be that who be generally so cordial in manner be so cold to when first met at house thought that there might be something more serious looked full in face perhaps be prejudiced beggar said with attempt to smile then added somewhat bitterly see thing since have not be calculated to make specially generous in case did not reply after moment pause said well a lady greendale seems to be busy will be going will come to ball tomorrow evening wo asked suppose will have to said if win though mind feel sure that sha will seem odd if come if lose will look a if sulked must come said must have dance with have not be keeping word major mallett said that must always be same to be not have never once asked to dance with be changed altogether try to be try hard bertha just at present be beyond can not stand by see going stopped abruptly well never mind bertha will come right in time at rate can not stand at present goodbye without giving time to reply hastily left room bertha stood silent for minute two then quietly followed out of room next day ryde be astir early be queen cup day eight yacht be entered three schooner rhodope isobel mayflower four cutter pearl chrysalis alacrity phantom osprey be only yawl be half past eight be under way under mainsail jib solent be alive with yacht be pouring out from southampton water be coming up from cowes be making way across from portsmouth day be fine one for sailing have got same extra hand a last time frank asked skipper same sir know work well of course if there be anything to be done aloft own men go up think of will beat in smartness a time approached for start racer began to gather in neighbourhood of starting line a five minute gun fired topsail went up began to sail backwards forward near a phantom crossed under lee of osprey three lady waved handkerchief to frank who took off cap may best yacht win bertha called out a vessel flew quickly apart must not want better day george frank said can carry everything comfortably there be not enough wind to kick up much of sea a far a be concerned must rather that wind have be either north south so that must have laid course round a be will have wind almost dead aft till be round nab then will be close hauled with perhaps occasional tack along back of island then free again back there be doubt that cutter have pull close hauled fancy with wind schooner will be out of though if have be reach whole way must have have good chance four minute be gone be holding watch in hand after short pause called out five second gone osprey have good position at present though with wind aft be of comparatively little consequence be nearly in line with mark boat nearest to shore hundred fifty yard from haul in main sheet hawkins said quietly men stationed there hauled on rope until said that will do must not go too fast went on turning to frank who have just called out twenty second gone think that will about do latter nodded bit more lad skipper said ten second later will do fifteen second more frank said presently slack away sheet slack away handsomely up foresail be shouted skipper a boom ran out foresail went up osprey glided on with accelerated speed end of bowsprit be few yard from starting line when gun fired bravo good start frank said a looked round for first time eight yacht be within length of other cheer broke from boat around a sped on way for time there be little difference between then cutter began to show little in front long boom gave advantage over schooner yawl when before wind spinnaker be not then invented wind be not sufficiently dead aft to enable schooner to carry mainsail foresail wing wing for yawl mizzen to help a passed sea view cutter be length ahead phantom having slight advantage over sister gained further for schooner fell into wake a soon a be able to do so thus robbing of of wind osprey having inside station kept straight on came up with cutter a be abreast of end of island be travelling very fast through water will be first round nab sir hawkins said in delight schooner be smothering cutter be not hurting give plenty of room when get there frank said skipper nodded wo risk foul sir may be sure three lady on board phantom be seated on footstool under weather bulwark although a yet yacht be travelling on almost even keel miss haverley lady olive uttered exclamation of satisfaction a phantom slowly drew ahead of others be loud in disgust a saw effect of schooner sail behind on own speed call fair former said if vessel can not sail well that must be allowed to damage chance of others do bertha know suppose be equally fair for that must do same if boat have got ahead of still be very tiresome be just a bad for other cutter look at osprey lady olive said soon afterwards be coming up fast see have nothing behind do believe that be going to pas wo make much difference carthew who be standing close to said confidently race wo really begin until be round nab after sha hamper other be quite content with way that be going osprey rounded lightship two length ahead phantom came next three length before chrysalis others followed in quick succession sheet be hauled in yacht be able to lie close hauled for ventnor three leading boat maintained respective place drew out from other when passed ventnor osprey be five length ahead of phantom be downcast lady carthew said gaily have long way to go yet once round point will have to turn till pas needle sea be now getting good deal rougher wind be against tide yacht began to throw spray over bow bertha be struck with confidence with carthew have spoken watched closely will get good deal worse off st catherine head went on there be race there even in calmest weather must advise to get wrap ready for spray will be flying over when get into be now working tack tack osprey be still improving position a neared st catherine head be good quarter of mile to good still carthew maintained good temper bertha must see that be with effort seemed to pay little attention to sailing of phantom kept eye intently fixed upon osprey must not be surprised at of carrying away spar before long said wind be freshening will have to shift topsail jib fancy be now lying far over water be two three plank up lee deck time cutter went about lady carried footstool up to windward when vessel be for moment on even keel when there be obliged to sit with one hand over rail to prevent from sliding down to leeward a vessel heeled there go chrysalis topmast skipper exclaimed suddenly that doe for chance think have better get jib header ready for hoisting mr carthew spar be bending like whip yes think have better get up at once captain be use running risk a phantom big topsail came down osprey be seen to flutter then to descend have only be waiting for captain said carthew made reply be still intently watching craft ahead be just a well for captain went on will be in race directly bertha be still watching carthew face cheerful a tone be there be expression of anxiety in three minute later gave exclamation a of relief shout rose from men forward following direction of eye saw bowsprit of osprey swing to leeward moment later topmast fall over side what did tell carthew said exultingly race be never lost till be won oh be sorry bertha said do think be hard to lose race by accident yacht have to abide by own accident miss greendale carrying away spar be one of accident one count on if be not for risk yacht must always carry on too long be matter of judgment of attention to gear loss of spar be in nine time out of ten result of rashness of inattention however be sorry be to say must prefer winning cup by arriving first at flag boat however be certainly not disposed to grumble at fortune just at present must think not mr carthew lady olive said be sure congratulate very heartily of course have seen score of race whenever there be wind someone be always sure to lose spar sometimes two three will do so think need fear of boat behind yet feel quite safe have fear of of cutter once round needle will be broad reach will see that schooner will come up fast have to allow good bit of time however think be pretty safe chapter phantom presently came along close to osprey carthew shouted be there anything can do for thank frank replied then bertha called out be so sorry frank waved hand in reply men be busy trying to get wreckage alongside cross tree have be carried away by fall of topmast deck forward be littered with gear difficulty be greatly increased by heavy sea in race a soon a have got everything on board hawkins will put couple of reef in mainsail will go well enough under foresail if mizzen be too much for can take off be nearly hour before be clear last of yacht in race have passed before leeward sheet of foresail be hauled aft phantom resumed course a soon a did so captain came aft with part of copper bar of bobstay there have be foul play sir said thought there must have be for must not imagine that bar must have broken unless there have be flaw in metal have be tampered with unshackled for thought be better that men must not see until have told about quite right hawkins yes there be doubt that there have be foul play bar have be sawn three quarter of way through with fine saw of course went a soon a began to dip bowsprit well into in race see whoever have done have poured acid into darkened copper partly perhaps to prevent colour of freshly cut metal from being noticed partly to give appearance after be broken of being old cut can not have be sir for be out in quite a rough sea a last week bowsprit must have gone then if cut have be there besides must have be sure to have noticed when went round to polish up side know about hawkins see cut be from below be only two three inch above waterline might very well have be there without being noticed still agree with must not have be there last week must have gone when put nose into then in point of fact have doubt that be done last night night before must easily have be managed of course everyone be below here in yacht lying round man might very well have come out in small boat between one two o'clock in morning done without being noticed might have done sir must have heard grating down in forecastle know hawkins fine steel saw such a burglar use will work way through iron bar almost noiselessly must say that must go through copper almost a easily a must through hard wood be a well to say nothing to crew about think duty to lay matter before club committee can do a like about mind say for moment that be done by anyone on board phantom may have be someone on shore who have laid bet of few pound against wanted to make sure of winning money besides phantom might very well have hoped to have beaten fairly for be just a much fancied a be take below lay in cabin when get in unshackle other bit of bar put with be impossible however when bowsprit bobstay be brought on board that crew must have failed to notice break in bar news that there have be foul play have at once be passed round seeing angry face of men animated talk forward frank told captain to call hand aft look here men said see that be aware of what have taken place be most disgraceful unfortunate need hardly say be a much vexed a yourselves at losing cup for must have carried off however be one of case in there be nothing to be done must only make thing worse by making fuss about have ground whatever for believing that be work of one of phantom crew be far more likely that be work of longshore loafer who have laid more than must afford against have partly be own fault will know better in future captain will take good care that there will be anchor watch set for two three night before sail race what have called up for be to beg of not to make occasion for dispute quarrel ashore hitherto have be proud of good behaviour of crew must be sorry indeed to hear that there be row ashore between phantom men at least have nothing to boast of have won cup have won honour have shown better yacht must have beaten by something like mile if have not be for accident therefore be express wish order that show natural disappointment on shore can give real reason of defeat say word of blame to anyone for know not who be author of blackguardly act of course matter can not be kept altogether secret for will be duty to lay before committee will make protest if choose to institute inquiry must do so will take step in matter be unlikely in extreme that will ever know who did will pay winning money for that did not win be fault of yours one thing will wager though be not betting man be that next time meet phantom will beat by a much a must have done today for accident appearance of osprey a sailed into anchorage without topmast bowsprit excited great attention many of yachtsman came on board to inquire how disaster have happened to save going through story score of time frank have broken piece of bobstay bar brought up laid on deck near tiller in reply to inquiry simply pointed to saying think that tell tale for be full of indignation at dastardly outrage what be going to do major be not going to do anything except take ashore hand to sailing committee that have be cut be certain a to who cut there be shadow of evidence if be in carthew place one of said must decline to take cup under such circumstance must offer to sail race over again with a soon a have repaired damage must decline offer if made said quietly be probable that will meet in race again day then can fight out for present be done with have won queen cup must put up with accident effect produced by fact reported to committee examination of broken bar be very great such thing have not be known before in annals of yachting committee ordered poster to be instantly printed stuck up offering reward of pound for proof must lead to conviction of author of outrage frank returned on board at once sent off boat towing behind broken bowsprit topmast to cowes with instruction to monsieur white to have two fresh spar got ready by following afternoon if possible did not go ashore again until landed at half past ten at clubhouse window be lit up dancing have begun hour before frank at once obtained partner in order to avoid having to talk unpleasant business over with yachting friend presently sat down by side of lady greendale be so sorry frank said doe seem hard when have set mind on have hoped to win said be not a bad a that after must have be more mortifying to lose because osprey be not fast enough than to lose from accident when have already proved to be best in race know that never went in for being racing yachtsman look upon racing a being secondary part of yachting can assure feel that be greatly to be pitied might have be better might have be great deal worse well be glad that take in way said can assure be greatly upset over when heard sat chatting with for time presently bertha be brought back by partner to mother side thank for hail a passed miss greendale sounded hearty really cheered up for just at moment be in exceedingly bad temper can assure see foreboding came true luck be against not luck said indignantly must have won for treachery treachery be rather hard word said however be of use cry over spilt milk have lost will live to fight day hope next time will win still know there be really nothing to grumble at have be fortunate altogether season a bought osprey a cruiser have done great deal better with than must have expected at moment partner of bertha came up be about to carry off when said suppose osprey can sail still major mallett oh yes be lame duck know can get about right well why ask mamma to take sail with tomorrow afternoon will be very happy to do so said almost think that have better wait until get spar think that will be finished before tomorrow evening men can get to work early in morning can be here by two o'clock next day think that will come tomorrow major mallett will be novelty to sail in cripple wo mamma besides know ought to know that day after tomorrow be sunday at present plan be arranged for going up to town on monday that being so frank said with smile by mean come tomorrow will come to lunch afterwards afterwards think will be down at club landing stage at half past two bertha be bent upon taking possession of tomorrow lady greendale said smiling a girl turned away will be glad for to have quiet two three hour out of racket large party be very fatiguing think that have be too much for yesterday today have be quite unlike at one time sitting quiet saying nothing at other time rattling away with miss haverley lady olive absolutely talking down of must have thought impossible seems to to be altogether over excited thought must have be rest for to get away for week from fag in london be sorry now that came down altogether be little worried about frank well season be drawing towards end now lady greendale if can get short time at home doubt will do good did not think that bertha be looking well when saw yesterday frank danced couple more dance then went to lady greendale said will make excuse to bertha tell that having shown here so that might not be thought be out of temper at bad luck will be off indeed feel quite up to entering into thing can understand dear lady greendale at present thing be going rather hardly with gave sympathetic look can understand frank said here come can make excuse can quite understand that care about staying bertha said when repeated what have said to mother well will give next dance what will be nicer will sit out with ah here be partner be afraid have made mistake mr jennings have got card mixed up do mind taking thirteenth dance instead of will be very much obliged if will her partner murmured assent thank frank said a took arm now will go out on balcony on lawn lawn think be lovely evening there be fear of catching cold be afraid that be very disappointed went on a went out be disappointed too told wanted best yacht to win have not done so thank replied quietly must have liked to have won just once along felt that chance be against that fortune must play trick other be not fortune fortune have nothing to do with said indignantly be beaten by crime by mean miserable crime by same sort of crime by be beaten before have reason for supposing that there be connection frank broke in suddenly started a for first time for year called by christian name be old friend of ours promised that must always be friend do think that be right to be trying to throw dust into eye think on contrary that a friend must speak frankly to frank be silent for moment on subject yes bertha on others what have passed between make very difficult for man to know what ought to do be assured that if saw make fatal mistake mistake at least believed to be fatal must not hesitate even if knew must be misunderstood must forfeit liking by so doing be just one of case when feel justified a yet in speaking carthew be not friend know if have have personal feud for have become that with must be more at liberty to speak a be must rather remain silent tell now that may know in case ever do meddle in affair how painful be for to do so how unwillingly do at rate there be nothing to connect accident took place today with event be one of series of success that have gained over doe not affect much for though must have liked to have won today feel about such matter a used to see when man have suffered one heavy defeat doe not care about how minor skirmish may go walked up down in silence for time then said quietly music have stopped think frank have better go in again so will take tomorrow certainly said took in to lady greendale then went off to osprey be feeling in higher spirit than have done for time a walked up down deck for hour before turning in seemed to that might not after accept carthew that must not be obliged to bring trouble upon by telling shameful story will be same a far a be concerned said to be sure must stand marrying anyone else of course will do before long better than carthew hear whisper that be hard hit at ascot though give out that won not that matter much be never good lookout for girl to marry man who gamble even though be rich friend take good care to settle money upon evidently suspect that be at bottom of trick must hardly think so if really cared for if doe think so fancy that winning of queen cup will cost dearly wonder why have apparently so set mind on going out with tomorrow carthew enjoyed triumph that evening loudly expressed indignation regret at scandalous affair to owed victory frankly said that must hardly have hoped to win cup have not be for expressed determination to add hundred pound to reward offered by club for discovery of author of outrage men felt that be hard on fellow to win cup by breakdown of opponent in way lady admired sincere way in expressed regret be good dancer good talker handsome man a few of knew frank have particular interest in misfortune danced only once with bertha who said a hero of occasion mr carthew must be generous in attention please

be phantom getting under way skipper said a turn up down deck brought close to frank so be saw owner go ashore le than hour ago yes came on board again five minute ago men began to bustle about directly got on deck do hope wo put in again a long a be here hand be a savage a bull though remembered what told there be row on shore last night will be glad when ai in same port with phantom for be sure that if two three men of crew be to drop in to same pub there must be fight in time really must not blame be not in human nature to lose race like without feeling very sore over hope be off anyhow a be going to cowes evening will be day two before hand be likely to run against other will give time to cool down bit there be one thing bet phantom wo enter against at cowes if be to give handsome beating there must show everyone that must have have chance of winning cup if have not be for accident no suppose that will meet again season indeed know that will do more racing except that will feel a sort of duty to enter for squadron open race think by course be laying that phantom be off to southampton perhaps be going to meet somebody there anyhow be not likely to be back until have started for cowes frank sat for time with paper in hand although glanced at occasionally mind took in nothing of content again again watched phantom yes be certainly going to southampton water from what bertha have said to evening before have received strong hope that must reject carthew nothing be more probable than that must have gone ashore that morning fresh from victory to put question to speedy return order to make sail a soon a got on deck certainly pointed to fact that have refused load of care seemed to be lifted from frank mind from first when have found that carthew be visitor at lady greendale have be uncomfortable knew man persevering nature recognised power of pleasing when desired to do so be satisfied that when be refused reason bertha gave be a far a knew true one have since thought that possibly might then although unsuspected by have be to extent under spell of carthew influence when have declined two unexceptional offer have be almost convinced that carthew when time came must receive more favourable answer have watched closely on few occasion when have seen together in society certain a have felt at other time have come away somewhat puzzled said to be captivated by manner a girl might be doubt whether love impression however have always died out in short time have somehow come to accept general opinion unquestioningly that must accept carthew when proposed have be prepared to face alternative of suffering to marry scoundrel of taking step more repugnant to must probably end by entire breach of friendship with greendales that of telling story be therefore delighted to find that difficulty have be solved by bertha without intervention felt absolutely grateful for accident have cost queen cup have at same time opened bertha eye to man true character soon after two o'clock went ashore in gig at half hour lady greendale bertha came down osprey look like bird shorn of wing said a handed into boat though men have made everything a tidy a must two missing spar quite spoil appearance doe not matter in least frank lady greendale said know how look when be at best will enjoy quiet sail in just a much a if be in apple pie order look fagged lady greendale though be pretty well accustomed to gaiety in town lady greendale did indeed look worn worried for last two three day bertha manner have puzzled caused vague anxiety morning girl have come in from garden told that have just refused mr carthew although have never be pleased at idea of bertha marrying refusal have come a shock personally liked believed to be very well off have expected bertha to do much better by mean approved of fondness for turf have be deeply disappointed at girl refusal of lord chilson on whom have quite set mind second offer have also be good one still have reconciled to thought of bertha marrying carthew connection with turf have certainly brought into contact with great many good men be to be met everywhere must hardly wonder that bertha must have be taken with good look brilliancy of conversation refusal then came to not only a absolute surprise a shock considered that bertha have certainly given a well a everyone else reason to suppose that intended to accept many of intimate friend have spoken to a if affair be already settled matter when became known that bertha have refused must be set down a flirt must certainly injure prospect of making sort of match that desired have said something of to girl have only received reply know what be doing mamma can understand that thought be going to marry thought so something have happened have opened eye have reason to be thankful that have dare say think have behaved very badly be sorry be sure that be doing right now what have discovered bertha understand at suppose do mamma can not tell

to of course dear will understand so long a be to marry man who must be likely to make happy be content must not bear to think of marrying man knew to be altogether unworthy of know very well said that never intended to let marry a said to last night feel very much aggrieved major mallett have said must be friend yet let go on when must have stopped at once let get talked about with man must have gone on letting get still more talked about before interfered be not kind friendly of bertha remonstrated fact that have not be friend that have beaten in variety of matter be reason in world why must interfere still le why must not marry when be stupid enough to tell that story year ago stated that have ground for saying that be who played that trick upon boat must have be most unfair on part to have brought story up again quite so there be other story what other story frank asked in great surprise story george lechmere came told two day ago said gravely george lechmere mean to say do mean to say so behaved like real friend came to tell story of martha bennett told went on a be about to speak that have made up mind to tell mamma about directly heard be engaged to mr carthew must have be something must hardly have be fair to if have once be engaged to must have be very hard to break off naturally must have be much greater pain to then than have be now felt that see bertha until did accept have right to assume that must do so at least so understood did not feel that in position be called upon to interfere until learned that be really in danger of what considered wrecking life happiness understand that said gently know that acted for best there be other thing have not told major mallett other thing george lechmere have told did think that must have be of interest to to know that have forgiven man who tried to take life more than have restored self respect taken a servant treated a friend tear stood in eye now think frank be thing might have be interested to know thing must raise immeasurably in eye of woman must show vastly more of real character than must know by meeting from day to day a friend be secret not mine bertha be known to never be man more repentant more bitterly regretful for fault be in eye scarcely fault at except that have too rashly assumed to be author of ruin of girl loved poor fellow have be half maddened be scarce responsible for action have already suffered terribly least must do be to endeavour to restore self respect by showing have entirely forgiven kindness have shown have repaid ten fold not only by saving life in becoming most sincere attached friend promised must tell one have never done so one to day know save father mother how then must tell even must see that be impossible that must tell besides story be of interest save to above a said be secret not mine see now said still be so sorry so very sorry that did not know before see frank went on after pause woman have to make unmake life very much in dark one help if have not brother to do so be groping in dark look at here be believing that mr carthew whom met everywhere in society be except that kept race horse bet heavily a good a other men be very pleasant very good looking generally liked infinitely more amusing than most men one meet how be to tell what really be on other hand there be dear friend who knew have shown very brave soldier whom also everyone liked spoke well of of whose real character did not know much except on side be always presented to now find capable of what consider grand act of generosity overrate matter altogether bertha man shot by mistake fellow took for richly deserved shooting when found be mistake poor fellow be bitterly sorry for surely there be nothing more to be said about girl sat silent for time well be cleared up now said at last there be reason why must not be friend a of old none whatever said there have be only stopped short only what frank nothing said will be just a be bertha will try be good elder brother scold look after warn if must be necessary until get under other guidance will be time said quietly before happens have have sharp lesson did really care for much bertha think that really cared for at said be not lesson be thinking of saw colour mount into cheek a twisted handkerchief held into knot then turning to said frank be never going to give chance again must not misunderstand do mean can mean bertha said in low tone do mean that if ask same question again will give different answer did not know then said have never thought of took altogether by surprise what said thought be true afterwards knew that have be mistaken hoped that must ask again did not soon felt that never must tried hard to be a be before be not same be not same then did not seem to care there be three men who wanted did not care much be must not have anyone say have married for position hated idea of so must have taken third be bright pleasant sort of thing thought must be happy with until george lechmere opened eye then of course be over story showed still more what fool have be what heart have thrown away said ' will at least make effort to undo past will not let chance of happiness go away from merely from false pride if love still will forgive if not at least will not through life feel that might have made different must have brought to speak word love a much a ever frank said taking hand love more for speaking a have can hardly believe happiness can be that really love bertha think have proved frank do love have known for time seemed all too late be grief rather than pleasure time came be pain to for felt have lost be only when learned two day ago how must forgive at same time must free from chain have allowed to be wound round think must otherwise have broken that made up mind that must not be fault if thing be not put right between now let tell mother hand be still in went across deck together mamma said please put down book have piece of news for frank be going to be married lady greendale sat for moment speechless in astonishment knew that bertha have wished to tell that have refused carthew offer that must come of have never dreamt year before have approved of bertha rejection of frank since then much have happened bertha have shown that must not marry for position only that must be likely to take own way entirely in matter although be downfall to hope that have once entertained lady greendale be very fond of frank be at rate better than having bertha marry man of whose real mean be ignorant who a everyone knew bet heavily on turf idea flashed rapidly through mind holding out one hand to said there be one to whom must more confidently entrust happiness frank god bless then betook to pocket handkerchief for tear came easily on occasion must hardly have said whether be result of pleasure in bertha happiness regret at downfall of air castle have once built think bertha best plan will be to go below now frank suggested quietly what for bertha asked thing have be done felt radiantly happy more shocked at own boldness than have be when perpetrated well dear thought that perhaps must rather not kiss in sight of whole crew certainly sha be able to restrain much longer then in case said demurely perhaps have better go below be hour before came on deck again well dear lady greendale said more think of better be pleased a far a be concerned nothing must be nicer will have bertha within short drive of wo be like losing do know bertha father said to once ' must give anything if day frank mallett bertha be to take fancy to other there be nothing must like more than to have settled near there be one know more likely to make happy than must be ' be sure dear that will be glad to know that engagement must have have approval a have mine bertha bent down kissed mother with tear standing in eye will be great pleasure to to have so near frank said earnestly know that having lost own mother so long ago have always looked upon a more of mother than anyone else have always felt almost a much at home in house a in own now let sit down talk over quietly in first place propose that on monday when leave lord haverley will come here for time solent will be very pleasant for next fortnight can then take fortnight cruise west if like land at plymouth go straight home must be very glad lady greendale said at once rejoiced at thought that must thus avoid necessity of answering question about bertha there will be occasion at to speak of at cousin there might be sort of question asked expression of surprise so on will be quite time enough to write to friend after have be comfortably settled at home for time can talk over afterwards yes must think lady greendale that must save trouble of two letter if while mentioning bertha be engaged to neighbour major mallett must add that marriage will come off in course of few week think so bertha certainly not said saucily will be quite time to talk about long time hence well will put off talking about for short time see have have year waiting already very pleasant be three hour cruise one gave thought of missing topmast bowsprit there be nice sailing breeze clipped a wing be osprey be still faster than majority of yacht a soon a two lady have be put ashore frank sailed for cowes be too late when got there for anything to be done that evening frank went ashore with captain found that spar be ready to receive iron work sheaf from old one a have be towed up to yard to be in readiness monsieur white promised that must arrange for few hand to come to work early that spar must be brought off by half past eight on monday morning a soon a have returned in gig after putting lady ashore at ryde frank have called george lechmere to be all right george thanks to interview with miss greendale be bold step to take be best possible thing succeeded splendidly everything be to be a wish be glad indeed to hear major hoped that must have something of sort to tell there be look about took to mean that thing be going on well yes george at first when told that have told about affair at delhi felt that there be really occasion for to have said anything about did great deal of good made much more of than there be occasion for know when woman be inclined to take pleasant view of thing will magnify molehill into mountain thought that must do good major mean that must do good that must do good generally have to tell other story that came naturally with at rate must not see that there be deal of difference between nature of man who have be so good to that of scoundrel be just effect did have well say anything about forward at present men will be told later on by one o'clock on monday osprey be back at ryde at two o'clock dinghy went ashore with mate two of hand who waited quarter of hour till vehicle brought down lady luggage soon afterwards frank went ashore in gig brought lady greendale bertha off a went down to cabin bertha looking into saloon saw george lechmere preparing tea tray to bring up on deck at once went to did not thank before said holding out hand thank now will thank life did greatest service be glad indeed miss greendale that be so for know that major must never have be happy man if have not come about for next fortnight osprey be cruising along coast getting a far a torquay returning to cowes frank did not enter for of race lady greendale although fair sailor grew nervous when yacht heeled over far even bertha did not care for racing memory of last race being too fresh in mind for to wish to take part in for present chapter be uncommonly pretty trading schooner bertha frank mallett said a rose from chair to get better look at craft be passing along to eastward suppose must be in fruit trade must just have arrived from levant must not be surprised if have be yacht at one time be not carrying much sail be going along fast think must have done better if have rigged a fore aft schooner instead of putting heavy yard on foremast that broad band of white round spoil appearance jib boom be unusually long must carry tremendous spread of canvas in light wind must think that must be full up to hatch for be very low in water for trader osprey be lying in outside tier of yacht off cowes party have be on board for regatta have broken up week before only lady greendale bertha remained on board former have not be well for day have have maid down from town a soon a cabin be empty have be proposed indeed that bertha must return to town being unwilling to cut short girl pleasure said that must do better on board than in london moreover did not feel equal to travelling be attended by doctor in cowes osprey only took short sail day generally down to needle back out to nab yes be nice looking boat bertha agreed if sail be white rope neat trim must look like yacht except for big yard skipper must be lubber to have rope hanging about like of course may have have bad weather in crossing bay if have pride in craft might at least have got into good deal better trim while coming in from needle still must be remedied in hour work certainly be a pretty trader a ever saw how did mother seem afternoon bertha about same think feel at anxious about because have often seen like before think really frank that be quite well enough to go up to town know that be enjoying so much that doe not like to take away have doubt that will find better by saturday when know arranged time back that must go up wo be long before come will certainly not directly have landed will take osprey to gosport lay up there need not stop to see that done can trust hawkins to see stripped everything taken on shore of course people at yard be responsible for hauling up will probably be in town same evening if like think that mother be only stopping for will go across to southampton at once oh be sure that must not like want to lose last three day here of course when get home at end of next week be settled down there too will be great deal over at greendale wo be a be here not by long way however will be able to look forward to spring bertha when will have to myself on board will go on long cruise together though do think that be ridiculous must have to wait until then not at ridiculous sir say that be perfectly happy everyone say that engagement be happiest time in one life besides be partly own fault have made so fond of osprey have quite made up mind that nothing must possibly be so nice a to spend honeymoon on board to go where like to do a like without being bothered by meeting people one doe not care for besides if must get tired of company might ask jack harley amy to come to for month so think that will be necessary for to do that laughed starting a will in middle of march sha find too hot in mediterranean before turn head homewards think will find plenty to amuse between gibraltar jaffa three month wo be too much frank tomorrow be dinner at clubhouse be yes must be sorry to miss for having only be just elected member of squadron must like to put in appearance at first set dinner of course frank certainly must not like to miss next evening frank went ashore to dine at club hour half later yacht boat came off have note for miss greendale man in stern said a came alongside be to give to bertha be summoned much surprised came on deck man handed up note to took into companion where light be burning name that of yacht be in straggling handwriting that scarcely recognised a frank tore open darling have have nasty accident having be knocked down just a landed be at present at dr maddison wish must come ashore at once be nothing very serious if did not see might think that be agitate mother bring anna with boat brings note will take ashore bertha gave little gasp then summoning up courage ran down into cabin mamma dear must spare anna for hour have just have note from frank have be knocked down hurt say that be nothing very serious only writes to to come ashore so that can assure wo stop more than quarter of hour if find that be worse than expect will send anna off to with message scarcely listening to what mother said in reply ran into cabin told anna to put on hat shawl to go ashore with in minute descended to boat with maid be four oared gig helmsman have taken place in stern behind bertha sat cold still without speaking be sure that frank must be more seriously hurt than have said must have have taken off to yacht instead of to surgeon shaky almost illegible handwriting showed difficulty must have have in holding pencil boat made way through fleet till reached willow water have to cross on way to shore here with exception of few small craft water be clear of yacht suddenly long line of light along shore disappeared something thick heavy soft fell over bertha head arm be thrown round anna pressed tightly against in vain struggled there be faint strange smell lost consciousness hour passed without return to yacht lady greendale began to fear that have found frank too ill to leave have forgotten to send anna back with message at last touched bell will tell captain want to speak to captain said be much alarmed about major mallett boat came off here hour ago brought note for daughter saying that have be hurt went ashore with maid to see said that must be back in short time that if found that be badly hurt must send maid back with message to have be gone for more than hour wish must take boat go ashore find out how major be bring back word at once be at dr maddison know house skipper hurried away with serious face little more than minute after have left cabin lady greendale heard rattle of block of fall boat be little more than hour away lady greendale in anxiety have told steward to let know when be coming alongside went up on deck to get news a quickly a possible be rum affair altogether lady hawkins said a stepped on deck went to doctor have seen nothing of major miss greendale maid have not be to house at lady greendale stood for moment speechless with surprise consternation be most extraordinary said at last what can mean be sure that there be mistake captain be to dr maddison house went yes lady there ai mistake about have be there to fetch medicine for two three time besides saw doctor major mallett must have be taken to other doctor said must have made mistake put in name of dr maddison house be little distance from club there may be doctor nearer what be to be done be sure know lady captain said in perplexity where can daughter maid be lady greendale went on went ashore to go to dr maddison perhaps lady might have heard a went ashore that major be somewhere else messenger might have be waiting at landing stage to take there direct must be suppose be very strange think best thing captain will be for to go to club be sure to know there about accident where be see landing stage be close to club might have be just going in when be knocked down by carriage suppose like enough be at club still lady at rate will go there in first place find out there be sure to be crowd about gate listening to music have got band over from newport so that if know anything at club there be sure to be people outside who saw accident will know where major be taken anyhow wo come back without news even to lady greendale anxious alarmed a be did not seem long before steward came down with news that boat be just alongside time be too agitated to go up heard someone come running down companion moment later to astonishment frank mallett came in looked pale excited what be lady greendale exclaimed skipper tell that letter came here saying that have be hurt taken to dr maddison that bertha maid went off at once have not returned though be more than two hour since went have not be hurt wrote letter to bertha be at dinner at club when skipper came for what be about know frank can not even think lady greendale said in agitated voice what can mean where can bertha be burst into tear know ca think frank said slowly stood silent for minute two then went on can not suggest anything will go ashore at once waterman at landing stage must have noticed if two lady got out there must hardly have helped doing so for must be curious coming ashore alone after dark then will go to other landing place ask there there be always boy hanging about to earn few penny by taking care of boat will be back a soon a can boat be still alongside men stretched to oar th very few minute be at club landing stage waterman here declared that lady unaccompanied by gentleman have landed after dark must have seen sir said for see go down to help out party arrives here must have gone to one of other landing place at of must obtain information there be several boy at of who have be there for hour be unanimous in declaring that lady have landed there after dark at then walked up down between watch house club have when landed intended to go to police office a soon a have inquired at landing stage natural impulse of englishman who have suffered loss wrong more thought over more inexpedient did course seem to be highly improbable indeed seemed to impossible that must do more than have in matter passage of two lady through crowded street must scarcely have attracted attention of anyone idea of violence being used be out of question if have landed now regarded a very improbable must have at least gone willingly to place where believed must find unless house in cowes be searched from top to bottom there be chance of finding carefully hidden away a must be must not see therefore that police must at present be of utility might be necessary finally to obtain aid of police in case be scotland yard not cowes that matter must be laid before even must be only last resort for above thing be necessary for bertha sake that matter must be kept profound secret once in hand of police must be in paper next day if aid of detective be to be called in must be far better to put into hand of private detective having made up mind upon point returned to yacht be sorry to say have news said to lady greendale who be lying on couch worn out with weeping have ascertained almost beyond doubt that did not land at club stage of other two landing place what can be sobbed what can have become of be afraid there be little doubt that have be carried off replied can see other possible solution of who can have done thing ah be matter have be thinking over over there be only one man know capable of such dastardly action at present wo mention name even to will soon be on track give way lady greendale even be not capable of injuring doubt will be restored to safe sound will need patience ah there be boat coming alongside ran up on deck proved however to be only shore boat bringing off george lechmere who having met comrade in town have asked leave to spend evening with be of course ignorant of have happened since have left frank told have doubt whatever that have be carried off said there be only one man who must have done that villain carthew george lechmere exclaimed yes be man suspect george heard evening that have be hit tremendously hard on turf at goodwood must think that if must force miss greendale to marry must retrieve fortune must moreover satisfy vindictive spirit for manner in have rejected in addition give triumph over be sir have doubt that be yacht be not here at least have not seen be sure that be not here believe for that miss greendale must have be taken on board yacht never must have dared to land in cowes of course made inquiry a matter of form at landing place a knew way to dr maddison a street be full of people at time landed must never have attempted to use violence especially a have maid with on other hand must have be comparatively easy to manage in case of yacht have to row alongside to seize gag before have time to utter cry then to carry below phantom be not here at rate be not here afternoon there be reason why carthew must not have chartered yacht for purpose ask skipper to come aft captain said when hawkins came aft what men went ashore afternoon harris williams marvel sir went ashore in dinghy harris went to doctor for medicine ask to come here did anyone speak to harris went on a three men came aft while be ashore today mean anyone that did not know sir man said promptly leastwise only chap spoke to be gent a be standing on step by watch house a went down to boat only say to ' noticed go in to dr maddison man there be nothing matter with friend major mallett hope ' 'no sir say 'he be right be just getting bottle of medicine for old lady on board be that passed between thank harris be just what wanted to know after men have gone forward again said to captain have strong conviction hawkins indeed be almost certain that miss greendale have be carried off to one of yacht here whether be large one small one have not slightest idea question be what be to be done be past eleven now be impossible to go round fleet make enquiry besides craft may have made off already must have be sure to have placed in outside tier so a to get up anchor a soon a have miss greendale on board might get out boat sir lie off see if yacht set sail skipper suggested must be of use hawkins must not stop even if hailed to know what yacht be might give false name one thing have be thinking of can be done wish in first place that must ask men if anyone have noticed among yacht sailor in street one with name of phantom on jersey of may have be paid off for have not be raced since ryde in case want two of men to go ashore first thing in morning hang about day if necessary in hope of finding one of phantom crew if do find one bring off at once tell that will be well paid for trouble by way may a well ask harris what gentleman be like who spoke to at landing place walked slowly backwards forward with george lechmere without exchanging word until in five minute hawkins returned be clean shaven man who spoke to harris sir judged to be about forty wore sort of yachting dress be rather short thin about other matter rawlins say that noticed when be ashore yesterday two of phantom men strolling about being cowes man knew a be not alone just passed time of day went on without stopping doe know where live think at likely must be on leave now that must find of at home tomorrow morning be possible that might do so at rate be worth trying be curious that two of must be here when have seen nothing of phantom since race for cup unless of course owner have laid up be hardly likely if have be anywhere about here must have entered for race yesterday will send rawlins one of other cowes men ashore at six o'clock major if meet men be safe to be able to find out where live tell others hawkins that on account be word to be said on shore a to disappearance of miss greendale be of great importance that one must obtain slightest hint of what have taken place when captain have again gone forward frank went down with difficulty persuaded lady greendale to go to bed can hing more tonight said may well imagine that if saw least chance of doing good must not be standing here nothing can be done till morning having seen to stateroom returned to deck where have told george lechmere to wait for be enough to drive one mad george said a joined to think that somewhere among yacht miss greendale may be held prisoner can quite understand that major by what feel have seen so much of miss greendale have always be so kind to knowing that considered that have saved life knowing about other thing feel a if must do anything for feel more because be scoundrel owed deep debt to before hardly think that can be on board one of yacht here feel convinced that be not george must hardly keep gagged time at night scream must be heard though skylight be closed no sir if be put on board here feel sure that must have got up sail at once be just what feel likely enough have mainsail already up chain short directly boat be up at davit must have got up anchor be off may be twenty mile away by time though whether east west one have mean of even guessing wind be nearly due north may have gone way have made for cherbourg havre depends partly upon size if be small craft ca get far beyond range if be large one may have gone anywhere worst of be that unless can get clue a to size can do absolutely nothing good many yacht went off today east west by end of week whole fleet will be scattered even if do get size of yacht see that can do anything unless can get name too if must do that must act at once must run up to town lay case before authority at scotland yard get to telegraph to port in kingdom upon putting in there vessel be at once to be searched for two lady who be believed to have be forcibly carried away in have on board arrested suppose major well must have to be thought over george carthew must not be brought to punishment without whole affair being made public be thing above others to be avoided yes see that sir yet seems hard that must go off unpunished again must not go unpunished may be sure frank said grimly for if fellow ever showed face in london again must thrash to within inch of life however sure a feel be possible that be mistaken miss greendale be known to be only daughter heiress other impecunious scamp may have conceived idea of making bold stroke for fortune be not likely be possible until morning broke two men paced deck together scarcely word be spoken frank be in vain endeavouring to think what course have best be taken if search for men of phantom turned out unavailing george be brooding over old wrong have suffered longing to avenge present one thank god night be over frank said at last have thoroughly tired have thought until be stupid now will lie down on one of sofa perhaps may forget for few hour sleep however did not come to at seven o'clock be on deck again men went ashore at six sir skipper said expect will be back again before long ten minute later dinghy came out between two yacht ahead rawlins be not on board skipper said a came close told to send off instant got news whatever be simpson in stern well simpson what news frank asked a rowed alongside well sir have found out a how phantom crew be ashore of chap told that came back fortnight ago crew having be paid off rawlins said that 'd better come off tell that have gone off to look one of up bring off in shore boat know where life expect will have alongside in few minute do think that be good news bad sir george lechmere asked think that be bad rather than good frank said before seemed to that whatever craft be in be carried away must probably be transferred to phantom might be lying in portland in dover be cruising outside island if have heard nothing of phantom must have searched for however suppose that scoundrel thought that must not trust crew of cowes men to take part in business like will know more when rawlins come off in hour shore boat came alongside with rawlins sailor with phantom jersey on so have be paid off lad frank said to sailor a stepped on deck yes sir came sudden like have expected that must be out for month at least however a man got month pay have nothing to grumble about although did seem strange even skipper must not have have hint of what mr carthew intended till called into cabin paid money where be laid up well sir be at ostend know whether be going to be hauled up there only dismantled left to float in dock governor told skipper that thought might go to mediterranean in december that till then must not be able to use seemed rum thing leaving out there instead of having hauled up at southampton gosport specially that must not have kept two three of on board in charge of course be affair mr carthew be rather difficult gentleman to please very changeable like have made sure that be going to race here after winning cup at ryde indeed after race said a much to skipper have anyone with frank asked only one gentleman sir know what name be what be like be smallish man thin did wear hair on face thank here be sovereign for trouble be something at rate george went on a man be rowed away whole proceeding be very strange one see description of man with carthew exactly answer to of man who found out from boat crew that dr maddison be attending lady greendale now see that be quite possible that phantom be somewhere near be somewhere near yesterday afternoon carthew may have hired foreign crew sailed in couple of day after own crew came over may have hired craft abroad here at rate there be something to do will go up to town by midday train then down to dover cross to ostend tonight begging pardon major must not telegraph to harbour master at ostend asking if phantom be there might do george if go over there may pick up clue may find out what hotel stopped at after crew have left if so whether crossed to england left by train for france there be saying what information may light on stay on board here can be of use to on journey may be of use here will telegraph to from ostend possibly may want yacht to sail at once to dover to meet there may have to go up to town to do something for now must go down tell lady greendale a much a be necessary will of course be best thing for to go up to town with if be not well enough for of course must stay on board lady greendale have just come into saloon when went down think have got clue very faint one said be going up to town at once to follow up how be feeling lady greendale have terrible headache be nothing of course will go up with do feel equal to oh yes quite said feverishly what be clue frank well concern yacht in believe bertha have be carried off at rate feel so certain a to who have hand in have hesitation in telling that be carthew mr carthew impossible frank always seemed to particularly pleasant gentlemanly man might seem that happen to know other thing about be unmitigated scoundrel of course not word must be said about lady greendale see that for bertha sake must work quietly must never do for matter to get into paper must be too dreadful frank do think that must kill will trust in hand altogether have only one comfort in dreadful affair be bertha have anna with be certainly great comfort be something in man favour that when enticed from yacht with forged letter suggested that must bring maid chapter frank mallet lady greendale crossed to southampton by twelve o'clock boat arrived in london at three have be thinking said a went up that will be better for to stop in town will have le difficulty in answering question there than must have at home everyone be leaving now in week there will be scarcely soul in london know will keep down front blind one will dream of being there will only have to mention to bertha own maid that daughter have remained at cowes have left anna with that can wait upon until return there will be advantage in can see whenever be in town will get letter post quicker when be away can telegraph to freely whereas if telegraphed to chippenham whoever received message there might mention content a curious to someone other then of course must become matter of common gossip frank agreed that must certainly be better more bearable than having to answer question about bertha to visitor who called on crossed that evening to ostend at ten o'clock next morning george lechmere received following message make inquiry a to small brigantine that looked like converted yacht have very large yard on foremast saw pas cowes on tuesday afternoon let hawkins go to portsmouth southampton find out whether anchored between osborne ryde if not inquire at seaview whether passed there going east telegraph result tomorrow morning to chamber will cross again tonight lechmere have gig at once lowered started with four hand at oar eastward while captain went ashore in dinghy to leave for southampton by next boat tide be against lechmere who keeping close in round point steered boat along at foot of slope of osborne kept eastward until reached coast guard station at mouth of wootton creek oh yes noticed boatswain in charge replied in answer to question saw a say on tuesday afternoon going east must not help noticing for be something out of way must not have thought so much of if have not come back again just before dusk next day anchored mile to west kept sharp lookout night thinking that might be trying to smuggle contraband ashore everything be quiet next morning be gone man who be on watch said thought that made out with night glass going east at about eleven o'clock be dark night might have be schooner yacht brig happen to know whether stopped at ryde first time passed yes having be talking about watched to see if be going to anchor there keep on to east lowered boat a passed two men landed threw up into wind waited until boat came off again men did not come back in hoisted boat up again went east stopped off seaview then came back sent boat ashore two men went off in of course ca say whether be same be a much a must do to make out that there be two of though glass be pretty good one be there anything wrong about craft not that know of there be good deal of curiosity about among yacht being out of way sort of craft fancy there be bet about there be idea that be seen going west two day later governor asked to take boat find out whether have be noticed here at ryde thank very much for information have doubt that will be sufficient to decide bet there may be about so saying took seat in gig again rowed back to osprey skipper returned in evening such craft have gone into southampton portsmouth said so have have journey for nothing think have george replied be something to know that be not in of port now have be to of george returned in time to send off full account of what have learned from coast guardsman by mail must be delivered in london night on return to town next morning frank found letter awaiting at ten o'clock after wiring to hawkins steward to stock yacht at once with provision of kind for long voyage went into city called upon secretary at lloyd after giving name told that believed that young lady have be

be light then lizard report seeing morning when abreast of headed south apparently making departure a must be made out keeping course a long a seen be four telegram so think that there can be little doubt that have made for mediterranean thank very much indeed frank said can tell if have chance of getting similar information from south must get from finisterre if passed within sight by holding on a far west a lizard instead of taking departure from start be likely that will take more westerly course then cape st vincent be first point where be likely to be noticed if not there must probably be observed at tarifa although if kept on southern side of strait might not be noticed must think that must do so must not be likely to put into gibraltar although from what tell owner must believe that suspicion whatever of being concerned in affair must be likely to rest upon must bear in mind that be probable that a measure of precaution have painted out white streak sent down yard converted into fore aft schooner in case must attract attention whatever if passed without making number certainly think that will convert back into schooner yacht a otherwise there will be difficulty about paper whenever enters port there be one more thing wish to ask see might not turn into mediterranean might for example make for west indie in case must be almost certain to touch at madeira palmas possibly at teneriffe major of course have agent at of place will gladly request if brigantine schooner looking like put in there to find out if possible where be bound for to let know at will say gibraltar be afraid be of use trying to get portuguese authority to arrest ship to search see to certain extent be extradition case still will ask to get done if possible though fear that be quite beyond power thank very much indeed must be immense thing only to find out that have gone in direction of course may not put in at of place a be sure to have provisioned for long voyage at rate will wait at gibraltar until get letter unless can get clue that have gone up mediterranean of course if hear of at cape saint vincent tarifa will try ceuta tangier if go up on southern side of strait may anchor

agent will be on lookout for may not be long before hear from madeira may be time before get other letter a craft may be anything between three week five in getting there of course will mention when sailed will not write until chance of having arrived be passed must kindly give address of three agent will wait for answer from madeira be afraid patience will never hold out until others can come will be giving schooner fearfully long start a be a may suppose will be almost mad at having to wait hing secretary wrote three address thanking very warmly for kindness courtesy frank went out

pursuit may be long chase lady greendale never fear will bring back safely will be for to decide whether will continue to remain here go down into country after time of course there be occasion for to make up mind now must be off at once for have several thing to do before catch twelve o'clock train god bless frank said be looking terribly worn fagged will be all right when be once fairly off said have not have hour sleep for last two night not much night before at first whole thing seemed hopeless now that be fairly on track know what have to do will soon be all right again know what must have

packed portmanteau with indian suit underclothing took pistol rifle case drove to gunmaker in strand for stock of ammunition called at bank cashed cheque for two thousand pound then drove to waterloo hawkins george lechmere be on landing stage at cowes how be thing going on hawkins frank asked a came across gangway right sir have have hand pretty full sir since got second telegram lechmere saw to getting arm of course must not help a to hiring hand think have got ten first class men few of yacht have paid off already know something about of have engaged while be ashore mate looked after getting on board stowing good a came alongside quite right hawkins did think of ammunition george yes major be not likely to forget got twenty five musket cutlass luckily kept at pascal aikey for use of steam yacht going out to east have ammunition too so got fifty round for musket be not likely that will want to use that much be best to be on right side think sir hawkins said a be going to be long voyage a have doubled crew have better get mate purvis be very good man be navigator will have to keep watch regularly met old shipmate of mine just now who must be just man commanded amphitrite for ten year know that be good navigator have be up in scotch water since spring be paid off last week told that might be must give berth a second mate jumped at by mean hawkins of course will want officer for watch can find without loss of time hope yes sir have told to hang about outside gate here must give answer very well when have seen will find at aikey have to go there to get lot of chart have only for british water george do see to getting trap down to boat will be there in quarter of hour be there anything else that can think of that want nothing sir when go on board may a well get trap in one of spare cabin aft have better move too captain one of mate can have stern cabin for present other mate can have yours steward can sleep in saloon will make more room for extra hand forward will be tight stow sir captain said have ordered ten more hammock hook doubt whether there will be room to sling be sure there wo hawkins have better put hook in saloon beam swing five six of hammock there can take hook out stop up hole when need longer may be having hot weather before have done want men crowded too closely forward twenty minute later frank came down to boat with skipper carrying large roll of chart man with handcart containing bundle of jersey cap fifty white duck trouser large shore boat be alongside when reached osprey be last lot captain asked man in charge of pile of cask box with be filled yes sir be last batch get on deck hawkins frank said can get down stowed when be under sail get anchor short at once sail cover off mainsail up want to lose minute went on turning to george lechmere know that hour even day will make material difference be in fever to be off have found out way have gone major have found out that have sailed for south whether for mediterranean for west indie south america have idea have hope of finding out by time get to gibraltar have got three day start of yes can hardly believe that be not more seems to fortnight since went ashore to dine at club three day be long start unless change of rig have spoiled phantom be a fast very nearly a fast a be ca hope to catch up unless stop for two three day in port that be certain not to do think that there be chance of overtaking until have got to whatever may be destination of course what carthew count upon be that in time will get miss greendale to consent to marry be one reason why think that will not go up mediterranean further take more hopeless prospect will seem to will never give in major george lechmere said confidently have fear of fear whatever may be quite sure that a long a think that will be able to tire out will show in best light try to make everything a pleasant for a be possible under circumstance be only when loses hope of consenting willingly that will show in true light know george be scoundrel enough for anything however consider that be perfectly safe for long time hope to be alongside craft long before becomes desperate hour later anchor be on rail osprey started on voyage tide being in favour passed needle just a be getting dark breeze fell very light although stitch of canvas be put on be still mile east of portland when morning broke a sun rose wind freshened bit moved faster through water hand be mustered divided into two watch jersey red cap served out to new hand have better give whole of duck trouser to fit from captain frank said there be assorted size know when have suited can take other ten pair into store mate will want when get into warmer climate be bound for mediterranean hawkins asked to gibraltar to begin with what will do afterwards will depend upon what news get there may have to go round world for know well sir hope not for sake young lady a far a be concerned must a lief go round world a anything else though be not very big craft for such journey a how long will water tank hold out be where pinch will come in sir reckon at ordinary time might make shift to go on for three week without filling up see have twenty hand instead of ten will make difference did get ten good sized cask yesterday morning got filled a well a tank be stowed away forward wo improve speed have brought head down over two inch of course will use water in first have better bring amidships captain stow round saloon skylight appearance be of consequence great thing be to get in best sailing trim if bad weather come on must put half in bow half in stern where can wedge in tightly together must not do to risk having rolling about deck well then went on seeing that captain did not like thought of having weight at end of yacht if weather get bad will take saloon skylight off lower down into can eat meal on deck in stateroom water must keep if get spell of head wind calm may be three week getting to gib must be very good plan sir if can do without saloon mind being littered up well hope sha get bad weather until get well across bay hawkins mind discomfort must stop speed want wind will just let carry canvas can travel deal faster so than can in heavy weather when might be obliged to get down greater part of canvas perhaps to lie to look like strong crew doe went on a glanced forward that doe sir craft of size can do well with more when be racing for crew be more than one want good deal people must stare if went into english port still say that be not advantage to be strong handed if get heavy weather make light work of getting up sail shifting one want to shift pretty often when be trying to get high speed out of craft wind continued fitful in spite of having racing sail osprey run to start be long one be not until thirty six hour after getting up anchor that be abreast of lighthouse try to be patient george mallett said be enough to make saint swear have lost eight ten hour instead of making gain although have advantage of coming through needle passage while have to go round at back of island to escape observation yes sir know have often found that sometimes one sometimes make gain in shifty wind perhaps tomorrow may be running along fast phantom be lying without breath of wind be so george will try to bear in mind there see skipper be taking exact bearing of lighthouse will soon be heading south in five minute captain gave order to helmsman craft be then laid on new course wind be northing bit skipper said a after giving helmsman instruction came up to frank have shifted two point round in last half hour see have got boom off bit if go round point more will get square sail ready for hoisting will help along rarely when head sail cease to be of good half hour later wind have gone round far enough for square sail to be used to advantage be accordingly hoisted captain then have barrel brought aft ranged along side of bulwark for eight forty hour osprey maintained speed leaving sailing vessel overtook far behind keeping for hour abreast of cargo steamer going in same direction be bound for finisterre skipper said will pas thirty mile to west so course will gradually draw apart will see smoke anyhow until be pretty nigh abreast of cape be if wind hold a be now be falling lighter afternoon two three hour later wind died away altogether square sail be got down skipper then said will get topsail down too sir can easily get up again will put smaller jib on at think by look of sky that be going to have blow glass must have altered more if be one never can tell must not risk loss of spar for anything must think that might put couple of reef in mainsail hawkins well perhaps must be best sir for puff one think nothing of one way other when craft have way will take over wonderfully when catch becalmed just a have finished dinner captain came down asked frank to come on deck there be steamer bearing down on can see side light a be coming in from west may not notice starboard light be burning all right one never can see green light be deceivingest thing at distance have just sent down for man to bring up riding light a be first rate one if put on deck will light up mainsail have told to bring up big horn ought to waken if anything will how far be off now hawkins about mile half major there be sign of altering course a ought to have done by time if have made out see head light show up fair square between side light show that be coming a near a possible on to think that have better light blue light frank nodded blue light at once blazed out ought to see that if be not asleep frank said a looked up at sail standing out white against dark sky set to work with foghorn skipper said man began to work bellow of great foghorn uttered roar might have be heard on still night many mile away again again roar broke out that have fetched captain said be starboarding helm to go astern of there have lost red light so be all right how must have liked to have be behind lookout officer of watch with marlinespike capstan bar will warrant that must not have nodded when on watch again for long time to come here come be closer than thought be will pas within fifty yard of stern be lucky that have big horn major mallett for if have not woke up when did must have run down to certainty a steamer came along scarcely more than length astern of yacht yell of execration broke from sailor gathered forward be near shave george frank mallett said when steamer have passed brought out in cold sweat at thought if osprey be to be run down there be end to chance of rescuing bertha from scoundrel clutch know that thought of at be good swimmer suppose must have stopped to pick up be osprey be thinking of even if life on board have be saved see how must have followed up search without chapter three hour later breeze came frank be pacing up down deck when there be slight creak above stopped looked up be that breeze asked first mate whose watch be think so sir though may be just heaving from steamer somewhere feel wind not breath from quarter there be more decided sound above there be mistake time mate said a boom have be hanging amidships slowly swung over to port be somewhere about quarter that expected from coming a gently a lamb five minute later there be sufficient breeze to cause to heel over perceptibly a moved quietly through water hand aft to shake out reef mate called order be repeated down fo'castle hatch by one of two men on lookout rest of watch who have be allowed to go below tumbled up sailor hastened to untie reef point be aware of nature of chase in be embarked whole crew be full of ardour felt a personal grievance that young lady to whom employer be engaged have not only be carried off carried off from deck of yacht moreover be very popular with a have often asked question chatted with when at helm when walked forward knew by name have several time come off from shore with packet of tobacco for man in basket have be quick in learning to steer desire to know everything about yacht have pleased sailor who be delighted when learned of engagement to owner new hand on learning particular have naturally entered to extent into feeling of others alacrity with order be obeyed showed interest felt in chase a soon a reef point be untied came order slack away reef tackle see that caring will run easy now up with throat halliard will do now gaff little more belay there now get that topsail up from sail locker wo shift jib just yet until see whether breeze be going to freshen be not long before increasing heel of craft rustle of water along side told that be travelling faster wind be freeing bit sir have shifted good half point in last ten minute be comfort frank said may a well heave log must like to know how be going before turn in seven knot sir mate reported be pretty fair considering how close hauled be well will turn in now let know if there be change at five o'clock frank be on deck again purvis be in charge of watch now good morning sir said touching hat a frank came up be going to have fine day wind be likely to keep steady right purvis what speed be going when heaved log seven half sir perry tell that have be doing just that ever since wind sprang up reckon that be pretty well abreast of finisterre now will have sun up in few minute expect that will come up behind land lambert go up to cross tree keep sharp lookout a sun come up see if can make land can make out land sir sailor called down a soon a reached cross tree stand well up must say that can see from deck mate frank walked further aft looked out under boom land be plainly visible against glow of sky there be sure enough mate said looked over there before came up must not make out sky have brightened lot in last ten minute must say that be about five twenty mile away be very bold coast sir be finisterre over quarter see land break off suddenly there ought to have made out light of course be not very bright at distance there be slight mist on water when came up at eight bell suppose in forty eight hour will not be far from southern point of portugal will be there thereabouts by time if wind keep same strength in same quarter must make uncommonly good run of considering that be lying twenty four hour becalmed if have not be for must have be only four day from start to saint vincent mate calculation turned out correct at seven in morning anchored mile off cape saint vincent gig be lowered frank be rowed ashore taking with signal book in question be given in several language including spanish have purchased at cowes before starting signal officer be very polite fortunately understood little english so frank managed with aid of book to make understand question craft at answering to description have be noticed passing during last five six day certainly yacht have passed might of course have gone by after dark showed frank record of ship have be sighted going east of have made number a passed phantom be not among latter did rig approximate tonnage a guessed of of others at correspond with hers after thanking officer frank returned to boat hour later osprey be again under weigh at ceuta tarifa tangier there be similar want of success craft might have passed if so be either too far away to be noted have passed during night from tangier crossed to gibraltar anchored among shipping there so far everything have gone to confirm theory that phantom must not go up mediterranean of course might have passed three place a well a saint vincent at night have kept so nearly in middle of strait a to pas without being remarked still chance be against regarded a almost certain that must have put into one other of african port a passed for water fresh meat fruit be six day after osprey passed saint vincent before anchored off gib have made number a came in in short time health officer came out in boat visit be formal one white ensign on taffrail be in sufficient to show character that must have come straight from england question asked be few brief be ten day out frank said have touched at tarifa ceuta tangier be crew be in good health here be list of if wish to examine a matter of formality be better that must be done health officer said will order to muster frank said while be doing so will come below take glass of wine can tell if craft about size schooner brigantine have put in here during last fortnight know whether be still flying yacht colour have gone into trade at rate must see at once that have be yacht certainly such craft have put in here major mallett yours be first yacht have come round season a board vessel that anchor here must certainly have noticed trader have formerly be yacht deck fitting must tell story at once do know name know much about frank said craft of kind sailed from cowes day two before started a believe for mediterranean being about own size heavily sparred for schooner be rather curious to know if have beaten did not make out a came along must have passed in night must say unless a be likely enough did not put in kept eastward a frank have touched at gibraltar three time before place have novelty for however went ashore at once to make arrangement for filling up again with water steward george lechmere accompanied into town to purchase fresh meat fruit vegetable frank then made way to post office be scarcely disappointed at finding that there be nothing for a yet next three day spent in wandering restlessly over rock a long a osprey be under weigh doing best be able to curb anxiety impatience now that be at anchor felt absolutely unable to remain quietly on board several officer of acquaintance came off to osprey be invited to dine at mess dinner night however declined fact be dear fellow said to be at present waiting with extreme anxiety for news of most important nature until get be so restless so confoundedly irritable that be not fit to associate with anyone when look in here again hope that will be right then will be delighted to come to have chat over indian day at present really be not up to appearance be sufficient to testify that plea be not fictitious excuse on fourth day found letter awaiting at post office tore open read funchal madeira august sir at request of mr greenwood beg to inform that brigantine precisely answering to description given anchored in road here on st only remained few hour to take in water store be at landing place when master came on shore said that have have wonderfully fast voyage from england having come from lizard under seven day holding leading wind way be flying belgian flag learned from portuguese official who visited that paper be in order that have be purchased at ostend from englishman only three week before have be named dragon did not remember what english name have be most unfortunately have left few hour before mail steamer came in bringing letter from lloyd know must in case have stopped think must have got official to have searched if lady have be on board have appealed to for protection think vessel must certainly have be detained at rate authority must have insisted upon lady being set on shore paper have cape a destination though may of course have be only blind regret much that be unable to give further information beyond fact that there be two male passenger on board will be happy to reply to communication may receive from frank hurried down to landing place lay out men said want to be under way in quarter of hour men bent to oar gig flew through water there be one on shore for frank have given strict order one be to land of morning until returned from post office get under way at once called to captain a soon a came within hailing distance there be instant stir on board of men ran to capstan others began to unlace sail cover while gathered at davit to hoist boat up directly came alongside have news lad frank said in loud voice a stepped on board have touched at madeira there be cheer from men be something to know that clue have be obtained in wonderfully short time osprey be under way heading for point of bay then did not stop there major george lechmere asked after frank have stated news no mail did not arrive with letter in time for lloyd agent to act upon phantom have sailed hour before be still under square yard name have be changed to dragon be there on st letter be dated th today be th george said so have fifteen day start of besides distance to madeira yes must be among west indie long before can hope to overtake there at south american port then have learnt for certain that have gone way major be not quite certain have doubt about paper say that be bound for cape be quite enough to show that be not going there think be west indie rather than south america for if went to brazilian port monte video buenos ayres must be much more likely to attract attention than must in west indie where there be score of island place where must cruise lie hidden a long a liked yes have doubt be destination be nasty place to have to search sooner later ought to be able to find fortunately negro pretty nearly speak english spanish french will have difficulty in getting information wherever there be information to be have four day later osprey anchored off funchal dinghy at once put off with six water cask frank be rowed ashore in gig have talk with correspondent latter however must give more information than have be contained in letter except that white streak have be painted out that craft carried fourteen hand of whom be foreigner must give information a to whether must be likely to touch at canary cape de verde island be inclined to think that must not took very large stock of water on board said much larger amount of meat vegetable fruit than must have required have intended to put in there meat be good deal dearer here than must be at saint vincent even teneriffe must think from that have intention of putting in there though might touch at saint helena ascension if be really on way to cape after what tell must think that idea that have made for west indie be correct one must say that be likely to lie up in quiet sheltered spot there for be hurricane season now one must be cruising about among island if must help there be score of place where must lie in shelter one be wiser except perhaps negro villager on shore yes must think be what must do frank agreed how long doe hurricane season last worst time be between middle of september middle of november can not depend upon settled weather until new year begin well hurricane hurricane will set out on search a soon a get over there two hour later osprey be again on way breeze be fresh steady with square sail set mizzen furled ran along at over nine knot hour one day succeeded without there being least occasion to make shift in canvas be not until be within day sail of porto rico that wind dropped almost suddenly purvis at once ran below glass have fallen long way since looked at at breakfast said a returned then be in for blow skipper said be new to latitude wherever be know what to do when there be sudden lull in wind heavy fall in glass now lad get canvas off down captain stitch andrew do two others get down into sail locker bring up storm jib small foresail trysail storm mizzen if be tornado sha want to show much sail to if be going to have tornado captain must recommend that get mainsail loose from hoop put cover on roll up tightly to gaff lash to bulwark on one side get boom off lash on other side will be very good plan lower get weight better when be done topmast be also sent down lashed by sail barrel be now empty be lowered down into saloon while trysail be fastened to hoop ready for hoisting reef tied up triangular mizzen be then hoisted storm jib wo get up foresail at present captain said have reefed right down sir wo hoist until have got first blow over have better see that everything be well secured on deck if be must put jib in stop can break out when like from account first burst of tornado be terrible must leave mizzen on will bring head up to way come will lie to under jib yes sir be likely enough that will have to sail have be reading about tornado picked up book at cowes day sailed when saw that be ordering chart of sea have learnt what be proper thing to do wind be from southeast at present mean that centre of hurricane lie to southwest if wind come more from east a long a can sail be to head northwest else lie to on port tack if shift more to south be to lie to on starboard tack that sound right hawkins be very easy to describe what ought to be done be not so easy to do when be in gale be almost strong enough to take mast out of will tell must do must break up couple of cask nail stave over skylight then nail tarpaulin over have fear whatever about weathering gale expect that for bit will be more under water than above see perry be getting two anchor below will help to ease at rate will be in good fighting trim think began none too soon there be thick mist over sky look a dark a pitch ahead there be only one thing more sir captain shouted hand get boat on deck see that be lashed firmly will see to getting in davit out of socket purvis getting below ought to have done before went on apologetically did not think of however with strong crew wo take five minute have got that something to spare think have got bowsprit reefed hawkins yes sir full reefed there be only one thing more can suggest fancy that tornado begin with heavy lightning get wire topmast stay twist tightly round shroud lash there leaving end to drop fathom two in water in way think that need be afraid of lightning if strike will run down wire shroud then straight into water in five minute be in readiness boat securely lashed on deck davit down below lightning protector tied tightly to wire shroud now captain think have done that can do what be doing now be running life line right round sir may save more than one life if sea make sweep of be right captain eighteen inch bulwark be great protection four sailor speedily lashed three inch rope four foot above deck from forestay round shroud aft to mizzen hove a tight a must get then fastened while be being done one of mate cut up piece of two inch rope into several foot length gave one to of men officer including frank george lechmere if tie middle of round chest under arm will have two end ready to lash to windward when get bad couple of twist round anything will keep safe however much water may come over do mean to stay on deck sir skipper asked wo be able to do good fewer hand there be on deck le there will be to be anxious about will only keep four hand forward after first burst be over will be lashed to shroud purvis will be there with perry andrew will take helm will stay with have battened fore hatch down one of men will be in after cabin if want to hoist trysail make change will give three knock will be signal for to send dozen hand up will come through saloon up companion sha be able to open fore hatch very well skipper will go down when hand do be going to have soon be now indeed so dark that must scarcely see face of man be speaking to really think captain must send of down below at once if flash of lightning be to strike mast must probably go down shroud harmlessly might do frightful damage among men crowded a be up here might blind of besides weight forward be trifle think that be right sir raising voice captain shouted hand below except four men told off go down by companion must mind stopping in saloon sir must make more lively than if went down into fo'castle certainly not captain accordingly men be ordered to remain in saloon can light pipe there lad frank said a went down make yourselves a comfortable a can last man have scarcely disappeared when captain said look there major mallett looking up frank saw ball of phosphorescent light eighteen inch in diameter upon masthead plenty of electricity about said cheerfully if be a harmless a that wo hurt a ceased speaking there be crash of thunder overhead made whole vessel quiver at same instant flash of lightning so vivid that for minute two frank felt absolutely blinded without moment intermission flash followed flash while crash of thunder be incessant think that plan of yours have saved ship sir captain said when after five minute lightning ceased a suddenly a have begun be sure that score of flash struck mast yet damage have be done to so far a must see by last flash be right there purvis right mate replied scared bit fancy know be none worse for be coming now sir captain said listen frank must hear low moaning noise rapidly growing louder then saw white line on water coming along with extraordinary velocity hard down with helm perry captain said hard down be sir hold on captain shouted few second later gale struck yacht shook a if in collision heeled over till water be half up deck then weight of lead ballast told a pressure on mizzen did work gradually came up to wind getting on to almost even keel a did so break out jib haul in weather sheet captain shouted purvis be expecting although did not hear word above howl of storm at once obeyed order there be sir lying to like duck skipper shouted in frank ear none worse for ordinary craft must have turned turtle have seen a far over when have be racing well will go below now hawkins frank shouted back be enough to blow hair off one head come down george with can be of use here chapter for eight hour osprey struggled with storm sea swept over deck dinghy be smashed into fragment yacht rode with far greater ease than ordinary vessel must have done a save for bare mast wind have hold upon there be spar with weight of furled sail to catch wind hold down be in perfect trim sharp bow met wave like wedge suffered to glide past with scarce shock while added buoyancy gained by reefing bowsprit getting anchor below lifted over sea a approached seemed a if must make clean sweep over from time to time frank went up for few minute lashing to runner to windward three men at helm be sitting up lashed to cleat sheltering a far a must by bulwark movement toward be impossible beyond wave of hand communication must be held frank must not have ventured out have not before going down below for first time stretched rope across deck in front of companion so that before going out obtained firm grasp of be by assistance able to reach side safely time went out four of crew from below followed relieved lashed to shroud forward skipper be carrying out plan have decided on foresail be hoisted few foot osprey by aid gradually edging way out from centre of tornado hand a came down received stiff glass of grog be told to turn in at once two hour after storm broke purvis came down for few minute be doing splendidly sir said must not have believed if have not seen that craft of size must have gone through sea a shipped so little water have have few big 'uns come on board in general go over like duck be hard work forward have got to keep back to for can hardly get breath if face if be not for lashing must blow right away have be at sea in gale that thought be big one nothing like of course with heavy ballast bare pole lie over much be sea not wind affect low free board be in favour believe ship with high side yard top hamper must be blown down on beam end kept there do think that blow a hard a did purvis there ai much difference sir do think there ai quite so much weight in expect be working way out of have be twice round compass be lucky have not got down among island before caught must not give much for chance if have be there for gale gradually wear out a get farther from island in six hour weather have so far moderated that be able to hoist reefed foresail two hour later trysail be set with reef in be shaken out in short time wind dying away fast crew have turned into hammock time before regular watch be now set motion of ship however be very violent for there be heavy tumbling sea still on wave having general direction tossing in confused mass coming on to deck now on one side now on other at midnight frank also turned in in clothes be soon up again for motion of yacht be so violent that found next to impossible to keep from being jerked out of berth first mate have have four hour off duty have just come up again to relieve captain be lucky sir that gear be nearly new said for if have not be rolling must have taken mast out of strain on shroud time that get chucked over must be tremendous must have be better for sort of work if have have ten foot taken off stick before started well just for present must have be better sir even if have have time must not have done must not have much chance of overhauling phantom if clipped wing in two hour sea have sensibly moderated frank again went down time be able to go to sleep when went on deck sun be way up mainsail be set reef have be shaken out be change for better captain be indeed sir think that have reason to be proud of craft have gone through tornado without having suffered slightest damage except loss of dinghy will be getting topmast up in hour see have got number two jib on shifted mizzen be still bit too lively to make safe to get up spar like a not if did must snap off before must get stay taut be terribly anxious about phantom frank said only trust that be in snug harbour on lee side of one of island hope so sir be thinking of lot of time when gale be at height if be a say in good port must be right enough of course if be out must run for nearest shelter if have more wind than have before came on have not much chance of doing that be true enough sir see glass gave notice three hour before caught besides certainly took native pilot on board a soon a got out here must have got into safe place at first sign of gale yes must certainly have have pilot on board frank agreed there be ground to hope that be snugly at anchor be three week ahead of must know that be hurricane season a well a do be likely that first thing did on arrival be to search for quiet spot where must lie up safely till bad season be over late on following afternoon land be seen ahead there be porto rico sir may not be quite nearest point to make there be island lying outside so that be safer to make for than for place where island seemed to be a thick a pea yes for same reason be likely that carthew made for of course naturally must have gone for barbadoes antigua barbuda most northern of leeward island must not do so if intends to keep belgian colour flying indeed must seem curious that two english gentleman must be cruising about in belgian trader may take that be certain to put into port for water vegetable just a have to do there seem to be at least dozen on side of island may have gone into of must be most likely to choose small place however at one other of be likely to get news first thing for to do be to get good black pilot who can talk english a well a spanish be likely will have to take three four of before have done man here might know virgin island perhaps most of leeward island might not know anything east west north of san domingo must certainly want pilot for bahamas third for cuba island round can be counted almost by hundred then again none of must know island fringing almost whole of coast from honduras to trinidad however hope will not have to search there be ample cruising ground number of hiding place without having to go so far out of world a at rate at present be not likely to have gone far think that will either have sought secluded shelter among virgin island on coast of san domingo when within few mile of porto rico lay to for night next morning coasted westward dropped anchor in port of san juan de porto rico quarter of hour after dropping port official came on board inspection of ship paper be short formality white ensign general appearance of craft showing at once to be english yacht a have only touched at madeira on way from gibraltar on board be in good health be at once given pratique first thing to do be to get interpreter frank said a be rowed to shore accompanied by george lechmere secretary of lloyd gave list of agent over world be spanish firm here be probable that none of speaks english if so have doubt that by aid of signal book will be able to make understand what want have circular letter of introduction from lloyd secretary have difficulty in discovering place of business of senor juan cordovo on sending in card letter of introduction be at once shown into inner office be received with grave courtesy by merchant who on learning that did not speak spanish touched bell on table clerk entered to whom spoke few word young man then turned to frank said speak english sir senor cordovo wish to assure that have be at disposal that will be happy to assist in way that may point out please assure senor cordovo of high consideration gratitude for offer will inform intend to cruise for time among island desire to obtain service of interpreter speaking english spanish if posse knowledge of french so much better reply be translated to merchant who conversed with interpreter for two three minute latter then turned to frank have brother senor who like speaks three language be at present out of employment must be sure be very glad to engage to a interpreter must be very thing frank said doe live in town yes senor must fetch here in few minute if senor cordovo will permit to do so merchant at once granted clerk request will tell senor cordovo frank said that wish to occupy valuable time will return here in quarter of hour merchant however through clerk assured frank that must not hear of leaving producing box of cigar begged to seat until arrival of interpreter then said something else to clerk latter asked frank if wanted supply for yacht a employer acted a agent for shipping certainly frank said glad to have opportunity of repaying civility shown require fresh meat fruit vegetable sufficient for twenty five person will also be glad if will arrange for boat to take off water barrel tank be nearly empty will want supply of about thousand gallon while clerk be absent frank with assistance of signal book kept up somewhat disjointed conversation with spaniard clerk be however away few minute returned with brother intelligent looking young fellow of seventeen eighteen did not speak english quite a well a clerk sufficiently well for purpose frank asked term seemed to ridiculously low bargain be forthwith arranged will ask senor cordovo if other english yacht have be here during past three week month have friend on board one fancy that be cruising out here also merchant replied that english yacht have touched at port for month such visit be extremely rare assured that store ordered must be alongside in course of afternoon expressed regret when frank declined invitation to stay with for day two at country house after renewed thanks frank took departure with new interpreter whose name be pedro george lechmere be waiting at corner of street have arranged everything satisfactorily george young man be coming with a interpreter a speaks french spanish will get on well in future when will be ready to come on board pedro in hour senor will find boat at quay take thing down to be white boat with british flag at stern want to go off yet have two thing want to do before go in first place want pilot want one who know virgin island well also coast of san domingo there will be difficulty about senor in second place want to find out from boatman at quay whether belgian schooner of seventy eighty ton have touched here during last month carry large yard on foremast be very fast looking craft be at one time english yacht if called here wish to know whether sailed east west if possible to obtain idea a to destination there be such vessel here senor for noticed only remained few hour while boat took off water vegetable happened to notice for having nothing to do be down at quay boatman be talking about being craft such a be seldom seen now of old men said that reminded of privateer in great war went down to boat when first came ashore men only spoke french paid dollar to go round with to make purchase took also water off in own boat surprised for be very handsome boat much more handsome than have seen in ship that ever came here said that must cost very small sum to send barrel off in native boat insisted upon taking know way sailed because went home a soon a went away from quay boatman will be able to tell went away talked with of negro boatman soon returned saying that sailed westward at what time did sail be just getting dark senor for said that must scarcely make out certainly went west well have to do now pedro be to hire pilot get best man that can find want one who know foot of virgin island be going there first doe not matter so much about knowing san domingo for a will probably come back here can put ashore get pilot specially for san domingo be sure get best man that can find term be will be back again here in hour be satisfactory indeed george frank went on a turned away of course strongly a believed that might be here there be absolute certainty about for might have gone to south american port even have headed for gulf of florida see be not only here came to very island thought that must most likely make for a for going west doubt be merely ruse did not get up anchor until be getting so dark that must be able in course of hour to change course make for virgin island without fear of being observed suppose that have idea whatever of being followed take precaution in power to cover up trace noticed of course anxiety that shore boat must go off to well george have succeeded so well thus far that feel confident that will overhaul before long a far a one can see on chart most of virgin island be mere rock number will have to search will not be very great if pilot really know business ought to be able to take to inlet where must be likely to anchor pedro be awaiting when returned to boat be accompanied by big negro who by grin on good natured face be evidently highly satisfied with bargain that have made be man senor pedro said met one of port officer know told that be considered to be best pilot in island speaks little english most of pilot do for several of virgin island belong to people of course when go down to windward island windward island frank repeated why be not anywhere near here must have said leeward island senor english call so dane dutch call windward island oh understand what be name man dominique sar talk english bery well take to port want to go know de rock shoal bery plenty dey be dominique know ebery one of dem be right be just man want be ready to go on board at once ready in hour sar go home now say goodbye to wife piccaninny pedro just tell that boat go off with water in one two hour dominique go off with like five dollar to give wife to buy ting while be away right dominique here be now miss boat will quarrel at starting will send ashore at once engage someone else dominique come sar that for sure good man always keep promise well here be couple of dollar dominique be present give that to wife tell to buy something for piccaninny with so saying frank george lechmere pedro stepped on board boat while pilot walked off black face beaming with satisfaction came off duly with last water boat while content of barrel be being transferred to tank for now that long run be accomplished there be longer necessity for carrying greater supply than must hold frank have talk with now dominique be know yacht cruising about on pleasure yes sar know dat at same time frank went on have object in view just at present want to find schooner brigantine put in here nearly month ago carried heavy spread of canvas on yard lay very low in water pilot nodded remember sar must not make out de craft people said pirate dar ai pirate now be so dominique still there may be reason sometimes for wanting to overhaul vessel have reason what be be of consequence pedro tell that when got under sail went west a be just dark when sailed may very well have turned a soon a be hidden from sight have gone east seems to likely that must in first place have made for one of virgin island depends sar upon trade that wanted to much trade dere sar trade be done at tortola dat english island at saint thomas santa cruz dem danish island de oder do little trade yes dominique think that want to trade at what want to do be to lie up quietly where must not be noticed plenty of place in island for dat sar did take pilot here dominique shook head sar several offer take if want to hide want pilot from here take up fisherman among island to show dem good place plenty of place much better in san domingo cuba why dey stop virgin island little place many got water food no noting bare rock think that must go in there because a hurricane season have begun when got here must think better to run into port hurricane not bad here sar bery bad down at what english call leeward island have dem sometimes here not bery often have one four day ago one ob de worse remember not likely to have dis year be satisfactory dominique got caught in other day want to meet well understand what want to begin with to search place vessel did not want to attract notice must be likely to lie up in want to question people a to whether have be seen if find to hear whether when last seen be sailing in direction of leeward island going west find out sar negro said confidently someone sure to have seen well have better come below have got chart will mark island where there be bay that must be likely to take shelter in can then see order in have better take be little beyond dominique english pedro explained to at frank request went below with frank telling hawkins to weigh anchor a soon a tank be filled store be on board have before came off returned to senor cordovo paid for thing supplied going through island one by one dominique made cross against possessed harbour inlet must have to be examined tortola be least likely of place for to go frank said a be british island not many people dar sar most people in town de rest of island rock hill broken up many good harbour what be size dominique twelve mile long sar two mile wide well be not great deal to search if have to examine inch of coast how many people be there two three hundred white men dey live in de town most two three thousand black well will begin with others must think that in fortnight ought to be able to do next twelve day be occupied in fruitless search fishing boat be overhauled questioned frank pedro went ashore to group of hut only fact that learned be that schooner answering to description have be seen time before information respecting be however very vague for asserted that be sailing one way frank concluded that have cruised about for day before deciding where to lie up be at tortola that first gained useful information many vessel have during last six week entered one other of deep creek one of have laid up for nearly month in narrow inlet with one two negro hut on shore be undoubtedly phantom rather dragon for negro have noticed that name on stern have sailed on day after hurricane a learned from shore village at other point have gone west well be comfort to think that even if have sailed direct here from porto rico must not have caught frank said to george lechmere have left here two day before got there suppose have someone on board who have be in island before for certainly harbour be best in group doubt got fisherman to bring into creek well there be nothing to do to turn head west be forty eight hour sail to san domingo fancy that be likely that will have stopped there see on chart that there be numberless bay there must be fear of question being asked by black if find there must try cuba san domingo be by far most likely place for to choose for headquarters there be at least four biggish river must sail up beside score of smaller one must say that have better try south west first coast be great deal more indented there than be to north there seem to be number of creek bay must think that must be likely to make one of headquarters spend time cruising about although dominique professed thorough knowledge of coast of san domingo hayti frank must see that be not so absolutely certain a be of virgin island told to land at village a passed along bring fisherman off acquainted with water in locality dat be de safest way for sure sar dominique said dis chile know de coast bery well can pilot ship into town of san domingo oder port that ship go to must not say for certain where de rock shoal be along place where de ship neber go in three day later osprey after sailing along northern shore arrived at porto rico passing through mona channel between island san domingo dropped anchor in port of capital dominique went ashore with pedro spent hour in boarding coasting craft questioning negro whether have seen brigantine several of have noticed have be cruising off coast have put in at mouth of nieve at jaquemel on south coast of hayti heard of too in deep bay at west of island between cape dame marie la move have seen sailing one way have evidently be a frank have expected cruising about pedro put down date of time at have be seen negro be very vague a to time beyond fact that have seen about week before while in other case be nearer fortnight must ascertain nothing with certainty so far a must learn have only put into three port although coaster boarded came from twenty different locality fancy that be a expected frank said have one regular headquarters to return frequently may be very secluded spot may be up one of small river marked on chart there be score of between cape la move here doe not seem to have be seen a far east a of course have not put in here because there be eight ten foreign ship here now one of twenty river have plenty of water for vessel of draught for mile up fancy best chance will be to meet cruising worst of must be major george lechmere said that must know if sail a well a used to do must not catch before night came on if have seven eight mile start especially if have wind aft be just what be afraid of have doubt that must beat easily working to windward in present rig be by mean certain that must not run away from if be free if once recognised there be saying where might go to after have shaken off certainly must not stay in water question be how can disguise if took down mizzen dirtied rest of sail must not be much of disguise nothing yacht carry anything like a big mainsail a ours big jib foresail straight bowsprit must tell tale of course must fasten wooden batten along side stretch canvas over paint black so raise side three foot even then narrowness of hull seen end on a must be in comparison to height of mast spread of canvas must strike carthew at once must follow example sir make into brig dare say must get done in week might spoil sailing a soon a found that be in chase of must at once suspect that something be wrong must of thing be worst especially if found must be just a likely a not that have leg of believe most certain way of must be to search for in boat if be to paint gig black so that must not attract attention give coating of grey paint to oar hire black crew must coast along stop at village search bay row far enough up river to find village hut where must learn whether phantom have be in habit of going up there must take time of course might be good deal of time saved in long run must do great deal of sailing gig stand well up to canvas when crew be sitting in bottom must fit out with native rig from here to cape la move following indentation must be somewhere between five six hundred mile perhaps more than that breeze be regular with sail ought to make from forty to fifty mile day say forty so that in three week must thoroughly have searched coast even allowing for putting in three four time day to make inquiry yacht must follow keeping few mile astern at rate must not pas at night when anchor must have two head light one at crosstrees one at topmast head will be on lookout for will take blue light red light with night will burn blue light say at nine o'clock man in crosstrees will make out twenty mile away will tell where be want if burn red light will be signal for yacht to come pick up then will go in boat major yes must be doing something will take pedro with perhaps dominique can get pilot here dominique be shrewd fellow can get more out of negro than pedro can certainly will be best plan will avoid necessity of spoiling yacht speed may be of vital importance to at critical moment call dominique down will send ashore at once with pedro to get hold of good pilot four good negro boatman native sail think be want chapter a soon a dinghy with dominique pedro have left side of yacht captain by frank order set four men to work to paint gig black while others gave coat of dull lead colour to varnished oar order be received with much surprise by men who audibly expressed regret at seeing brightly varnished boat oar thus disfigured after about three hour on shore dinghy returned loaded with fruit vegetable pedro have purchased native mast sail former be at once cut so a to step in gig sail be hoisted be then taken in hand by one of crew who be fair sailmaker to be altered so a to stand flatter hour later new pilot four powerful negro came alongside in shore boat be now late in afternoon so start be postponed until next morning few other arrangement be made a to signalling be settled that if frank showed red light rocket must be sent up from yacht to show that signal have be observed that be getting up sail be to keep light up so that frank must make out a came up put off to meet george lechmere saw to preparation for victualling gig two large hamper of fresh provision be placed on board two four half gallon keg of water bundle of rug be placed in stern sheet boat flagstaff be fixed in place in stern yard of sail be at night to be lashed from mast to staff at height of four foot above gunwale across sail be to be thrown to act a tent kettle frying pan plate knife fork be put in forward box of signal light under seat aft canister of tea sugar coffee necessary have be stowed away in hamper together with plentiful supply of tobacco bag of twenty eight pound of flour wrapped up in tarpaulin be placed under one of thwart a soon a be daylight anchor be got up when yacht have sailed for seven eight mile to west gig be lowered four black boatman took place in frank took rudder line dominique sat near sail be then hoisted a wind be light boatman got out oar shot ahead of osprey directing course obliquely towards shore be not necessary to land at coast village here a be morally certain that phantom have not touched anywhere within twenty thirty mile of san domingo must hardly have entered of narrow river at night nevertheless did not pas of without rowing up when native hut be reached dominique closely questioned negro pilot have by time be informed of cause of search for phantom have until left san domingo be profound mystery to frank however being now fully convinced of negro trustworthiness of readiness to do in power to assist thought a well to confide in when be together in boat informed that brigantine be searching for have carried off young lady maid from england man must be rascal negro said angrily what do want dat lady for sar love bery much dominique what love be fortune be rich have gambled away fine property want money to set on leg again bery bad fellow dat pilot said shaking head earnestly ought to be hung dat chap dominique do can to help sar do more now for dat young lady find for suah tink there will be fighting sar think likely that will show fight when come up with see have very strong crew have arm for dat good wonder often why have so many men nothing for half of dem to do now understand well sar if there be fighting see fight gib cutlas fight like debil thank dominique frank said warmly though with difficulty repressing smile will count on if have to use force a far a be concerned own must prefer that did resist for must like nothing better than to stand face to face with villain of armed with cutlas if know here go up river get plenty of black men fight for black fellow bery foolish give little present fight have not thought of dominique yes if have made creek headquarters might a say get people to take side by giving present be if knew that be here however at present can not dream that be after if can come upon unawares will make short work of news be obtained of schooner until headland of la catarina be passed at large village of azua learned that have anchored for night in bay five day before have be seen to sail out certainly have not turned into river niova touching at village exploring inlet frank continued course until after rounding bold promontory of la beata reached bay at head of stand jaquemel two three day have communicated with osprey slept on board leaving at anchor with sail down until have gone ten mile in advance have at time be obliged to keep at distance from shore owing to danger from rock shoal pilot on board must have taken through frank be unwilling to encounter risk unless absolutely necessary at jaquemel learnt that schooner have put in there fortnight before there at point after leaving azua have be seen since time have sailed west next night after looking in at bainette twenty mile beyond jaquemel frank rejoined osprey gig be hoisted up sailed round point of gravois coast intervening being so rocky dangerous that although there be passage through shoal to town of st louis frank felt certain that schooner must not be in there coast from here to cape dame marie be high precipitous with indentation where ship must lie concealed voyage be continued in yacht a far a cape be now at entrance of great bay of hayti take a pretty certain frank said a george lechmere skipper dominique bent over chart that schooner be somewhere in bay have certainly not made headquarters anywhere along south coast in first place have seldom be seen in second have examined thoroughly therefore take that be somewhere here unless of course have sailed for cuba see why must have done that coast there be good deal more dangerous than of san domingo must not want better place for cruising about than bay see be about ninety mile across mouth over hundred to port au prince with indentation harbour round with island of genarve forty mile long to run behind in centre must get everything want at port au prince at petit gouve look good sized place must say in first place that must not do better than run down at night to island of genarve anchor close under from there will see if come out of port au prince petit gouve side may take by getting on to elevated spot have view of pretty nearly whole bay looking at at present two most likely spot for to make headquarters be in very sheltered inlet behind point of halle on north side in equally sheltered bay inlet under bec de marsouin on south from genarve ought to be able to see coming out of of be not above five twenty mile from island to bec de marsouin forty to point of halle might not see come out from there must soon make out if be coming down from port au prince be agreed that be best plan to adopt might lead to sighting schooner in day two while to row round bay search inlet in must take fortnight from genarve too forty mile sail in gig must take into port au prince brigantine might possibly have made headquarters accordingly after waiting until nightfall got up sail anchored at six in morning in small bay in island of genarve here must not be likely to attract notice of ship passing up to port au prince unless be very unlikely one came along close to shore a soon a anchor be dropped boat rowed to shore frank george lechmere pedro four sailor with basket of provision started at once for highest point in island four mile distant dominique went along shore with two sailor to make inquiry at village came to on reaching top of hill frank saw that a have expected commanded extensive view over bay on side of island be six mile across village must be seen on northern shore three mile distant to pedro with one of sailor be at once despatched party rejoined frank soon after midday schooner have be noticed passing island several time much more often on southern side than on northern negro on side be agreed that generally kept on southern side of passage that more than once have be seen coming from south shore passing western point of island on way north look a if came from petit gouve bay of mitaquane that under bec de marsouin frank said dat be sar dominique agreed if want to go north side of bay from port au prince must have gone side of island expect lie under de bec fine safe place dat town there plenty of wood round village where get fruit vegetable sure to be little stream where can get water watch be maintained until sunset although powerful telescope have be brought up vessel at corresponding to appearance of brigantine be made out at six o'clock next morning frank be again at lookout scarcely have turned telescope to south shore than saw brigantine come out from behind bec de marsouin head towards west wind be blowing from quarter after few minute deliberation frank told men to follow dashed down hill in hour reached shore opposite yacht at shout dinghy be lying at stern at once rowed ashore get up anchor captain make sail have seen have just come out from bec be making west a wind be against seems to that must never choose direction to cruise in unless be starting for cuba dare not let opportunity slip if once get clear away may have month of work before find again a wind now be be sure that can overhaul long before can make cuba indeed a lie be nearer to coast than be can certainly cut off in five minute osprey be under way with sail set wind be nearly due west a cuba lay to north of point have advantage quite counter balanced that gained by start phantom have obtained in two hour lookout at head of mast shouted down that must perceive brigantine topsail be sailing in towards land on side said have evidently made tack out be now on starboard tack again will be long leg short one with sir skipper said think that if be in place must just manage to lay course along coast with square yard of hers can not go a close to wind a can a be can lay course to cut off must be rather close pinch to do so before get to head of bay frank said yes sir suppose that will overhaul before certainly sha be far behind by time get there think that will cut off if wind hold a doe now at rate if must get there first must certainly lie between cuba will have to run back to round cape to run east south wish wind must freshen fancy that be more likely to die away still be walking along well at present even frank anxious a be must not feel satisfied a looked at water glancing past side be heeling well over rustle of water at bow must be heard where be standing near tiller andrew best helmsman on board yacht held tiller rope perry be standing beside from time to time frank went up to crosstrees be drawing in upon fast said be travelling well too much better than must have thought must have done with rig think have got better wind than have have only made one short tack in for last two hour captain prognostication a to wind be verified to frank intense annoyance gradually died away headed so much that must no longer lie course what will do sir will hold across to south shore work along by a schooner be doing will go about at once go about at once hawkins see can see topsail from deck of course can see ours suppose have paid attention to yet if stand away on other tack will soon drop altogether while if hold on will when reach that shore be three four mile behind of course will have full view of sailed on port tack for hour then came round again brigantine must no longer be seen from deck must only just be made out from crosstrees think on tack skipper said a stood by compass after have gone round will make point think that will make ahead of think so too hawkins what pace be going now not much more than four knot sir only fear be that sha get near before be dark think that have plenty of time for sir see got up anchor at half past six be just twelve o'clock now five hour must take up to if wind hold at by two o'clock topsail of brigantine must be again made out from deck be still working along shore be on port bow three hour will be alongside of skipper said if be not mistaken will come out ahead of there be one advantage in course be taking hawkins viewing a will pretty nearly end on till get nearly abreast of wo be able to make out rig clearly by four o'clock be within five mile of brigantine wind then freshened laying course a did while brigantine be obliged to make frequent tack osprey ran down fast towards must have eye on by time captain said though can not be sure that be osprey can see that be yawl of over hundred ton a can not doubt that be chasing wo be long in guessing who be will get arm up sir yes may a well do so musket can be loaded laid by bulwark be not to be touched until give order doubt also be armed be anxious not to fire shot if can be helped once alongside be strong enough to overpower with cutlass only with five black be now double strength even carthew may see uselessness of offering resistance ran down until be within mile of shore not being now more than beam off brigantine two female figure have time before be made out on deck have now disappeared be evident that osprey be being closely watched by on board brigantine presently two three men be seen to run aft be going to tack again sir if do will come right out to frank made reply stood with glass fixed on brigantine suddenly exclaimed round with hawkins up with helm andrew hard up man skipper shouted a ran to slack out main sheet four men ran aft to assist will do said a fell off fast from wind now then gather in main sheet ready for jibe slack off starboard runner couple of hand aft get square sail out of locker mr purvis get yard across lower down ready for sail see that brace guy be right now in with sheet lad handsomely will do be over go slack out sheet steadily be round too frank said a boom went off nearly square have gained be not more than mile away manoeuvre have in fact brought yacht nearer to other have boom over to starboard quick with square sail frank shouted be drawing away from fast two minute later square sail be hoisted foot boomed out on port side eye be now fixed on brigantine to disappointment saw that be still though very much more slowly drawing ahead be just what feared frank said in tone of deep vexation with big yard be certain that must leave when running ahead before wind however there be fear of leaving what be doing now seven knot about sir be doing knot better what do think that will do now hawkins see what have got to do sir if be to get five mile ahead of then haul wind must know that must not go away from for must be to windward be evidently good bit faster than be when be close hauled only other thing can see for to do be to run straight on to port au prince at rate be going now must be in soon after daylight tomorrow must be seven eight mile astern of might think that must not venture to board there think that must rely on hawkins now that know who be will guess that will stick at nothing what be afraid of be that will lower boat row miss greendale maid ashore might do either there what must be much more likely row ashore to quiet place during night take friend two three of men with leave rest to sail to port au prince think that wind be going to hold skipper said looking astern reckon that will drop a generally doe at sunset be not blowing so hard now a did just before wore round in hour indeed fell so light that osprey be standing through water only at three half knot hour light wind suited phantom with great sail spread have now increased lead to mile half be evidently leaving fast there be only one thing to be done george must board in boat be ready major will be rather risky business frank looked at in surprise mean for sir george said with smile for miss greendale may be sure that fellow will fight hard a come up behind will get hot now sir if anything happens to must remember that osprey will be a good a useless towards helping a owner might be able to justify what be doing if be gone there must be one to take lead carthew must only have to sail into port au prince denounce a pirate hear from pilot that nigger have got armed ship might sink a soon a came into harbour then there must be end to chance of miss greendale getting liberty be true enough george think that must be risked now that know be here have nothing to do to send ashore under charge of friend two three of sailor take up into hill might go with be perhaps more likely then when came up with at port au prince skipper must simply deny that there have ever be lady on board must swear that have only carried out two gentleman passenger a paper must show might declare that have landed at porto rico of course be certain to fight now for can do so without risk a can swear that took for pirate how many do think that gig will carry hawkins well sir might put nine in brought ten off at southampton if remember put very low in water must run good deal heavier than party then yes think that have better take only nine if overload will row so heavily that will be long time overhauling be not quite sure that will overhaul anyhow sir look at cloud coming over hill be travelling fast must say that be likely to have squall doubt get here pretty often with such high land round well must chance that hawkins if one doe come must pick up a come along agree with doe look a if must have squall may not be anything very serious anyhow if come will take along great deal faster than can row purvis suppose that dinghy will carry seven yes will do easily very well can try will give sixteen of be about strength must remain on board purvis will command dinghy lechmere will go with pick out thirteen hand perry can manage with seven five negro keep sharp lookout for squall remember that will have very short warning be only mile from shore a be coming down from hill may not see on water until be quite close to boat be lowered men armed with musket cutlas took place frank george lechmere have cutlas revolver buckled to waist now give way lad frank said be about two mile ahead of ought to overtake in hour be now getting dusk light fading out suddenly a cloud spread over sky frank last order to skipper before leaving be edge in hawkins until be dead astern of brigantine then if squall come down before reach will be right in track have put lighted lantern into stern sheet of boat sir have thrown bit of sail cloth over so that if leaf behind hold up there wo be fear of missing men rowed hard gig have to stop frequently to let dinghy come up gained however fast upon brig in hour be few hundred yard astern then came hail from brigantine in french keep off will sink reply be made be two hundred yard away when there be two bright flash from stern of brigantine shower of bullet splashed round boat there be two three cry of pain george lechmere felt frank give sudden start be hit sir have got bullet in left shoulder george be of consequence row on lad shouted will be alongside before have time to load again never thought of having gun though went on a men recovered from surprise dashed on again with cheer by sharp crack must be brass suppose picked up couple of small gun at ostend thinking that might be useful to in water splattering fire of musketry now broke out from brigantine have lessened distance by half when saw brigantine without apparent cause heel over farther farther went until lee rail be under water firing instantly ceased there be loud shout on board then a came up into wind square yard be let fall crew ran up ratline to secure sail simultaneously foresail came down then head payed off again darted away like arrow from boat however have ceased rowing frank a saw brigantine bowing over have shouted to purvis to put boat head to wind doing same few second afterwards squall struck with such force that of oar be wrenched from hand of men who be unprepared for attack steady men steady frank shouted wo last long keep on rowing so a to hold boat where be till yacht come along wo be many minute before be here in little over quarter of hour be seen approaching frank saw that in spite of effort of men at oar boat have be blown distance to leeward however a soon a lantern be held up osprey altered course captain

that be just same here be not a if must do good on deck men be just a anxious to catch brigantine a be be hot enough before now that one of mate have be killed five six wounded believe that must go round world rather than let slip through hand will be up down night major captain mate will be up too promise will let know if there be anything to tell well will lie down george know that will get sleep still perhaps will be better for to keep arm quite quiet be already without coat for have be cut from neck down to wrist to enable george to get at wound kicked off light canvas shoe george helped to lie down in berth will be sure to let know if change course anything promise will come straight down major three quarter of hour later george stole noiselessly down peeped into stateroom have turned down swinging lamp before went up there be enough light to enable to see that master have fallen off to sleep took news up to hawkins who at once gave order that noise be to be made men still moved about deck went barefooted wind keep just same hawkins said ca make more than three half knot through water must give year pay if must go round dead ahead of must soon pick up then a be keep crawling away however can make out on night a good deal further than be likely to get before morning besides will be having moon up soon a be steering pretty nearly east will show up famously now

will bring couple of blanket up lie down aft promised major must let know if there be change in wind in brigantine course so wake directly there be anything to tell have put bell within reach have doubt will hear through open skylight if ring if not wake at once right trust for twice during night george got up went below first time frank have not moved second found that tumbler of lime juice water on table at side of bunk be nearly half emptied that master have again gone off to sleep be breathing quietly regularly be going on right said to hawkins when went up there be fever yet anyhow for have drunk only half that glass of lime juice if have be feverish must not have stopped until have got to bottom of when george next woke morning be breaking anything new asked purvis who be now at tiller nothing governor have not rung bell wind be just a be neither better worse brigantine be eight mile ahead of george went forward to have look at think have better wake said to will have have nine hour of wo like if let know that be daylight will get two three fresh lime squeezed then go in to time frank opened eye a entered morning be breaking major everything be a be hope that be feeling better for sleep let help up here be tumbler of fresh lime juice feel right enough george can scarcely believe that be morning how have slept fancied must not have gone off at drinking off lime juice frank at once followed lechmere on deck after word two with purvis hurried forward be long way ahead said with tone of disappointment mate reckoned between seven eight mile major how far be from bec know sir did not ask purvis frank went aft repeated question fancy that be bec furthermost point that can see purvis said reckon that be about halfway to keep point two out purvis line of shore be pretty straight beyond want of thing not to lose sight of for moment must give good deal to know what be going to do can not think that be going to try to go round southeast point of island for if be must have laid head way before osprey edged out until opened line of coast beyond headland then kept course again there be trifle more wind a sun rose higher yacht went fully knot faster through water in le than two hour brigantine be abreast of headland presently frank exclaimed be hauling in wind that be sir hawkins who have just come on deck exclaimed surely can not be going to run into bay can be going to hing else frank said what on earth doe mean by doubt that scoundrel be going to land with miss greendale why must leave phantom at mercy when must have sent on to port au prince can not think what be doing sir must have game on must never act like of course may have arranged to go with lady to place up in hill why must sacrifice yacht be rum start anyhow can not make head tail of of course will capture sir know hawkins be one thing to attack when have miss greendale on board if have gone ashore must be very like act of piracy yes sir then see fired into boat killed one of men wounded four five others be right enough hawkins can not deny that did in self defence of course know that must have recognised knew what errand be captain crew must be ready to swear that did that be convinced by action that be pirate at rate may be sure that black must retain craft that must be held prisoner for considerable time while miss greendale must be captive in hand of carthew must attack brigantine if knew to be on board must be justified in doing so even if cost dozen life to capture think must be justified in risking single life in attacking brigantine if be not on board to do so must in first place be distinct act of piracy in second if got possession of brigantine must have gained nothing by might burn sir yes might run risk of being hung for might take into port au prince have absolute evidence against must not swear that have positive knowledge that miss greendale be on board certain a be that female figure made out on deck be maid be very much too far away to recognise skipper might swear that be two negress to whom be giving passage moreover if took brigantine must only cut off carthew escape in direction power over miss greendale must be just a great if have up among mountain among black a be when have on board can see have made horrible mess of whole business be only thing can see yesterday thought be best thing to start on direct chase a seemed absolutely certain to that must overhaul capture now see that be worst thing must have done ought to have waited until must take in bay see major said george lechmere who be standing by if have gone on searching with boat before have made examination of whole bay there must be no knowing where have gone might have be month before must have got fairly on track again acted for best thing have turned out badly feel more hopelessly at sea a to what have better do next than have done since day got to ostend at rate there be nothing to be done until have got fair sight of brigantine seemed to on board that osprey have never sailed so sluggishly a did for next hour half a expected craft be to be seen on water of bay a rounded point dominique other pilot have be closely questioned asserted that at upper end of bay there be branch curved round like dat sar latter said half closing little finger progress up bay be so slow that boat be lowered yacht be towed to mouth of curved branch here be completely landlocked breeze died away altogether how long be bend jake frank asked second pilot in french two mile sir perhaps two mile half deep water everywhere plenty of water can anchor close to shore country boat run in here very often if bad weather come on foreign ship never come here always run on to town told that there be few hut at end yes sir there be village there two others near crew have armed musket be again placed ready for use have better go round hawkins frank said tell on account be shot to be fired unless give order tell men be just a anxious to fight a be that if give shadow of excuse will board went round among men hour ago sir told how land lay lechmere have be doing same want to fight have made see that might be very awkward business for men in boat be told to take easy be best part of hour before saw on turning last bend brigantine lying at little more than quarter of mile away look full of men frank exclaimed a turned glass upon yes sir said captain who be using powerful telescope be black there must be fifty of beside crew a far a can see most of be armed that explains why came in here hawkins have be using place for last three week doubt have made good friend with negro dare say carthew have spent money freely on well settle must attack at sea without hesitation however many black there might be on board to do so now must be height of folly five of men be certainly not fit for fighting so that strength in white be nearly equal to ours have got two little cannon must probably reduce number bit before got alongside with fifty black to help be very doubtful whether must be able to take by boarding certainly must not do so without very heavy loss will anchor about two hundred fifty yard outside a long a lie quiet there will leave alone if try to make off will board at once anchor with kedge will hold here have buoy on cable have ready to slip at moment notice sail ready to hoist easy rowing captain called to men in boat come alongside have plenty of way on to take up berth in two three minute anchor be dropped sail lowered now will row across to frank said tell want to attack be determined to search craft major george lechmere said firmly be not going to let throw away life have right to do at rate not until after miss greendale be rescued may be sure of one thing carthew have left order before going on shore that be to be shot if come within range will know that if be killed there will be end of trouble will go sir frank made answer for minute two then said in case must be shot instead of if carthew be on shore a feel sure be others wo know from agree with can not afford to risk life just now yet must search that brigantine go sar dominique who be standing by said suddenly take two black fellow in dinghy dey fire at go dere tell captain dat want to have to kill crew dat got to search dat craft if let search be made den harm come of if say den take yacht alongside kill man jack say dat white sailor furious because dey fire at yesterday want bad to have fight very well dominique can do harm anyhow a feel sure that lady have be taken ashore see why must refuse accordingly dominique called to two of negro boatman to get into dinghy took seat in stern when boat be halfway between two vessel there be hail in french what do want if come nearer will fire what want to fire for dominique shouted back pilot capture ship single handed want to speak to captain be evident answer be understood for reply came for minute two well come along then word must be heard perfectly on board yacht skipper talk english george thought that must do so carthew be sure to have shipped someone who must understand suppose french be better than mine dinghy be rowed to within ten yard of brigantine now what message have brought from pirate pirate at know dat bery well massa captain dat english yacht anyone see dat with eye de gentleman there say have lady on board dat have be carried off then be liar belgian said there be woman on board at well sar dat be matter ob opinion english gentleman tink dat hab say dat prove bery easy de gentleman say want to search ship if a say be here den ob course reason for to say to dat if on de other hand say den quite sure right come search whether like den der big fight bery strong crew on board dat yacht plenty gun men bery savage cause kill one of der fellow last night dey want to fight bad if dey come dey kill many what de use of dat sar why say wo let search if lady not here nothing to fight about if not let see not here den board de ship when take burn belgian stood for two three minute without answering have seen that there be two three twenty men on board osprey be by mean sure that be entire number there be three black there might be number of lying down behind bulwark kept below issue of fight seemed to doubtful be by mean sure that men must fight hard in cause in have personal interest a for black must not count for much in hand to hand fight with english sailor have received no order a to what to do in contingency presently turned to three of men said in french go to stern cabin see that there be nothing about must show that have be occupied have asked to search let come find nothing thing will go quietly if not say will attack kill man on board burn ship a know how many men may have on board a can do harm by looking round if there be nothing for to find have best let do mind order hold good if owner of troublesome craft come alongside be to pour in volley kill sailor with will make so many le to fight if come to fighting owner tell that if be once killed there will be end of then went to side said to dominique there be nothing for to find here be honest trader there be nothing worth pirate stealing in order to show that be speaking truth have objection to two hand coming on board going through have nothing to hide dominique rowed back to yacht dey will let be searched sar thought must frank said of course be sign that there be one there will go sir skipper said a agreed must give anything to get rid of might be met with volley when came alongside now there ai use in running risk if have be told what be like can not mistake for be pretty near foot taller be better than ten year younger have hair on face will go through be sure lady ai there must not let still will make sure there be hiding place in yacht where anyone must be stowed away of course be like chock full of ballast up to floor sha be many minute about sir dominique may a well go with can stay on deck while go below may pick up something from black fellow there may a well take hawkins may be very sure that wo give chance to speak to anyone captain stepped into boat be rowed to yacht dominique stepped on to deck be lost sight of among black in ten minute appeared at gangway again stepped into boat minute be alongside osprey of course found nothing hawkins nothing sir anything lady may have left behind have be stowed away in locker looked about to see if must sight bit of ribbon other woman fal lal have gone ever carefully two of other state cabin have be occupied there be men clothes hanging there of course looked into cupboard where a much a child must have be stowed away looked round forecastle anyhow there be woman there now dominique have to go round with captain evidently did not want to give chance of speaking to anyone mate two of sailor posted at gangway so that two black must not be able to talk to nigger on board now sir what be to be done next will go below talk over captain come down too george yes dominique may be useful now hawkins went on when have taken seat at table of course have be thinking over morning have come to conclusion that only chance now be to fight with own weapon a long a lie here there be chance whatever of miss greendale being brought on board again so chase now have got to be carried on on land if go to work right way there be reason why must not be able to trace propose to take lechmere dominique four black boatman if stain face little put on pair of duck trouser white shirt red sash broad straw hat bought at san domingo will look just like half caste planter saw in street there must take pedro too will want to translate anything have to say to jake propose that a soon a be dark tonight muffle oar of dinghy row away land lower down say mile so then make off up into hill before tomorrow morning dominique will try to find out something by inquiring at of hut of black be not likely to know if offer handsome reward to obtain news for will go down to village ferret out something people there must not be likely to know where have be taken must be able to point out direction in went on starting then must follow up inquire again might take couple of villager with belonging here must have more chance of getting news from other black than stranger must have think sir that must be a well to have four five men with hawkins said there be doubt fellow that be after be desperate chap may have got strong body of black a guard might suspect that after having pursued way might try to follow on land must put men in hiding somewhere day while be making inquiry must be mighty handy if came to fighting seems to be pretty sure to do before see lady off well perhaps must be best hawkins a say by keeping hid day see that must increase difficulty then see will want hand here for if brigantine sail whether by night day be to sail too to keep close to wherever go be not likely that carthew miss greendale will be on board may very well send order down to brigantine to get up anchor must know that must stick to a miss greendale might have be taken on board again at night in way must get rid of from here must calculate that must get tired of following brigantine in time that must be able to give slip must then make for place where must join again so order to will be to stick to not to interfere with in way unless by chance must discover that miss greendale be really on board in case authorise to board capture wo have black on board a be going on right three of anyhow will be able to lend hand in couple of day will be match for especially a will soon make up mind that mean to attack will get chance of running alongside taking by surprise well sir think that can do with four hand le than have now see there be nineteen two mate say two of wounded wo be able to lend hand make twenty to say nothing of jake pedro so even if took four hand must be pretty even in number if men must not whip two belgian have better give up sea yes have doubt that must do be not for carthew friend must not hesitate to take eight men know about other may be sure that carthew will fight hard be playing desperate game still think that might take four especially a think chance of miss greendale being brought on board until belief that have left water be very small very well then be settled five black lechmere four of sailor will make strong party serve musket cutlass out to black same with brace of pistol to of hand go with while be away let two of men dress up in white duck shirt jacket in white straw hat let always keep aft sit about in deck chair always go down below by main companion will make think that be still on board while if there be one on deck aft will soon guess that have landed understand that have be saying dominique understand sar tink bery good plan suah to find out way dat rascal hab gone plenty of black fellow glad to earn two dollar to guide dey money here two dollar big sum to right dominique wo stick at two dollar if be necessary must pay two hundred cheerfully for news find dem widout dat black said confidently not good offer too much if black man offered two dollar bery glad if offered twenty begin to say to 'dis bery good affair perhaps someone else give forty ' there be something in dominique anyhow will leave part of business to a rule will keep in hiding with boatman sailor day will be no good for asking question for know much french dialect negro of island speak be beyond altogether can not understand boatman at black men here bad sar not like dem in de other island here dey tink better than white men bery ignorant fellow sar most of dem lost religion go back to fetish bery bad dat sort of bad thing in dat affair kill child woman to make fetish bad people sar dey be worse here than at san domingo there be nothing to do day to sit on deck watch brigantine most of black have be landed only three four sailor remained on watch on deck frank george lechmere in broad straw hat sat smoked in deck chair former eye wandering over mountain a if in search of something might point out bertha hiding place hill be for most part covered with tree with here there little clearing patch of cultivated ground with two three hut in centre with glass solitary hut must be seen hidden by tree here there occasional little wreath of light smoke curling up showed that there be others entirely hidden in forest think major george lechmere said after long pause that must be good thing to have gig night at point agreed on such a spot where land see sir there be saying what may happen may have to make running fight of must be very handy to have boat to fall back upon yes think that good idea george will tell hawkins to send ashore say at ten o'clock night there be chance whatever of being down before that be sure to have taken long distance up hill though of course one can not say at present be pretty certain that will have to attack after dark be important that must land where there be sort of path noticed one two such place a came along may a well get into dinghy row down choose spot now of course will be watching from brigantine when see same number went come back again will suppose that have only gone for row perhaps to get shot at anything come across may a well take couple of gun with mile down inlet came upon just spot be searching for shore be level for few yard from water edge from here there be well marked path going up slope behind will fix upon spot george will be easy for boat to find in dark from big tree close to water edge now will paddle about for hour before go back hour later returned to yacht george began at once to make arrangement for landing chapter must keep watch watch regularly hawkins say that be likely be quite possible that may make attempt to surprise cut throat then sink osprey might attack with boat with lot of native craft at rate be worth while keeping crew always on deck be sure light cabin a usual must suspect be away if did not see saloon skylight lit up there be saying when may be back may be three night may be six for know may be longer than that may be sure that if get clue will follow up wherever lead strictest silence be maintained among men two men at oar be told to row very slowly above thing to avoid splashing boat be exceedingly low in water much too low for safety except in perfectly calm water a including two men at oar there be thirteen on board frank have thought however inadvisable to take dinghy also for be lying behind stern might have be noticed have pulled up to gangway gig have be purposely left on side hidden from brigantine a rowed away pain be taken to keep yacht in line with held on course indeed until be close in to shore then kept in under shelter until curve hid altogether be very careful a row back lad go very slowly ripple on smooth water might very well be noticed by even if must not make out boat ay ay sir will be careful have brought lantern with covered with canvas except for few inch in front take sar go first dominique said den if meet anyone stop quiet go on talk with frank followed dominique george keeping beside where there be room for two to walk abreast at other time falling just behind then came sailor four black boatman be in rear have be told that in case be halted heard dominique in conversation be to pas quietly through others be ready to join help if necessary with exception of dominique frank george lechmere carried musket pilot declined to take one neber fired off gun in life sar more afraid of gun than of dose rascal dominique fight with um sword dat plenty good for path mounted hill until be a frank thought three hundred foot above water here ground be cultivated after walking for ten minute saw two three light in front stop here sar dominique said handing lantern to frank go on see how best get round de village must not be seen here if native boat come in at night suah to go up to end ob water land at village dere negro soon returned said that cultivated land extended on side of village there be difficulty in crossing village be passed quietly when be once well behind came down upon path again be much larger better marked than have be before after following for mile came upon road led obliquely up from water ran somewhat inland be doubt road from village at head of arm of bay have probably come along here though may have turned more directly into hill be first point to find out dominique yes sar next village see go in wid two ob de boatman ask few question following path along for few hundred yard saw road ahead of here halted two of black handed over musket cutlass to care of sailor dominique also left cutlas behind a went on gave instruction to two companion now look here said in negro french say much will do talking just say word two if ask question mind three belong to brigantine be pilot captain have given message to send to friend who have gone up into hill asked to take be not sure about way be ready to pay well for guide expect that will say that lady came along that know how went afterwards then ask to come a guide promise to pay very well by time be close to hut a dominique assured before knocking at door stood alone there be old man woman inside boy of about seventeen dominique took off hat a entered said in french excuse for disturbing so late be pilot of vessel now in bay have be sent by captain to carry important message to gentleman who landed with two lady armed men did not give sufficient direction to find thought that if passed along here might be able to put in way came along here between eleven twelve think saw old man said heard afterwards that lady be being taken away because ship be thought going to be attacked by pirate have followed people from village went to help fight for gentleman have bought many thing have paid well for man be promised dollar if there be fighting four dollar if helped beat off pirate yes be so dominique said seems that be mistake still have cause for alarm for other vessel followed strangely however be explained now have be sent with message because captain thought that if sent white sailor must not give information do know sebastian old man asked son yes turned off to right two mile further on look here boy dominique said be promised twenty dollar if took message straight now if will go with find out will give five of a be stranger to people here might not answer question if go say that have to carry message doubt will tell way have gone lad jumped up will go with said perhaps when get there will not give money look here dominique said taking three dollar from pocket will leave with father will hand other two a soon a get within sight of place where be lad be quite satisfied five dollar be more than must earn by two month work a soon a went out dominique whispered to one of boatman to go back tell frank what have taken place to beg to follow at distance behind whenever took fresh turning one of boatman must always be left until came up frank have difficulty in understanding boatman french be rather by gesture than word that gathered meaning a soon a message be given negro hurried on until overtook dominique be sorry now that did not bring pedro frank said however think made out what have to say dominique have got someone to go with to do questioning a arranged with will leave one other of men time turn off from road be following will be very good arrangement so far have be most fortunate know now that be following will be hard if manage to keep clue now that have once got hold of when came to road that branched off to right other boatman be waiting pointed up road then ran on silently ahead fresh turn be made for long distance twice be stopped by one of black who managed to inform that dominique guide be making inquiry at hut ahead road have now become mere track be continually mounting other track have branched off leading frank supposed to small hill village after going ten mile lad told dominique that be useless for to go further for that there be more hut near track beyond fact that two woman be on horseback when passed last hut nothing be learned there be of use to go further guide said there be house near here to inquire at there be three four more path that turn off from here must stop until morning then will go on alone make inquiry of shepherd cottager see thought that must find tonight if work day tomorrow will expect three more dollar will have dominique said here be blanket will share one with one of boatman lad at once lay down pulled blanket over head a soon a did so dominique motioned to two boatman to do same then went back along track until met frank party a hill be for most part covered with tree almost up to summit frank party have only to turn short distance off from path on receiving dominique news that guide have stopped be half past one frank said holding lantern pilot have left with to watch will get four hour sleep have better serve tot of grog round george will keep out damp night air one of black be carrying basket of men have brought water bottle pannikin put water in lad frank said must be good thing to eat bit of biscuit with dominique have told frank that guide have made remark about two black dropping behind so often latter took out handkerchief tore into eight piece gave to wherever turn off dominique drop one of piece on path will be quite sufficient yes sar see know when start up path whether be right path go up one if find dat hit not de one dey go den come back again try anoder what to do after thinking for little time frank suggested that dominique best way must be to tell guide that be footsore that a several path must have to be searched one of men must sit down there other must accompany boy bring down word when right path have be discovered a soon a became light frank without rousing men went out into path moved cautiously up have just started when saw dominique coming towards right sar boy gone on hunt about when find send sam back to fetch de oder stay with oh have sent with yes sar thought better if only one man go when come back boy must talk to people perhaps talk too much so sent men be best plan doubt frank agreed will join men remain there until come for dat best thing sar people might come along better dey not see be twelve o'clock before dominique joined waiting group in wood have be long time finding track dominique yes sar bery long time dey try four track wrong den dey try sam say boy tell try last because bad track lead ober hill to place where obi man live black fellow like to go there bad men there steal child away make sacrifice to fetish people here believe that obi man bery strong dey send present to to make rain to kill enemy dey like go near demselves dere be hut little up dat road party went by dere yesterday more house on road sam say boy wait dere till bring back to den go home not like to go further say ca miss way dat path lead straight to obi man place fetish on road strike people dead dat go dar without leab ob obi man will suit well altogether frank said how far be to where guide be one half hour walk then will be off at once be glad to be on move again in spite of heat proceeded at rapid pace until boatman sam said that be close to spot where have left companion with guide rest then entered wood dominique went on with boatman ten minute later young negro came down path have doubt that be guide dominique arrived two three minute later suppose be guide went down frank said a stepped out dat sar said quite sure path go to obi man place be mile away in centre of hill pretend want to go on said go for thousand dollar so pay money go back tell use hunt for friend if obi man hab not giben dem leab to go see den fetish change dem into snake if gib leab not know dat oder two men be friend den de fetish change into snake well there be one comfort dominique will be able to march boldly along without being afraid of meeting anyone yes sar sam be little frightened not much not believe much in san domingo about fetish dey better dan dese hayti people still sam not like suppose told that be fool dominique yes sar tell too dat white man tink nothing ob obi man hang by neck if try fetish against dem having picked up sam proceeded at brisk pace along path frank leading way with george lechmere see said carthew must have be uneasy in mind along have doubt directly put into bay decided to make headquarters set about preparing place where must carry off to where there must be very little chance of being traced down at village by water heard of obi man have evidently great power in part of island fellow be great rascal carthew may have gone sent to made arrangement that party must if necessary be allowed to establish camp in valley where fellow life of course promising handsome present must have chosen safer place following hard a have done on track have obtained clue be not probable that of native whom dominique have questioned have smallest idea that party be going towards fetish man place in fact only man must know be negro at last hut may be sure be questioned by searching party must not dare to give information might excite anger of man be likely enough that fellow have gang of men with bound to partly by interest partly by superstitious fear will probably have to reckon with fellow in addition to carthew own force seems to have taken ten twelve of black from village with must have fear of going when told that be under special protection of fetish man then see have four of own sailor friend so that have equal number of white men five negro against ten twelve fetishman gang however hope that will have advantage of surprise if so think that may feel pretty confident that will at rate in first place carry off miss greendale maid danger wo be in attack in retreat obi fellow may raise whole country against there be one thing population be scanty up here wo be until get down towards lower ground that will be able to muster strongly enough to be really formidable may have to fight hard to get down to boat see be twenty mile march sha be able to go very fast for although miss greendale maid might keep up well for distance must be worn out long before got to shore while black fellow must be able to travel by other path to arouse villager a went make very hot indeed for there be one thing will have advantage of darkness major in wood must be difficult for to know how fast be going might strike off into other path if necessary carry miss greendale maid must make couple of litter for with four to litter must travel along at good rate of speed in three hour found that path be descending into deep narrow valley on way passed many of fetish sign so terrible to negro imagination piece of blue string with feather rag attached to be stretched across path clump of feather hung suspended from tree flat stone with berry shell crooked piece of wood be nailed against trunk of tree at first four negro boatman showed sign of terror on approaching mysterious symbol grew pale with fright when frank broke string barred path when saw that evil resulted from audacious act that avenging bolt fell upon head mustered up courage in time even grinned a sailor made jeering remark at mysterious emblem a soon a began to descend into valley be evident that be nearing destination frank halted now dominique do object to go down find out about be quite ready to go be le likely to be noticed than be there be hurry for wish to move until within hour of sunset perhaps two hour there be fear of meeting with interruption until get back to point where started morning must be a well therefore to be back there just before dark go sar strip dat best not seen so easy among de tree quite right dominique what want to find out be exact position of camp hut for doubt built hut of sort where miss greendale be see how can best get a close to a possible then must be a well to find out what sort of village obi man have got how many men probably contains risk anything to do object be to surprise carthew camp must take chance a to black if be seen alarm given carthew might carry miss greendale off again so mind about obi village unless be sure that can obtain view of without risk of being seen manage dat negro said confidently dey not on de lookout crawl up among de tree see eberyting fear whatsomeber dominique stripped started down path while rest retired into shelter of tree anxious two hour passed party listening intently for sound might tell of

thank god be over frank bertha said a stood together watching sight inlet be now lit up from side to side on shore state of wild excitement prevailed boat have reached shore negro there have rushed down to hear what have taken place to inquire after friend above yell shout of frenzied negro sounded deep roar of horn angry beating of obi drum number of torch bearer be among crowd although nearly mile away scene must be perfectly made out from yacht boatman have received promised pay a soon a frank have reached yacht have taken place in boat dominique told frank that must not go till osprey sailed a be afraid of being pursued attacked by villager boat if did so chapter a frank stood gazing at scene george lechmere touched frank looking round saw that wished to speak to privately what be george asked when have stepped few pace from bertha look there major george said handing field glass thought have settled old score with devil have looked after own mean to say george that be carthew again be sure enough sir must have sworn have done for if have thought there have be slightest doubt about must have put pistol ball through head frank raised glass to eye just where torch be thickest must make out man figure raised above head of rest be supported on litter head be swathed with bandage have raised into sitting position supported by one arm while waved other passionately be evidently haranguing crowd a frank looked saw figure sink down then there be deep roll of drum fantastic looking figure daubed a seemed with paint wearing huge mask appeared in place drum horn be silent shouting of negro be at once hushed man too harangued crowd when ceased there be loud yell general movement among throng at moment hawkins came up chain be up down sir will make sail wind be very light think that be enough to take out yes make sail hawkins a quickly a can be afraid that fellow be coming out to attack want to kill of poor devil there be small boat coming out from shore towards craft white sailor be on board will have on too up with anchor hawkins shouted make sail at once look sharp hearties work with will will have nigger on again never be sail made on osprey more quickly by time that anchor be apeak lower sail be set will tell black to tow boat behind hawkins asked frank a yacht began to steal through water let tow alongside hawkins suppose people ashore know that have native boat with if did must be sure that came from nipes might set up feud cost life especially a obi scoundrel be concerned in affair then moved away to george lechmere say word about fellow carthew said miss greendale think be killed be just a well that must continue to think that be safe from in future so far a be concerned think be true must not answer for major have ruined plan burned yacht a long a life will never forgive well be of use to worry about now george expect that will hear more about someday what be doing frank bertha asked a rejoined think that be getting into boat again yes fancy be going to try to take have more chance of doing so than have of flying obi man have worked up to state of frenzy will evaporate pretty quickly when get within range of musket have got cannon on board have not yes did not bring off ammunition with be men idea to bring a trophy however have plenty of powder can load with bullet certainly wo use if can be possibly avoided have grudge against poor fellow who have be told that be desperate pirate who be only doing what believe to be meritorious action in trying to capture in few minute six boat put out from shore osprey be not going through water more than two mile hour though have stitch of canvas spread frank have gun taken aft loaded a boat came within circle of light of burning yacht must be seen that be crowded with men who encouraged with defiant yell shout excited derision of osprey crew when got within quarter of mile opened fusillade of musketry ball dropped in water distance astern of yacht a boat came nearer however began to drop round sit down behind bulwark frank said be not good shot stray ball might come on board there be use running risk by time have persuaded bertha to go below boat rowed on until seventy eighty yard off osprey shouting have gradually died away for silence on board yacht oppressed there be something unnatural about superstitious fear of obi man disappeared before dread of unknown a if affected simultaneously by disquietude of companion rower stopped work at same moment dominique have already received instruction at once hailed in french if value life turn back have gun of brigantine be crammed with bullet be pointed at owner have to give word will all be blown to piece be good man wish harm have come here not to quarrel with poor ignorant black fellow to rescue two lady villain that ship belongs to have carried off therefore go away back to wife family while be able to for if come one foot nearer not one of will live to return news that osprey have cannon from brigantine on board came like thunderbolt upon negro prospect of fight with men who have so easily captured brigantine be unpleasant enough that be also to encounter cannon be altogether too much for general shout of fire go back rose from boat for minute two lay motionless afraid even to dip oar in water lest must bring down storm upon a osprey glided slowly away rearmost boat began to turn round others followed example be soon rowing back even more rapidly than have come can cast off boat hawkins a soon a be out into bay frank said then went down below trouble be over at last dear can have quiet talk said a expected negro lost heart a soon a came near threat of round of grape from gun finally settled be off for home will hear more of now have best be off to bed at once have have terrible day of be just two o'clock ah be right broke off a steward entered carrying tray with tea thing have forgotten about necessity have better call anna in must want cup too poor girl yes must like cup of tea bertha said a sat down to tray really feel so tired a must think will feel more afterwards be afraid frank replied excitement have kept up yes felt dreadfully tired did anna before gave up two hour row in boat excitement here have made almost forget seems to now quite impossible that can be only about nine hour since rushed out so suddenly with men seems to quite far off further than many thing do happened week ago please to remember that advice to go to bed be quite a seasonable in case a in mine when have seen leave saloon frank went on deck for last look round think that there be chance of anything happening before morning hawkins will of course keep sharp lookout let know will look out sir have sent four hand who be with down to berth a soon a nigger turned back lechmere have turned in too be wind freshening at not yet sir suppose that will get more than have now till day begin to break still be crawling on will be out in bay in quarter of hour when frank got up at sunrise found that yacht be just rounding point of bay looked behind boat be in view nothing moving see said a first mate who be in charge came up have not seen thing on water sir hardly expected that there must be be probable that a soon a boat got back carthew sent skipper mate off with couple of men to port au prince to lay complaint for piracy against even if got horse must take couple of day to get there be if be not much better rider than majority of sailor be then be likely that there must be time lost in formality even if there be government steamer lying in port must take long time to get up steam moreover be by mean sure that even carthew must venture on impudent thing a that be certain that must get into bad scrape for boarding burning vessel in haytian water be harm must do british consul must certainly be more likely to believe story of owner of royal squadron yacht backed by of captain mate crew by miss greendale maid than tale of owner of vessel must give satisfactory explanation for being here besides will know before steamer must start in chase must be certainly two perhaps three day away whether must make for jamaica bermuda round northwestern point of bay then for england must have clue how will lay course sir wind have freshened already be slipping through water at good four knot now will keep along side a far a point at rate if carthew have sent for steamer be likely to have ordered man down to headland to see course be taking when have got so far that can not be made out from there will sail north for cape la mole think must be safe enough to lay course at once wish to run slightest risk can be avoided wind continued to freshen to frank satisfaction be when bertha came on deck at eight o'clock running along coast at seven knot hour have slept well asked a took hand yes thought when lay down that must be impossible for to sleep at have be wonderful day be so strange so sudden so happy just a be thinking so suppose dropped off slept till anna woke three quarter of hour ago told what time be frank did not say anything yesterday not even single word of thanks for that have done for know very well that be not because did not feel because if have said anything at must have broken down be very thing that knew ought not to do know that will have life to prove how thankful be know dear between surely nothing need be said be a thankful have be mean of saving a can be be almost miraculously enabled to follow track so successfully breakfast be ready steward announced from companion coming steward have told bertha to lay for three thought that must be pleasanter for to have anna with at meal a suppose have taken with since be carried off thank said gratefully wo be quite so nice for know perhaps will be better well anna be looking very well frank said a sat down must officiate with coffee bertha will see after eatable yes anna doe look well bertha said have borne up capitally ever since first two day have have meal together in cabin miss greendale have be great deal braver than have sir anna said quietly have be wonderfully brave though be very good to say have borne up well know very well that have not be a brave a ought must not help breaking down cry sometimes for did think that must never get home again except carrying away carthew did not behave altogether so badly bertha first day that got on board told be to stay there until consented to marry told that in case must become permanent resident on board that sooner later must be rescued only said then that hoped that must change mind in time admitted that conduct have be inexcusable that love for have driven to that have only won a many knight have won bride before now at first made sure that when put into port must be able somehow to make condition known realised for first time what be going to be when saw stand off lizard lay head for south up to time have scarcely exchanged word with have said at once that unless have meal in own cabin with anna must eat nothing at said quite courteously must confess must in respect do a pleased consistent with safety from time said 'good morning ' gravely when came up on deck with anna
