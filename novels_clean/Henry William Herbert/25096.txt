ancient precedent how caius servilius ahala slew with own hand spurius melius when plotting revolution there be there be of old that energy of virtue in commonwealth brave men hedged traitorous citizen about with heavier penalty than most deadly foe hold powerful weighty decree of senate against thee o catiline counsel sanction of order have be wanting to republic say openly consul be wanting in duty senate decreed once that lucius opimius then consul must see that republic took harm not one night intervened caius gracchus be slain on mere suspicion of sedition son of most noble

italy hostile to republic in defile open on etruria daily number of foe be increasing yet general of camp leader of foe see within wall aye even in senate day by day plotting intestine blow against state be to order thee to be arrested to be slain now o catiline must have cause think to dread reproach of good citizen for having stricken thee too late rather than of one for having stricken thee too severely yet that must have be done long ago be not yet for certain reason persuaded to do now then then at length will slay thee when there be not man so base so desperately wicked so like to thee in character will own thy slaying just so long a there will be one man who dare to defend thee thou shalt live thou shalt live a now thou livest beset on side by numerous steady guard so thou canst not even stir against commonwealth eye moreover ear of many even a heretofore will spy thee out at unawares mount guard on thee in private for what be there catiline thou now canst expect more

purpose take along a thy adviser forget thy scheme of massacre of conflagration thou art hemmed in on side thy council be more clear to than day thou canst now review with dost thou remember how stated in senate on twelfth day before calends of november that caius manlius satellite co minister of thy audacity must be in arm on given day day must be sixth before calends of november did err catiline not in fact so great a be so atrocious so incredible what be much more wondrous in very day again told thee in senate thou hadst conspired to slay first men of state on fifth day before calends of november when many leading men of rome quitted city not so much to preserve life a to mar thy council canst thou deny thou wert hemmed in on day by guard hindered by vigilance from stirring thy hand against state when frustrate by departure of rest thou saidst that blood ours who have remained behind must satisfy thee what when thou wert so confident of seizing prneste by nocturnal escalade upon very calends of november didst thou not feel that be by order that colony be garrisoned guarded watched impregnable thou doest nothing plottest nothing thinkest nothing will not say not hear will not see will not conspicuously comprehend review with now transaction of night before last so shalt thou understand that watch far more vigilantly for safety than thou for destruction of state say that on former night thou didst go to street of scythemakers will speak plainly to house of marcus lca thou didst meet there many of thy associate in crime madness wilt thou dare to deny why so silent if thou deniest will prove for see of here here in senate who be with thee oh ye immortal god in what region of earth do dwell in what city do live of what republic be citizen here be here in midst of conscript father here in council most sacred most solemn of universal world who be planning slaughter of slaughter of planning ruin of city therein ruin of world consul see men ask opinion on state matter nay whom be justice to slaughter with sword refrain a yet from wounding with word thou wert therefore in house of lca on night o catiline thou didst allot district of italy thou didst determine whither one of thy follower must set forth thou didst choose whom thou wouldst lead along with thee whom leave behind thou didst assign ward of city for conflagration thou didst assert that ere long thou wouldst go forth in person thou saidst there be one cause why thou shouldst yet delay little namely that be alive two roman knight be found who offered to liberate thee from care promised that must butcher that very night little before daylight in own bed of thing be aware when assembly be scarce yet broken up strengthened house guarded with unwonted garrison refused admittance to whom thou hadst sent to salute when arrived even a have predicted to many eminent men that must arrive at very time since then thing stand thus o catiline proceed a thou hast begun depart when thou wilt from city gate be open begone too long already have camp of manlius lacked general lead forth with morrow thy men if not a many at least a thou art able purify city of thy presence thou wilt discharge from great terror so soon a wall will be interposed between thee dwell among thou canst now no longer will not endure will not suffer will not permit great thanks must be rendered to immortal god to stator jove especially ancient guardian of city that have escaped so many time already plague so foul so horrible so fraught with ruin to republic not often be highest weal of state jeoparded in person of single individual so long a plotted against merely a consul elect o catiline protected not by public guard by private diligence when at late comitia thou wouldst have murdered presiding a consul in field of mar with thy competitor checked thy nefarious plan by protection force of friend without exciting public tumult in word a often a thou hast thrust at have parried blow although perceived clearly that fall be conjoined with dread calamity to republic now now thou dost strike openly at whole commonwealth dwelling of city dost summon temple of immortal god life of citizen in word italy to havoc perdition wherefore seeing that a yet dare not do what must be first duty what be ancient peculiar usage of state in accordance with discipline of father will at least do in respect to security be more lenient in respect to common good more useful for must command thee to be slain surviving band of thy conspirator must settle down in republic if a have be long exhorting thee thou wilt go forth vast pestilent contamination of thy comrade will be drained out of city what be catiline dost hesitate to do for bidding of thine own accord thou wert about doing consul command enemy to go forth from state dost thou enquire of whether into exile order if thou wilt have counsel advise for what be there o catiline can delight thee longer in city in there be not

mustered band of assassin to slay consul noblest of citizen that relenting of thy heart faltering from fear opposed thy guilt frenzy wonted good fortune of commonwealth now pas from thing for be crime not known to have there not be many more recently committed how many time hast not thou thrust at while elect how many time when consul how many thrust of thine so nearly aimed that appeared inevitable have not shunned by slight diversion a say of gladiator by movement of body thou doest nothing attemptest nothing plannest nothing can escape knowledge at moment when must know yet thou wilt cease from endeavoring from plotting how many time already hath that dagger be wrested from thy hand how many time hath fallen by chance escaped thy grasp still thou canst not be deprived of more than instant space yet know not with what unhallowed rite have be consecrated devoted by thee that thou shouldst deem necessary to flesh in body of consul now then what life be of thine for will now address thee not so may seem moved by detestation feel toward thee by compassion portion of be thy due moment since thou didst come into senate one man from so vast concourse from thine own chosen familiar friend saluted thee if have befallen one within memory of man wilt thou await loud contumely condemned already by most severe sentence of silence what wouldst thou have when seat around thee be left vacant on thy coming when consulars whom thou so frequently hadst designated unto slaughter a soon a thou didst take thy seat left portion of bench bare vacant with what spirit in one word can thou deem endurable by hercules did slave so dread a thy fellow citizen dread thee must conceive time for leaving own house dost thou not hold time to leave city if felt without just cause suspected odious to countryman must choose rather to be beyond reach of vision than to be gazed upon by hostile eye of men dost thou hesitate when conscious of thine own crime thou must acknowledge that hate of be just due long ago dost thou say hesitate to avoid presence sight of whose eye sens thine aspect day be wounding if thine own parent feared hated thee must by mean be reconciled thou wouldst presume withdraw whither beyond reach of eye now thy country be common parent of dread detests thee have passed judgment on thee long ago a meditating nothing parricide wilt thou now revere authority obey judgment yet dread violence since thus now deal with thee catiline thus speaks to thee in silence 'no deed of infamy hath be done in many year unless through thee deed of atrocity without thee to thee alone murder of many citizen to thee alone spoliation oppression of ally hath be free unpunished thou hast be powerful not only to escape law prosecution openly to break through overturn to thing though indeed intolerable have submitted a best might can now no longer be endured must be in one eternal dread of thee only catiline on what alarm soever alone must be source of terror that treason against can be imagined such a must be revolting to thy desperate criminality wherefore begone liberate from terror so that if true may not be ruined if false may at least shake with fear no longer ' if thy country must thus a have said parley with thee must not obtain what demand even if lack force to compel what more will say when thou didst offer thyself to go into private custody what when to shun suspicion thou didst profess thy willingness to take up thy residence under roof of manius lepidus refused by whom thou hadst audacity to come to request must admit thee to house when thou didst receive from answer must not exist within same house with man whose presence even inside same city wall esteemed vast peril to life thou didst then go to prtor quintus metellus then repulsed by to marcus marcellus thine own comrade virtuous man truly one whom past doubt thou didst deem likely to be most vigilant in guarding most crafty in suspecting most strenuous in bringing thee to justice how far will man be believed distant from deserving chain dungeon who judge to be worthy of safekeeping since then thing be so dost hesitate o catiline since here thou canst not tarry with equal mind to depart for other land give life rescued from many just deserved penalty to solitude exile 'lay matter thou sayest 'before senate ' for that be thou requirest 'and if order will command thee into banishment thou wilt obey bidding ' will not lay before for to do so be repugnant to character yet will so act that thou shalt clearly see what think of thee depart from city catiline deliver state from terror begone into banishment if be word for thou tarriest then great orator paused once again not to breathe though vehement uninterrupted torrent of eloquence might well have required interval of rest to give confounded listener occasion to note feeling of assembled senate perfectly in accordance with word be moment however that paused that ended again burst out thunderous weight of magnificent invective what mean catiline dost thou note dost thou observe silence permit word be mute why dost thou wait that confirmation of word thou seest given already by silence have spoken same word to admirable youth publius sextius to very valiant man marcus tell thee that very senate must have already in very temple laid violent hand on consul too most justly with regard to thee when quiescent approve when passive decree when mute cry aloud alone whose authority seems be very dear whose life most cheap in eye roman knight do likewise most honorable most worthy men other valiant citizen who stand about senate house whose dense rank thou couldst see whose zeal thou couldst discover whose patriotic cry thou couldst hear little while ago whose hand weapon have scarcely for long time restrained from thee whom will yet induce to escort thee to gate of rome if thou wilt leave city thou hast sought so long to devastate ruin yet what say can be hoped that anything must ever bend thee that thou shouldst ever be reformed that thou shouldst dream of flight thou shouldst contemplate exile must must indeed that immortal god might give thee purpose yet perceive if astounded by voice thou shouldst bend thy spirit to go into voluntary exile how vast storm of odium must hang over if not at present time when memory of thy villanies be recent at least from passion of posterity to be worth sacrifice so that storm burst on individual head be connected with peril to state that thou shouldst be moved by thine own vice thou shouldst dread penalty of law thou shouldst yield to exigences of republic indeed be not to be expected for thou art not one o catiline that sense of shame must ever recall thee from infamy sense of fear from peril glimmering of reason from insanity wherefore a have said many time already go forth from among if thou wouldst stir up against a constantly thou sayest against thine enemy storm of enmity odium then begone straightway into exile scarcely will have power to endure clamor of world scarcely will have power to sustain burthen of odium if thou wilt go into voluntary banishment now at consul bidding if on contrary thou wouldst advance glory reputation then go forth with thy lawless band of ruffian betake to manlius stir up desperate citizen to arm withdraw from good men levy war on thy country exult in unhallowed scheme of robbery murder so that thou shalt not pas for one driven forth by tyranny into arm of stranger for one joining by invitation own friend comrade yet why must invite thee when well know that thy confederate be sent forth already who nigh forum aurelium will wait in arm for arrival when well know that thou hast already day promised appointed whereon to join camp of manlius when well know that silver eagle hath be prepared already silver eagle will trust prove ruinous fatal to thee thine host to shrine have be established in thine own house thy villanies fitting incense for how shalt thou endure absence longer thou who wert wont to adore setting forth to sacrilege slaughter thou who so often hast upraised that impious right hand of thine from accursed altar to murder citizen of rome at length then at length thou must go forth whither long since thy frantic unbridled passion have impelled thee will war against thy country vex afflict thee nay rather will bring to thee strange unimaginable pleasure for to frantic career did nature give thee birth to hath thine own inclination trained to fortune preserved thee for never hast thou wished say not peaceful leisure war unless war be sacrilegious thou hast drawn together from most infamous of wretch wretch abandoned not only by fortune hope bodyguard of desperado among what pleasure wilt thou not experience in what bliss not exult in what rapture not madly revel when thou shalt see hear one virtuous man in such concourse of thy comrade to mode of life tended strenuous toil of thine be so widely talked of to lie on bare ground not lying in wait merely for occasion of adultery for opportunity of daring crime to watch through night not plotting merely against sleep of betrayed husband against property of murdered victim now then thou hast notable occasion for displaying illustrious quality of thine that wonderful endurance of hunger of cold of destitution by ere long thou shalt feel thyself undone ruined much however did accomplish when defeated thee in comitia thou shouldst strike at republic a exile rather than ravage a consul that warfare so villanously evoked by thee must be called rather struggle of base bandit than fair strife of warrior now conscript father may solemnly abjure deprecate just reproach of country listen pray earnestly to what say commit deeply to memory mind for if country who be much dearer to than life if italy if whole commonwealth must thus expostulate with 'what dost thou marcus tullius whom thou hast proved to be enemy whom thou seest future leader in war against whom thou knowest even now expected general in camp of foe author of crime head of conspiracy summoner of insurgent slave ruined citizen wilt thou suffer to go forth in such guise that will not be a one banished from wall rather a one let loose to war against city wilt thou not then command that will be led away to prison that will be hurried off to death that will be visited with last torment of law what be that dissuades thee be custom of thine ancestor not so for many time in republic have men even in private station inflicted death on traitor be law enacted concerning punishment of roman citizen not so for never in city have rebel against commonwealth be suffered to retain right of citizen roman dost thou shrink from odium of posterity if be so in truth thou dost repay great gratitude unto roman people who hath elevated thee man known by thine own action only commended by ancestral glory so rapidly through grade of honor to most high authority of consul if in fear of future odium if in dread of present peril thou dost neglect safety of citizen again if thou dost shrink from enmity whether dost deem most terrible that purchased by severe brave discharge of duty that by inability shameful weakness once more when italy will be waste with civil war when town will be demolished house blazing to sky dost fancy that thy good report will not be then consumed in fierce glare of enmity odium ' to most solemn appeal of country to mind of men who think in likewise will now make brief answer must have judged for best o conscript father catiline must have be done to death then must not have granted one hour tenure of existence to gladiator for if first of men noblest of citizen be graced not polluted by blood of saturninus gracchi flaccus many more in olden time there surely be cause why must apprehend burst of future odium for taking off parricide of republic yet if such odium did inevitably impend above have ever be of mind regard that hatred be earned by honorable duty not a reproach glory yet there be in assembly who see peril be imminent above seeing deny eyesight who have nursed hope of catiline by moderate decree strengthened conspiracy from birth until now by disbelieving existence many more there be not of wicked only of inexperienced who if must do justice upon man must raise cry have dealt with cruelly a regal tyrant now be well assured that if once arrive whither mean to go at camp of manlius there will be none so blind a not to see reality of conspiracy none so wicked a to deny on other hand be man slain alone perceive that ruin of state might indeed be repressed for season must not be suppressed for ever while if cast forth lead comrade with gather to host disbanded desperate outlaw not only will full grown pestilence of rome be utterly extinguished abolished very seed germ of evil will be extirpated for ever for be long time o conscript father that have be dwelling amid peril stratagem of conspiracy know not how be that ripeness of crime maturity of ancient guilt frenzy hath burst to light at once during consulship know that if from so vast horde of assassin bandit man alone be taken off may perchance be relieved for brief space from apprehension dismay peril will strike inward settle down into vein vitals of commonwealth a oftentimes men laboring under dread disease if while tossing in feverish heat drink cold water will seem indeed to be relieved for brief space be thereafter much more seriously perilously afflicted so will ulcer exists in republic if relieved by cutting off man grow more inveterate others left alive wherefore o conscript father let wicked withdraw let retire from among good let herd together in one place let in one word a often have said before be divided from by city wall let cease to plot against consul in own house to stand about tribunal of city prtor deterring from justice to beset even senate house with sword to prepare blazing brand fiery arrow for conflagration of city let in one word be borne a inscription upon brow of citizen what be sentiment toward republic can promise o conscript father that there will be such diligence in consul such valor in roman knight such unanimity in good citizen that will see catiline once departed be secret exposed be dark brought to light be dangerous put down be guilty punished under omen catiline to eternal welfare of state to thine own ruin destruction to perdition of who have linked with thee in league of infamy parricide go forth to thine atrocious sacrilegious warfare do thou jove who wert consecrated by romulus under

least check of army sent against occur under such circumstance there be little doubt that eruption of gladiator servile insurrection must liberate traitor perhaps even crown frantic rashness with success such be state of thing on morning of none brow of great consul be dark heart heavy a entered senate convened on occasion in temple of jupiter stator in order to take voice of body on fate of lentulus rest scarcely have taken seat before messenger be introduced breathless pale herald of present insurrection freedman client of lentulus be in arm gladiator slave of cethegus be up already hurrying through street toward house of quintus cornificius wherein master be confined many slave of other house small number of disaffected citizen have joined watch be well nigh overpowered ere long roar of mob might be heard even within hallowed precinct booming up from narrow street about forum like distant sound of heavy surf messenger followed first in quick succession one manipule of soldier have be overpowered driven into house where defended though hard set with missile multitude be thundering at gate of city prison if not quelled immediately must shortly swell number by accession of desperate criminal convicted slave reckless debtor who be crowded together in abode of guilt wretchedness then be seen when howl of rabble be echoing through arch of sanctuary wherein sate when massacre conflagration be imminent close at hand then be seen how much of real majesty power resided still in roman senate firm a when hannibal be thundering at gate solemn a when gaul be ravaging city sat debated grave fearless unmoved order be issued to concentrate force upon spot where tumult be raging knight who be collected under arm in whole force of order without gate of temple a guard

short time after deep swell of charging shout rose high above discordant clamor of mob from hollow of velabrum still not senator left seat changed countenance although might be seen by fiery glance clinched hand of among younger noble that must have gladly joined knight in charging hereditary enemy democratic rabble question be then debating be of more weight however than triumph over mob for by decision of question be to be determined whether traitor treason must be crushed simultaneously forever whether rome must be abandoned to pleasure of rebel that question be life death of lentulus cethegus gabinius statilius cparius of whom be in separate custody last having be brought in on previous evening arrested on way to camp of catiline manlius must senate decree death commonwealth might be deemed safe must absolve by weakness republic must be lost on turn of die did that question seem to hang decius junius silanus whose opinion be first asked spoke briefly strenuously to point a became consul elect soon to be first magistrate of great empire declared for capital punishment of named above of four others lucius cassius publius furius publius umbrenus quintus annius if must be thereafter apprehended several others of high patrician family followed on same side one have a yet ventured openly to urge impunity of parricide although tiberius nero have recommended delay in taking question casting of prisoner meanwhile into actual incarceration under safeguard of military force have now come to turn of caius julius csar great leader then of democratic faction great captain be to be in after day first emperor of subjugated rome orator second if second to cicero alone ardent impassioned yet bland clement easy liberal of hand council averse to cicero from personal pique a well a from party opposition eager candidate for popular applause favor be most natural that must take side with conspirator still name having be coupled obscurely with infamous design although cicero have positively refused to suffer accusation impeachment required so much boldness so much audacity indeed to enable to stand forward a open champion that many men disbelieved that must venture on step so hazardous greatest possible anxiety be manifested therefore in house when distinguished senator arose began in low deep harmonious tone word rolled forth like gentle river in easy silvery flow be well said conscript father that men who debate on dubious matter must be unbiassed in opinion by hate friendship clemency anger when passion intervene mind can rarely perceive truth hath at one time man obeyed interest pleasure intellect there prevails where most be exerted if passion governs passion hath sole sway reason be powerless be easy task for conscript father to quote instance in king nation impelled by enmity pity have taken unadvised evil counsel prefer to cite wherein ancestor defying influence of passion have acted well wisely during macedonian war waged against king perseus state of rhodes splendid then stately have be built up by aid opulence of rome proved faithless to foe yet when war being ended debate be have concerning father suffered citizen to go unpunished in order that men might infer that rome have gone to war for greed not for just resentment again in punic war although carthaginian repeatedly committed outrage against in violation of truce treaty never once did follow example considering rather what must seem worthy of than what might be inflicted justly on foe same consideration must now take conscript father having care that crime of publius lentulus fellow weigh not upon mind with greater potency than own dignity honor that ye obey not rather dictate of resentment than teaching of old renown for if punishment worthy crime can be discovered approve of of how new precedent soever if enormity of guilt overtop invention of men then will vote that abide by custom prescribed by law institution many of who have already spoken have dilated in glowing set phrase on peril have menaced republic have descanted on horror of warfare on woe befall vanquished rape of virgin tearing of child from parental arm ransacking of human home divine temple subjecting of matron to brutal will of conqueror havoc conflagration place filled with arm corps with massacre misery in name of immortal god to what do such oration tend do aim at inflaming wrath against conspiracy vain vain be such intent for be probable that word will inflame mind of one if such so atrocious fact have failed to inflame be indeed impossible hath man at period esteemed own injury too lightly most person on contrary hold more heavy than be consequence fall not equally on men conscript father who in lowly place pas life in obscurity escape censure of world if err on occasion under influence of passion fortune fame be equal who endowed with high command live in exalted station perform action of life in full gaze of men thus to greatest fortune smallest licence be conceded great man must in case consult affection anger least of must yield to passion that be styled wrath in lowly born becomes tyranny cruel pride in high noble indeed think with who have preceded that torture be too small for atrocity crime be human nature trick to remember always that occurs last in order forgetful of criminal guilt world dwells ever on horror of punishment if lean never so little to side of severity well sure be that speech of decius silanus brave energetic man be dictated by love for republic that in cause so weighty be moved neither by favor resentment yet vote to eye appears say not cruel for what must be cruel inflicted on such men foreign to sense of institution now be clear silanus that fear of future peril indignation at past wrong impelled to vote for unprecedented penalty of fear be needle to speak farther when through active energy of most eminent man consul such force be assembled under arm concerning punishment of men must speak however a circumstance of case require must admit that in agony wo death be penalty rather repose from sorrow death alone be refuge from mortal suffering in death alone there be place for joy grief if be not so wherefore in name of god have ye not added also to sentence that be scourged before execution be that porcian law forbids can not be since other law a strenuously prohibit infliction of capital punishment on condemned citizen enjoining that be suffered to go into exile be then that to be scourged be more severe cruel than to be slain not so for what can be too severe too cruel for men convicted of such crime if on other hand be le severe how be fitting to obey law in lesser set at naught in greater article will ask perchance who will find fault with punishment inflicted upon parricide of republic time future day fortune whose caprice governs nation true men merit can befall do ye conscript father pause on precedent establish against others never did bad example arise from good precedent only when rein of empire have fallen from wise hand into ignorant wicked guidance good example be perverted from grand worthy to base unworthy end men of lacedemon when have conquered athens set thirty tyrant at helm who must control commonwealth at first began to take off guiltiest individual wretch hated by without form of trial thereat people be rejoiced cried out that death be just merited ere long when license have gained ground slew alike virtuous guilty governed by terror thus did that state oppressed by slavery rue bitterly insane mirth within memory when victorious sylla commanded damasippus crew who have grown up blight to republic to be put to sword edge who did not praise deed who did not exclaim earnestly that men factious infamous who have torn republic by tumult be slain justly yet deed be commencement of great havoc for when one envied city mansion country farm nay plate garment of strove with energy to have on list of proscription therefore who exulted at death of damasippus be ere long dragged to execution be there end put to massacre until sylla have satiated men with plunder thing indeed fear not under marcus tullius at day in mighty state there be many diverse disposition may be at time under consul who will perhaps hold army at back that wrong will be taken for right if be so when on precedent by decree of senate consul will have drawn sword who will compel to put back into scabbard who moderate execution ancestor o conscript father never lacked wisdom in design energy in action did pride restrain from copying institution of neighbor deemed good wise arm offensive defensive imitated from samnite most of ensign of magistracy borrowed of tuscan in word whatsoever observed good fitting among ally foe followed up with greatest zeal at home chose to imitate rather than envy what be good in day after fashion of greek punished citizen with stripe took life of condemned criminal a republic grew in size party strife arose among multitudinous citizen innocent person be taken off under pretext of law many wrongful deed be committed with impunity then be porcian law enacted with others of like tenor permitting convict to depart into exile esteem o conscript father first great cause wherefore novel penalty be not established a precedent wisdom valor of ancestor who from small beginning created vast empire be greater far than who scarcely can retain what won so nobly must have therefore will ask men suffered to go at large so to augment host of catiline far from will vote thus that property be confiscated detained in perpetual fetter in municipality of italy be wealthiest strongest that senate never again consider case bring cause before people that whosoever will speak for be pronounced of senate enemy to country to common good of men specious artful oration in while affecting to condemn what dared not defend openly have more than insinuated doubt of legality of sentencing traitor be listened to by present with deep attention by secret partizan of conspiracy with joy exultation so sure did esteem that in teeth of insidious argument senate must not venture to inflict capital punishment on friend that evinced approbation by loud cheer while many of patrician party be shaken in previous conviction many of who perceived fallacy of sophistical reasoning detected latent determination to screen parricide of state felt hazard difficulty of proceeding a exigency of case required cicero brow grew dark a silanus avowed openly that have altered opinion must vote for motion of tiberius nero to defer judgment then cicero arose in noblest perhaps of oration exerted strenuously to controvert argument abolish evil influence of noble demagogue did not indeed openly urge death of traitor dwelt with tremendous force on atrocious nature of crime on consequence of success showed fallacy of csar insinuation that death be le severe enactment than perpetual imprisonment pointed out impossibility injustice of compelling municipality to take charge of prisoner insecurity of town a place of detention almost entire certainty that men must ere long be released by popular tumult party measure concluded with forcible earnest peroration appealing to senator by love of life of family of country to take counsel worthily of of common mother entreating to decree firmly promising that must execute sentence be what might fearlessly a sat down order be agitated like sea in tumultuous calm succeeds to wrath riot created by succession of gale blowing from different quarter murmur of approbation encouragement be mixed with groan loud evidence of displeasure passion of great concourse be aroused thoroughly debate waxed wild stormy senator arose after senator advocating death banishment emboldened by csar remark even proposing enlargement of conspirator at length when argument appeared to be exhausted hope left of anything like unanimous decision being adopted marcus portius cato arose from seat stern grave composed awful from severe integrity of grand character turbulent assembly be calm in moment eye be fixed on harsh feature of stoic ear hung rivetted in expectation on deep guttural intonation short vigorous sentence be evident almost ere began to speak that opinion must sway vote of order mind be greatly different said conscript father when consider peril of case recall to memory speech of whom have heard to day senator seems to have descanted on punishment of men who have levied war against country parent against health altar fact of case require not punishment of crime defence from assault other crime may punish after commission unless prevent from being done when be done vainly will ye ask for judgment city stormed nothing remains to vanquished now in name of immortal god call upon who have always set more store on mansion farm statue picture than on interest of state if desire to retain thing be what may to cling so lovingly if desire to give yourselves leisure for luxury arouse yourselves now never take up commonwealth be question now of tax question of plundering ally life liberty of one of be hanging on doubtful decision oftentimes conscript father have spoken at length in assembly oftentimes have inveighed against luxury avarice of citizen therefore have many men enemy who have never pardoned own soul even for trivial error must not readily excuse in others lust result in open criminality although neglected crime a matter of small moment still republic by stability opulence sustained weight cast on by negligence now however ask not whether will live corrupt virtuous ask not how will render rome most great most magnificent ask whether ourselves with that posse whatsoever will be yielded up to enemy who here will speak to of clemency pity long long ago have cast away true name of thing for now to be lavish of good of others be termed liberality audacity in guilt be denominated valor into such extremity have republic fallen let senator therefore since such be habitude moral be liberal of fortune of ally be merciful to pilferer of treasury let not be lavish in bestowing blood upon let not in pity for few scoundrel send good citizen to perdition caius csar spoke while since eloquently in set term in house concerning life death esteeming thing false presume be believed by most men of future state that wicked mean journey on different road from righteous inhabit place aloof from dark horrid waste fearful hath declared intent therefore to vote for confiscation of property detention of in borough town in close custody fearing that if be kept in rome may be rescued forcibly either by confederate in plot by hireling rabble just a if there be only rogue villain in city none throughout italy just a if audacity can not effect greatest thing there where mean of defence be smallest wherefore plan be absurd if fear peril from men if alone in midst of consternation so general fear more need be there that do fear wherefore when vote on fate of publius lentulus rest hold assured that be voting also on fate of catiline army on fate of whole conspiracy with more energy act more will courage fail if will see falter little at once will fall on fiercely be far from believing that ancestor raised republic from small state to great empire by dint of arm alone have be so much greater must have rendered who have much greater force than of citizen of ally of arm of horse there be other thing made great lack altogether at home industry abroad justice mind free to take counsel unbiassed by crime passion instead of thing posse luxury avarice public need private opulence praise wealth practice indolence between righteous guilty make distinction ambition gain reward of virtue be strange when separately one of take counsel for alone when at home be slave to pleasure here in senate house to bribery favor thence arises that general charge be made from quarter against helpless commonwealth will pas over noblest of citizen have conspired to put torch to republic have called to aid in open war gallic nation most hostile to name of roman chief of enemy be thundering above very head be hesitating even now what will do with enemy taken within very wall oh have better pity think poor young men have only erred little misled by ambition have better send away in arm swear must once take arm clemency mercifulness of yours will be changed into wo wailing forsooth be desperate crisis yet fear not yea by god do fear vehemently yet in indolence feebleness of mind waiting one upon other hesitate relying presume on protection of immortal who have so many time preserved republic in greatest danger aid of god be not gained by prayer womanish supplication to who watch who act who take counsel wisely thing turn out successful yield yourselves up to idleness sloth in vain will implore god be irate hostile in time of forefather titus manlius torquatus during gallic war commanded own son to be slain because have fought against order illustrious youth suffered penalty of immoderate valor do ye know delay what ye will decide against cruellest parricide be forsooth that life of men be in character repugnant to guilt oh spare dignity of lentulus if have ever spared own modesty own good report if have ever spared man god oh pardon youth of cethegus if be not second time that have waged war on country for wherefore must speak of gabinius statilius cparius who if ever felt care for republic must never have taken council to conclude conscript father if there be space for mistake must leave right willingly by hercules to be corrected by fact since will not be warned by word be hemmed in on side catiline with army be at very throat others of foe be within wall in bosom of state nothing can be prepared counsel taken so privately must know wherefore will vote thus seeing that republic be plunged into most fearful peril by guilty plot of atrocious citizen seeing that men be convicted on evidence of titus volturcius of ambassador of allobroges seeing that have confessed intent of murder conflagration other foul barbarous crime against fellow citizen native country will vote say execution according to custom of ancestor be done upon having thus confessed a upon men manifestly convicted of capital treason stern voice ceased bitter irony

resumed seat alone unexcited impassive word have done work guilty be smitten into silence even daring eloquence high heart of ambitious csar be subdued mute friend of country be encouraged to shake off apathy with one voice unanimous consulars of rome cried out for question applauding loudly energy fearlessness of cato accusing one of timidity weakness great majority of senate likewise exclaimed aloud that required more word be prepared to vote convinced that time have arrived for striking cicero put to vote according to regular form requiring who thought with marcus porcius cato to pas over to right of curule chair question be not in doubt moment for above three fourth of whole body arose a single man passed over to right of chair gathered about seat of cato while very few joined openly to julius csar who sat somewhat crest fallen scarcely able to conceal disappointment immediately on left of consul rallying however before vote of senate have be taken factious noble sprang to foot loudly called upon tribune in general upon lucius bestia in particular private friend of catiline understood by to be one of conspirator to interpose veto be too much however even for tribunician daring answer be made from bench of popular magistrate for once awed into patriotic silence low sneering laugh ran through crowded rank of patrician vote be taken now nearly unanimous for many men disgusted by last step who have believed measure to be unconstitutional passed across openly from csar side to of cato decree of senate be framed forthwith committed to writing by person appointed in presence of marcus porcius cato decius julius silanus a authority witness of act empowering consul to see execution done upon guilty where when must to seem fitting thus be that cicero cato for while

in olden time on summit of jutting crag in pass of appennines most of have fallen long before into utter ruin have be destroyed in border war of innumerable petty tribe ere roman became master of peninsula divided among portion of italy held in continual turmoil with incessant war foray have mouldered away by slow hand of ruthless time yet more have be pulled down for sake of material now filled more useful if le glorious station in enclosure of tilled field wall of rustic dwelling from such fate watchtower of usella have be saved by several accident natural artificial strength have prevented sack storm during earlier period of existence difficulty of approaching have saved solid masonry from cupidity of rural proprietor yet more formidable situation commanding one of great hill pass into cisalpine gaul have induced roman government to retain in use a fortified post so long a gallic neighbor be half subdued only capable of giving trouble by tumultuous incursion although have consisted therefore in first instance of little more than rude circular tower of architecture called cyclopean addition have be made to by roman of strong brick wall with parapet enclosing space of about hundred foot in diameter accessible only by single gateway with steep narrow path leading to thoroughly commanded by tower in front wall be founded on rough craggy bank of thirty foot in height rising from main road traversing defile by alone must be approached for on right left rock have be scarped artificially in rear there be natural gorge through narrow impetuous torrent raved between precipice hundred foot in depth although arch of twenty foot span must have crossed ravine with ease against wall at point on inner side roman have constructed small barrack with three apartment of

infantry having succeeded in reaching by aid of horse hour before pursuer came up have contrived to barricade gateway solidly with felled pine tree have even managed to bring in with yoke of ox mule laden with wine have seized from peasant in street of little village of usella a gallopped through goading blown weary animal to top of speed be singularly characteristic of brutal pertinacity perhaps of sagacity also of caius crispus that nothing must induce to release miserable julia who be incumbrance to flight hindrance to defence to entreaty promise of safety from captor reward from friend if must release have replied only with sneer saying that must ensure own safety at obolus fee that for reward must trust noble catiline for rest added imagine not that will escape to rejoice heart of slave arvina minion will fight 'till flesh be hacked from bone ere will make way in hither if do so will find thee dead dishonored pray therefore if thou be wise for success such might in part indeed have be reasoning for be cruel licentious a well a reckless audacious be probable that knowing to be in vicinity of catiline army calculated on finding method of conveying to information of prize lay within grasp so of securing rescue reward if have not however in first instance thought of be not long ere occurred to when at once proceeded to put into execution within hour of entrance of little party into semi ruinous strong hold legionary foot came up about hundred fifty men in number without scaling ladder artillery engine elated by success however immediately formed what be called tortoise by raising shield overlapping edge of above head in such manner a to make complete penthouse might defend from missile of besieged under cover of rushed forward dauntlessly to cut down palisade with hook ax in must have probably succeeded for arrow ordinary missile of defender rebounded rolled down innocuous from tough brass bound bull hide rebel be already well nigh in despair when caius crispus who have be playing part gallantly at barricade have stabbed two three of legionary with pilum in hand to hand encounter through aperture of grating rushed up to battlement covered with blood dust shouting ho by hercules will never do friend give yon crow bar so take lever of ax must roll down coping on head applied own skill vast personal strength to task in instant lever be fixed

parchment drove through bronze cuirass hurled to ground slain outright in instant have have got enough of shout boy victoria victoria wild cheering of rebel pealed high above roar of torrent striking dismay into soul of wretched julia although rebel have thus far succeeded legionary have fallen back bearing dead wounded with success be by mean absolute final man knew better than swordsmith watched soldier eagerly a drew off in orderly array into hollow way after short consultation posting directly in front of gate with sentinel thrown out in direction lighted large watch fire in road with intention evidently of converting storm into blockade few moment afterward saw soldier mount horse of slain centurion gallop down hill in direction of antonius ' army be well known to be lying to south eastward still few minute later small party be sent down into village returned bringing provision men almost immediately began to cook after having posted chain of videttes from one bank to other of precipitous ravine so a to assure that possibility of escape be left to besieged in direction by conceived escape to be practicable have exclaimed crispus a watched movement will give more trouble to night will make sure of by posting one sentinel above gate on head of watch tower then will light good fire in yard below feast there on beef wine of brute peasant legionary fancy that can starve out know not how well be provided hark niger go down butcher two beef when be flayed decapitated blow good loud trumpet blast roll down head over battlement long ere have consumed provender catiline will be down on in force go to look around place make certain with word ascended to summit of old watch tower stood there for many minute surveying whole conformation of country defence of place with calm skilful eye man be by mean destitute of certain natural talent aptitude for war have be cultivated improved might possibly have made captain speedily perceived therefore that defence be tenable so long only a ladder engine must be brought against be well assured must be done within twenty four hour at latest knew also want of provision must compel to surrender at discretion before many day felt to be very doubtful whether without strong effort on part catiline must hear at of situation until must be entirely too late began therefore at once to look about for mean of despatching envoy nothing doubting that succor must be sent to instantly must arch traitor be informed that lovely julia be prisoner awaiting licentious pleasure descending from battlement proceeded at once to barrack room in rear hoping to find possibility of lowering messenger into bed of stream transporting across ravine unseen by sentinel of enemy then casting open door of fast decaying wood work entered first of low mouldering unfurnished room stepping across paved floor with noiseless foot thrust head out of window gazed anxiously up down course of ravine became satisfied at once that idea be feasible for old wall be built at place in salient angle following natural line of cliff window of central room be situated in bottom of recess between two jutting curtain in of be embrasure be evident therefore that person lowered by middle window into gorge beneath must be screened from view of watcher by projection of wall crispus nothing doubted once in bottom of ravine path might be found more le difficult by to reach upper country beyond ravine rose many broken knoll covered with thick undergrowth of young chesnut holly wild laurel like through winding road might be discovered penetrating pass of hill crossing glen at half mile distance below on single arched brick bridge by joined causeway occupied by legionary having observed so much caius crispus be on point of withdrawing head forgetting about prisoner who on entrance into dismantled hold have be thrust in hither a into place where must be most out of harm way least likely to escape just a be satisfied with gazing lovely face of julia pale a image of statuary marble with splendid auburn hair unbound be advanced out of middle window evidently looking out like for mean of escape to prospect be not a to satisfactory uttering deep sigh shook head sadly wrung hand with expression of utter despair have have pretty one be too deep trow cried crispus whom have not yet observed with cruel laugh nothing swear without wing can descend abyss unless like sappho whom poet tell of must put end to love life together can not escape thus pretty one on outside will make sure of for rest will send watch cloak for bed supper wine will not starve fair julia one will harm here for will sleep across door night ere to morrow sunset will be in camp with catiline be a good a word for returned almost immediately bringing pile of watch cloak arranged into rude semblance of bed with pack saddle for pillow in innermost recess of inner room with bread beef broiled hastily on ember wine mixed with water last drank eagerly for fear anxiety have parched be faint with thirst before went out again looked earnestly from unlatticed window in order to assure that have mean of escape scarce be gone before heard shrill blast of roman trumpet blown clearly scientifically for watch setting soon afterward din bustle have be rife through livelong day sank into silence must hear brawling of brook below chafing raving against rock barred bed wind murmuring against leafless treetop shortly after became quite dark after sitting musing awhile with sad despairing heart putting up wild prayer to god for mercy protection went once more leaned out of window gazing wistfully on black stone foamy water nothing said to herself sadly repeating caius crispus ' word must descend hence without wing live be too true ala too true paused for moment then while flash of singular enthusiastic joy irradiated pallid lineament exclaimed great god be praised one can leap down die let life go what be life since can thus preserve honor paused again considered then clasped hand together seemed to be on point of casting into awful gulf resisted temptation said not yet not yet there be hope yet on earth will live awhile for hope for paullus can do at time of refuge at least can not rob will live yet awhile with word turned away quietly went to pile of watch cloak lying down forgot ere long sorrow dread in calm innocent slumber have not be very long asleep however when sound from without door aroused a started to foot caius crispus looked into cell with flambeau of pine wood blazing in right hand to ascertain if be still within safe under keeping have be sleeping have exclaimed that be well must be weary will have more wine water if will wine be athirst feverish will have water thrusting flambeau into earth between crevice in pavement left room abruptly scarce be gone leaving whole apartment blazing with bright light rendered object within clearly visible to spectator from farther side of ravine before shrill voice with something of feminine tone be heard on other brink exclaiming in suppressed tone hist hist julia great god who call on julia julia serena be thou most miserable made answer who call friend be wary silent will not lack aid julia heard heavy step of swordsmith approaching laying finger on lip sprang back hastily from window when gaoler entered be busy apparently in arranging miserable bed be not long that tarried for after casting one keen glance around to see that be right freed of hated presence taking torch along with leaving in utter darkness a soon a footstep have died away into silence hurried back to embrasure gazed forth earnestly moon have not yet risen gulf of ravine bank on side be black a night must discern nothing coughed gently hoping to attract attention of unknown friend to learn more of chance of escape farther sound signal be made to after watching long in hope deferred anxiety unspeakable returned to sad pallet bathed pillow with hot tear until wept at length into unconsciousness of suffering last refuge of wretched when have not christian hope to sustain be almost worn out with anxiety toil slept soundly until blowing of roman trumpet in pas again aroused before have well collected thought so a to satisfy where be wherefore shout groan of sudden conflict rattling of stone javelin on tiled roof clang of arm dread accompaniment of mortal conflict awoke to full sense of situation day lagged tediously slow one came near although watched farther side of gorge with frantic hope be so near akin to despair saw nothing heard nothing few wood pigeon among leafless tree top sob of torrent sigh of wintry wind at time indeed long stern swell of legionary trumpet must again sound for assault din of warfare must follow skirmish be of shorter shorter duration tumultuous cheering of rebel at close of onslaught proved that defence have be maintained at least that besieger have gained no advantage be perhaps four o'clock in afternoon sun be beginning to verge to westward when just after cessation of one of brief attack by must appear that besieger intended rather to harass garrison keep constantly on alert than to effect anything decided sound of armed footstep again reached ear of julia moment afterward caius crispus entered room hastily accompanied by niger rufus latter bearing in hand coil of twisted rope manufactured from raw hide of slaughtered cattle cut into narrow stripe ingeniously interwoven have exclaimed starting for moment a saw julia have forgotten have be hardly pressed day have have time to think of will have more leisure now be hungry julia for only reply pointed to food yet untouched have brought to on previous evening shook head sadly uttered not word well well exclaimed have time to talk about such matter now eat will will have crammed a stuff fat livered goose come niger must lose minute if attack again miss from battlement will be suspecting something will perhaps come prying to rear have seen soldier girl on side trow have be gazing from window day long in hope of escaping suppose will not tell truly if tell not truly will hold peace will tell have seen human being living thing indeed unless be thrush three wood pigeon fluttering in treetop yonder be lie dare be sworn cried niger if have be truth must not have breathed word of to beside be too cool altogether by mulciber patron if believed so must go hardly with matter not come must lose time passing into central room of three made one end of rope fast about waist of niger other to upright mullion in embrasure although broken half way up afforded ample purchase whereby to lower into chasm done man clambered out of window very coolly going backward a if be about to descend ladder when face be on point of disappearing below sill a hung by hand alone having foothold whatever said quietly if shout caius crispus haul up instantly will not do so if there be path below if whistle be sure that be right lower away farewell hold on hold on man replied crispus quickly turn round so a to bring back to crag face else will angle of rock maim dust blind be most bravely done be right good cragsman be born among crag at event answered other think now that be going to die among what of one must die day fewer word lower away say be tired of hanging here between heaven tartarus word be spoken farther by of party smith with aid of rufus paid out line rapidly although steadily hand under hand until whole length be run out with exception of three four foot just at moment when crispus be beginning to despair of success be half afraid that have miscalculated length of rope strain on be slackened for moment then ceased altogether next instant low guarded whistle rose from gorge above gurgling of water not so loud a to reach ear save for be intended grim smile curled swordsmith lip fierce eye glittered with cruel triumph be safe now catiline will be here long before daybreak prayer have availed julia for doubt not added with malicious irony that have prayed for before have time to reply to cruel sarcasm fresh swell of besieger trumpet loud burst of shout warcries from battlement announced fresh attack smith rushed from room instantly with rufus at heel julia have already made one step toward window intending to attempt perilous descent alone unaided when crispus turned back suddenly cry rope rope by god leave rope hath enough of amazon blood in to attempt of roman blood say rather exclaimed springing toward casement half maddened in perceiving last hope frustrated have reached surely must have perished for female head hand how strong resolute so ever must have descended that frail rope even if must ruffian rather than see so escape must have cut asunder so precipitated to bottom of rocky chasm did not attain object for caius crispus caught with arm around waist threw so violently to after end of room that head striking angle of wall be stunned for moment lay almost senseless on floor while savage with rude brutal laugh at disappointment rushed out of room bearing rope along with scarce have gone however when audible distinctly amid dissonant danger of fray same feminine voice have heard on previous night again aroused cry hist hist hist julia sprang to foot gained window in moment there on other verge of chasm near twenty foot distant from window at stood discovered figure of slender dark eyed dark complexioned boy clad in hunter tunic bearing bow in hand quiver full of arrow on shoulder have never seen that boy before yet be there something in feature expression seemed familiar to that sort of vague resemblance to something well known accustomed lead men to suppose that must have dreamed of thing mysteriously enough seem to remember on first occurrence boy raised hand joyously cried aloud without fear of being heard well knowing that eye ear of defender of place be turned to side when fight be raging be of good cheer be saved julia paullus be nigh at hand ere come will save be of good courage watch well window seem to be observing nothing with word turned away be lost to sight in instant among thickly set underwood ere long however caught glimpse of again mounted upon beautiful white horse gallopping like wind down sandy road wound through wooded knoll toward bridge below again lost again glanced upon sight for single second a spurred fleet horse across single arch of brick dashed into wood on hither side of torrent two weary hour passed sun be nigh to setting have seen heard nothing more heart sickening with hope deferred frame trembling with terrible excitement have almost begun to doubt whether whole appearance of boy might not have be mere illusion of feverish sens vain creation of distempered fancy still fiercer than before battle raged without now there be intermission of uproar to be added crashing of roof beneath heavy stone betokening that engine of kind have be brought up from host constructed on spot at length however close watch be rewarded slight stir among evergreen bush on brink of opposite cliff caught quick eye in moment head of man not of boy whom have seen before yet a hope suggested of own paullus of aquiline nosed clean shorn roman soldier with intelligent expression quick eye be thrust forward perceiving julia at window drew back for second boy appeared in place then showed together soldier holding in hand bow arrow of hunter youth be friend said boy do that command so fiercely be battle raging now that be sign rather than word comprehended next moment gesture of hand warned to withdraw from embrasure scarcely have done so before arrow whistled from bow dropped into room having piece of very slender twine attached to end of perceiving intention at glance quick witted girl detached string from shaft without delay throwing latter out of window lest must betray plan drew in twine until have forty yard within room when be checked from other side neither soldier youth showing at during operation done however boy again stood forth pitched leaden bullet such a be used by slinger of day into window perceiving that ball be perforated secured in instant to end of clue held in hand judging that object of friend be to establish communication from side cast back to with great effort having first passed twine around mullion by aid of crispus have lowered down messenger soldier caught bullet nodded approbation with smile again receded into bush suffering slack of twine to fall down in easy curve into ravine so that double communication must scarce have be perceived even by one looking for in gathering twilight boy voice once more reached ear though form be concealed among shrubbery fear nothing be safe said can do more until after midnight when moon will give light to rescue be tranquil farewell be tranquil tranquil when life death honor infamy bliss despair hung on feeble twine scarce thicker than spider web hung on chance of

by hand will perish thenceforth be believed generally by soldier in coming struggle catiline be destined to fall by hand of paul arvina chapter xix eve of battle canst thou not minister to mind diseased macbeth nearly fortnight have elapsed since rescue of julia sad death of catiline unhappy daughter yet battle be daily hourly expected have not be fought with rare ability generalship catiline have avoided action with troop of antonius marching countermarching among rugged pass of appennines now toward rome now toward gaul keeping enemy constantly on alert harassing consul outpost threatening city with assault maintaining with studious skill appearance of mystery be so potent instrument whether to terrify to fascinate vulgar mind during period celerity of movement have be such that little host appeared to be almost ubiquitous men knew not where to look for descent how to anticipate blow evidently have in contemplation to deliver in meantime have given such of adherent a fled from rome immediately on execution of conspirator opportunity to join many have in fact done so with client band of gladiator disaffected of open country have united to having commenced operation with force not exceeding two thousand men be now at head of six time that number whom have formed into two complete legion disciplined with equal assiduity success now however time have arrived when be for advantage no longer to avoid encounter with troop of commonwealth for having gained that proposed to by dilatory movement fabian policy time namely for concentration of adherent opportunity to discipline men now began to suffer from inconvenience of system unsupplied with magazine regular supply of provision army like flight of locust have stripped country bare at halting place that wild hill country have few resource even when shorn by licentious band of desperado upon to support army consequence therefore of incessant hurrying to fro be that valley of mountain chain have made theatre of campaign be now utterly exhausted that beast of burden be broken down foundered that line of march might be traced by carcass of mule horse have given out by wayside by flight of carrion bird hovered in cloud about rear prescient of coming carnage first attempt be to elude metellus celer who have marched down from picene district on adriatic sea with great rapidity taken post at foot of mountain on head water of stream flow down into great plain of po in attempt have be frustrated by ability of officer who be opposed to who have raised no le than three legion fully equipped for war by movement of conspirator be anticipated met by corresponding measure rendered abortive be longer difficult for to penetrate design of catiline since peasantry mountaineer who have throughout district be favorable to conspiracy in first instance who be prepared to favor design promised to deliver from inexorable taxation have be by time so unmercifully plundered harassed by bandit that be now a willing to betray catiline to roman a have be desirous before of giving roman into hand at disadvantage fully aware of fact knowing farther that antonius have now come up so close to rear with large army that be in imminent danger of being surrounded taken between two fire desperate traitor suddenly took boldest perhaps wisest measure wheeling directly round turned back toward gaul whither have be marching set face toward city then making three great forced march came upon army of antonius a be in column of march among height above pistoria have there be daylight for attack when head of consul cohort be discovered be possible that might have forced to fight at disadvantage even defeated in case there must have be force capable of opposing on side rome probability must have be in favor of making master of city success must have gone far to insure triumph be late in evening however when hostile army came into presence of other on account perhaps for stronger reason catiline determined on foregoing advantage of surprise caius antonius consul in command must be remembered have be one of original confederate in catiline first scheme of massacre conflagration have be defeated by unexpected death of curius piso detached from conspiracy only by cicero rare skill disinterested cession to of rich province of macedonia antonius might therefore justly be supposed unlikely to urge matter to extremity against quondam comrade be probably in small degree on account catiline have resolved on trying chance of battle rather against old friend than against enemy so fixed of so resolute patrician principle a metellus celer thought moreover that be just within calculation of chance antonius might either purposely mismanoeuvre so a to allow to descend upon rome without battle adopt such tactic a must give victory halted army therefore in little gorge of hill opening out upon level plain flanked on left by steep acclivity of mountain towered in direction ridge above ridge inaccessible on right by rugged rocky spur jutting out from same ridge by line of battle must be rendered entirely unassailable on flank rear in wild spot amid huge gray rock hanging

defeated death only refuge for there be grand heart elevating spur to action fame to be won deathless name to be purchased name deathless already a knew too well through black infamy grateful country praise to be gained cheaply by soldier death no there be none of thing excitement be temporal sensual earthy hope to conquer lust to bask in sunshine of power desire to revel at ease in boundless

indeed bound vicious soul together community of interest of fear of peril held in league yet feeling a did feel that sole chance of safety lay in maintenance of confederation looked with evil eye upon neighbor almost hated others accusing internally of having drawn into present perilous peril of having failed at need of being swayed by selfish motif only so little truth there be in principle catiline have set forth in first address to banded parricide that community of desire dislike constitutes in one word true friendship now so darkly did destiny lower on depraved ruined spirit that even recklessness that last light emanates from crime in despair have burned out fury of conscience that conscience have so often stifled so often laughed to scorn so often drowned with riot debauch so often silenced by fierce sophistry now hunted harpy of soul worse than fabulous eumenides of parricide orestes gloomy meal be ended party separated of a must seem relieved by termination of mock festivity while brought gayity to heart imposed necessity of seeming mirthful at ease when be in truth disturbed by dark thought of past terrible foreboding of future a soon a guest have departed

camp not being much out of sling cast from rampart camp of consul lay on slope of hill so that rear be considerably higher than front catiline eye a stood on little eminence must therefore clearly discern different street division of camp by long line of lamp torch blazed along several avenue gazed anxiously long at strange silent picture with exception of slight clash clang heard at time on wall where skirmisher be going on round neigh of restless charger there be nothing must have indicated to ear that nearly twenty thousand men be sleeping among tented line of light sleeping how many of last natural slumber thought of kind however intruded on mind of desperado careless of human life reckless of human suffering gazed only with enquiring glance of profound penetration hoping to espy

perceptible about prtorium light be seen flitting to fro voice be heard calling answering to one then din of hammer sound of busy preparation might have lasted perchance hour to great amazement of traitor who must not conceive meaning of nocturnal hubbub when clang of harness succeeded by heavy regular tramp of men marching followed turmoil with many torch borne before spear eagle of cohort be seen coming rapidly toward prtorian gate by hecate cried catiline what may mean wonder be too few for assault nay even for false alarm have halted at gate by god be filing out march hitherward lo

spear head twinkling in torch light a cohort approached hill catiline fell back toward own camp little soon found shelter in small thicket of holleys wild myrtle must effectually conceal from enemy while must observe motion from safe covert on hillock cohort halted one manipule stood to arm in front while rest formed hollow square facing outward around summit torch be lowered so that with endeavor catiline must by mean discover what be in process within guarded space again din of hammer rose on ear mixed now with groan agonizing supplication waxed at length into fearful howl utterance of one past doubt in more than mortal agony strange terrible suspicion broke upon catiline sweat started in beadlike drop from sallow brow be not long ere that suspicion became certainty clang of
