in for eastern district of pennsylvania philadelphia stereotyped by george charles sansom street preface few word be perhaps needed a introduction to work of far more ambitious character than have before attempted in venturing to select subject from history of rome during earlier age undeterred by failure at best partial success of writer far more eminent than can ever hope to become have be actuated by reason in order to relieve from possible charge of presumption will state briefly have long be opinion then that there lay vast field rich with harvest of material almost virgin for romancer use in history of classic age at period when annals of century nation since christian era have be ransacked reproduced in endless variety for entertainment of hourly increasing reading world be small advantage again have fancied must discover cause for imperfect success of great writer when dealing with classic fiction in fact of endeavoring to be too learned of aiming too much at portraying greek roman too little at depicting men forgetful that under change of custom costume in country age condition human heart be still human heart convulsed by same passion chilled by same grief burning with same joy in main actuated by same hope fear with view many year ago deliberately selected subject for novel have advanced by slow step to such degree of completeness a have now attained having determined on trying success in classical fiction conspiracy of cataline appeared to theme particularly well adapted for purpose a being actual event of vast importance in many respect unparalleled in history a being partially familiar to one thoroughly understood perhaps by one so slender be authentic document concerning have come down to so dark mysterious motif of actor possessed therefore among other qualification a ground work of historical romance one almost indispensable that of indistinctness give scope to exercise of imagination without necessity of falsifying truth probability of history of execution have of course nothing to say have sedulously avoided being overlearned that few latin word will be found in work none whatsoever in conversational part none name of article have direct english appellation that be sufficiently simple direct for most unclassical reader hope that costume manner of people antiquarian detail will be found sufficiently correct if be not be not for want of pain care for have diligently consulted authority to must command access to history of strange event related in tale have adhered most scrupulously believe that date fact character of individual introduced will not be found in material respect erroneous untrue here may perhaps venture to observe on reading most recently published lecture of niebuhr never fell in way until very lately have great satisfaction of finding view have always taken of character motif of cataline confederate confirmed by opinion of profound sagacious critic historian will only add that be hardly probable that roman traitor must ever have be finished have not be for strenuous advice of friend in whose opinion have utmost confidence mr benjamin to whom of early chapter be casually shown two three year ago who almost insisted on completing be most fitting therefore that must be a be introduced to world under auspex since for favourable judgment for feeling on own part to fail in such attempt must be scarce failure while success must be success indeed must probably have never seen light of day with few remark submit roman traitor to candid judgment of friend public somewhat

then have not sent for answered other come let have knave in suppose have be robbing one hen roost want to lay blame on one else what ho chaerea a spoke word curtain covered door way be withdrawn keen witted freedman made appearance admit fellow stolo rufinus praetor be prepared to give hearing must have be difficult perhaps to have selected from whole population of rome at day more murderous looking pair of scoundrel well sirrah what secret of state have weigh so ponderously on wise thought asked lentulus with contemptuous sneer murder most noble lentulus at least subornation thereof answered one of ruffian most natural indeed must have thought a much well tell in word for be clear that nobody have murdered either of whom have murdered if have murdered one be not for lack of prompting of bribe indeed must have thought moderate bribe must have arranged matter easily come come to point whom be ye bribed instigated to get rid of speak be in haste cutler caius volero volero have cried lentulus starting indeed indeed may well be by whom then be urged to deed when paullus caecilius arvina tempted to deed by offer of ten thousand sesterces met by appointment upon caelian hill at head of minervium little before sunrise day before yesterday have for moment two fixed eye upon ground pondered deeply on what have just heard have ye seen volero since praetor heard anything concerning nothing said stolo spoke with confused air in undecided tone satisfied judge that be speaking falsely rufinus interposed however saying have noble lentulus heard say that be murdered in own booth same night having heard told not to stolo never thought about more answered rufinus doggedly seeing that have got into scrape be unfortunate somewhat strange too seeing that came hither together to speak about very man now mark volero be that night murdered appears to that be bringing accusation against young patrician in order to conceal own base handiwork in deed fellow grievously suspect wrongfully then do so answered stolo who be bolder more ready witted of two rufinus ever be forgetful fool trow be not to be brought into blame for folly well for if be not brought into more than blame now mark well can prove where be that night of murder excellent stolo ay can answered man boldly be with stout balatro fisherman helping to mend net until fourth hour boy be present helping then went to cookshop to get supper in ox forum thence at sixth hour passed across to lydia house in cyprian lane spent merry hour two carousing with jolly girl will satisfy lentulus ay if can be proved returned praetor rufinus can also show whereabout that evening can replied fellow for be sick abed that wife can show themison druggist who life in sacred way for went to get emetic at third hour be vomiting night poor hand must have made that night at murder so far then replied lentulus have cleared yourselves from suspicion charge on arvina need something more of confirmation ere dare cite patrician to plead to crime have got witness be one in sight when spoke with on minervium there be one know not if will choose to speak of who be exclaimed lentulus growing little anxious on subject for though cared little enough about arvina be yet unwilling to see patrician arraigned for so small matter a be in eye murder of mechanic why must not speak warrant will find mean to make be patron patron man cried much astonished what catiline here catiline be praetor have consulted with ere spoke with not so most noble for must not admit speak sergius be so did behold fellow in deep converse with caecilius arvina in minervium must be folly for what must have be doing there at sunrise prithee ask lentulus answered catiline with air of well feigned reluctance hate law suit judicial inquiry love young arvina then did see nay nay must speak out do adjure catiline by god be at sunrise on caelian did see arvina two be at sunrise on caelian did see heard what said face be grave earnest seemed angry a separated have in only be little thing when turn out that man be slain that same night thing grows serious therefore will detain here a witness partially suspected of slave must guard catiline will send lictor to cite paullus that appear before after session at puteal libonis be in haste farewell hear good lentulus hear exclaimed chaerea springing forward vehemence eagerness to speak a must seem ere must be interrupted chaerea cried catiline looking sternly at shaking finger remember replied chaerea will not hold peace catiline may kill if choose will speak to keep secret longer must kill tell if will answered master angrily must not be sergius interposed let man speak if have light to throw on mysterious business say on good fellow will be mediator with master freedman needed more exhortation poured out flood of eager anxious narrative a have be preconcerted between catiline speaking with so much vehemence displaying so much agitation in air gesture that entirely imposed story upon lentulus that catiline have much difficulty in restraining smile at skill of greek have be very clear said first slew slave with own hand then must have compassed nay must rather say have compassed volero slaughter who must how other have become privy to deed must have detained arrested there can be doubt of guilt people will be think disposed to make example there have of late be many case of assassination a soon a be left alone lentulus looked steadily into face of fellow conspirator for moment then burst into hoarse laugh why mummery sergius added a soon a have ceased from laughing wherefore must have mystified too might have wished to see whether evidence be like to seem valid to judices from effect upon praetor answered other be satisfied be may be so sergius for of truth until chaerea swore a did touching medon be deceived believe then that will be sufficient to secure condemnation beyond doubt will be interdicted fire water if men stick to oath only must be well perhaps to convict one of arvina slave of actual death of volero might be done easily enough there must be care taken that select one who will not be able to prove alibi wherefore be so bent on destroying youth by law too be ever perilous uncertain know too much to live without endangering others what know who slew medon who slew volero what propose to do ere long in campus answered catiline steadily by god cried lentulus turning very pale remaining silent for moment after said with thoughtful manner must be better to get rid of quietly have be tried too well failed be
