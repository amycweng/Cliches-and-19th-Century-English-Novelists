remained a still firm a though extended arm supported have be wrought in bronze iron now ranchero for such seemed to be be within forty yard of pierre when saw horse man levelled rifle when recognized being most feared on earth far famed partisan wheeling horse in instant by dint of cruel massive bit threw on haunch a if by magic terrified wretch turned to fly in direction of trooper who have gone down to southward be not probably even now more than mile distant satisfied by man flight that be unsupported pierre rapidly uncocked rifle threw to ground turning a did so to forbid gordon who have unslung carbine now half suspecting treachery in guide be raising to eye from firing not for life cried not for life cross river ride westward will deal with dog with word gathering up rein in left

levelled escopeta at partisan in moment carbine must have be discharged alarm communicated to other trooper ere must pull trigger partisan wheeled emperor by quick movement of hand thigh hurled tremendous missile a sure almost a swift a own unerring bullet aimed by eagle eye launched by master hand terrible noose of lasso encircled foreleg of mexican horse a sprang forward be drawn taut on instant by very speed of trammelled captive hurled horse rider headlong to earth with violence left for instant senseless next moment pierre leaped from saddle sprang upon captive life cried piteously in spanish life for love of god most holy virgin for charity give life senor american mount horse fool replied partisan sternly who devil do think must trouble to take miserable life a yours admonished thus man climbed awkwardly to saddle when once there be secured in seat by pierre who cutting lasso from mexican saddle fastened foot with under horse belly though not so tightly a to deprive of necessary command of animal done released arm bidding in stern quiet voice followed close silently if did not desire to be strangled leaped lightly into own saddle cantered back toward river followed by captive who took admirable care to keep so nigh to conqueror that strain of harsh cord about neck must not be drawn tighter in meantime lieutenant gordon who have first watched chase with apprehension very great anxiety lest fugitive must escape have sooner seen lasso hurled downfall of man horse than perfectly content to trust to skill judgment of man who have exhibited such readiness of thought action addressed to obey direction putting horse steadily down bank into river swam gallantly holding pistol above head in right hand in order to keep powder dry in case of future emergency before be half way across partisan came up at brisk hard canter with trembling prisoner in tow whose sword pistol escopeta threw into river then taking own pistol from holster holding aloft like gordon plunged in swam stoutly over dragging unfortunate ranchero in mortal terror after chapter iv double traitor there be need of discussion debate so evidently correct be plan of partisan have view be much more questionable than be be at probable that opposition must have be made so completely have gained confidence of whole party by promptitude gallantry extraordinary coolness in danger head of horse therefore be turned westward away rode at a rapid rate a nature of ground permitted in present order of march most danger being anticipated from rear oldest most intelligent of dragoon

nearly to margin of open ground that dragoon who acted a vidette be looking round for order pierre uttered shrill long drawn whistle be preconcerted signal for halt after rest of party have pulled up horse galloped forward till reached extreme verge of covert where without speaking single word dismounted fastening charger to tree advanced stealthily into open prairie after being absent about twenty minute during remainder of party have lost sight of altogether returned with thoughtful expression on strongly marked feature walked through little group of dragoon pack mule until reached gordon fair bride who sat on panting horse eagerly awaiting approach have heard anything asked quietly from forest in rear not sound replied young officer there be three smoke one hereaway six mile to southward now there be three plan of must choose one then act on for life death must work twenty mile due north up forest land so get above post be safest plan of if must not carry so far out of route bring far too soon into settled country quite out of line of communication must strike due southward for extinguished fire so strive to make way down to post at mier camargo must do well enough did not whole of country swarm with guerilleros again must drive right onward take chance of falling on party at little fire unawares finding a few that can master if succeed in doing so have best chance of reaching monterey in safety for once through frontier party will be likely find country clear until reach outpost risk of three then be nearly equal said gordon musing deeply immediate risk of last be greatest ultimate risk least in truth be chance anyhow gordon desired to help lady to mount replaced slender baggage on back of good horse emperor then without setting foot in stirrup laid hand

sat smoking cigarillo by fire over camp kettle filled with savory mess be simmering death shot sped bullet crashing through brain of hapless sentinel aroused brought to foot amazed terrified unprepared for action meantime dragoon crossed bridge poured down abreast receiving a came straggling volley from escopetas of lancer who seeing that flight be hopeless stood to arm like men making desperate defense then came desperate race for life death across firm dry prairie echoed under thundering horse tramp firm solid elastic mexican have perhaps gained start of fifty yard before foe be across brook small high bred horse being fresher of two held own for little way even widened gap at first between pursuer ere long however tremendous stride power of anglo american thorough bred horse began to tell at stroke partisan closed on be other slow to perceive disadvantage stood up in stirrup looked quietly behind seeing that none of dragoon have passed brook have dismounted be now grouped about fire deliberately pulled horse up unslinging escopeta took deliberate aim at pierre delacroix fired ball whizzed through air so close to head of partisan that severed one of long dark lock passed onward harmless then seeing failure of missile mexican couched long lance rode at frontier man with savage yell silently pierre charged right upon when be within horse length of spear point

danger need not have modified first expression lady replied partisan quietly a for dying thousand death can not say for certainly so far a risking one life do posse must do for willingly julia gordon be high minded artless innocent woman if ever one breathed breath of life still be woman perceived at once that have struck fascinated wild partisan at first sight though must not for universe have intentionally caused single pang did unconsciously encourage lead on to wilder more wandering fancy than have ever entertained before flatter fair lady replied with smile a dismounted from good horse
