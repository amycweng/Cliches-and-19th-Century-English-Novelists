of most bloody battle of late war desire to exterminate individual englishman extended over whole of france certain gentleman of acquaintance then very young man chanced to be passing through town in normandy where assemblage be collected outside office of mayor arose from very uncommon circumstance that functionary have be appealed to by post captain in english navy to punish bullying frenchman who have striven to fasten quarrel upon although entirely unprovoked on part now day captain must have be held to have behaved rightly enough perhaps in fire eating time honest man life be at mercy of worthless ruffian who chose to run equal risk with from powder bullet decision wonderful to relate be given by mayor against compatriot crowd be correspondingly enraged friend whose nationality be apparent be hustled ill treated one person well dressed evidently of good position knocked hat off observing at same time will complain of to mayor for certainly not returned young englishman quietly picking hat up broken muddy from trampled ground will treat very differently will fight will come challenge let fight to morrow morning exclaimed bully who be a turned out notorious provincial

thus be marmaduke heath above relation be clumsy method of proving courageous be well aware really know not otherwise how to make appear so slave a be seen be to terror must seem almost imaginary be said that man however fearless quite get over awe of schoolmaster exaggeration of sentiment probably possessed unfortunate young man added to be fact that sir massingberd be uncle family tie be doubtless not without influence notwithstanding marmaduke evil opinion of own race suspect too entertained morbid notion that own life that of relative be somehow bound up together in one on few occasion when ever saw moved to wrath similarity mental a well a physical between uncle became apparent actually inspired with sort of awe hatred of noble mind more injured misshapen by ill training be impossible to imagine for last few month however a have said have be growing aright gaining strength vigour home even mr clint tutor felt must possibly be better adapted for than present one society of mr gerard man independent almost to audacity despising haughty strong with supreme contempt be very tonic needed rarely however be uncle name mentioned in presence at first mr gerard have purposely spoken of sir massingberd lightly jestingly be found that subject have better be altogether avoided be ill to jest upon earthquake with one who having just recovered from certain shock of volcanic nature be not without apprehension of more to come anticipation turned out to be too well grounded day two after discovery of baronet poor gipsy wife at fairburn whose existence be well known found to rector mr clint of course to marmaduke postman carried misfortune from to harley street although be a unconscious of fact a marmaduke did not come in to luncheon from study a usual mr gerard

morning mr gerard found poor lad with eye riveted upon autograph be not mine upon word must rather have cut off hand than knowingly have sent nephew marmaduke be told whether falsely not doe not matter now that have not seen letter previously sent to think can scarcely have done so must not have dared to disobey order therein contained must have returned to fairburn long ago at event will read with own eye beware how hesitate to comply with return hither sir at once be idle to suppose that wish harm a be with must fain persuade be far worse than idle to attempt to cross will come back to fairburn will behave towards a though have not acted in late undutiful manner delay to do so be sure that will still have to return under very different circumstance marmaduke heath must know well by time when say 'come be bad for person to whom speak to reply ' will not come ' give twenty four hour to arrive here after receipt of letter when have elapsed without seeing will consider absence to be equivalent to contumacious refusal then war will begin between strife will be unequal nephew marmaduke although have fifty men at back like lawyer clint man gerard must not keep from arm will reach wheresoever be at time least suspect from quarter to have least looked however well may seem to be with will not be well when think safest will be most in danger there be indeed one place of safety for come home massingberd heath wily baronet have fooled doubtless when rose to light taper have substituted above letter for have persuaded to enclose to unhappy nephew chapter iii before blow a yet in ignorance of mischief have unwittingly done to dearest friend must not wonder why received news from harley street have confessed to mr long what sir massingberd have persuaded to do although have thought wrong to have acted without consulting in matter anticipated evil consequence rather sought to laugh out of own foreboding presentiment still there be somewhat suspicious corroboration of that newborn courtesy of formidable neighbour have suddenly ceased a though end for have be used be already attained baronet manner towards be a surly a ever even trifle more so a if to recompense for

know pretend to entertain regard towards late pupil marmaduke regard be genuine sir massingberd wish others entertained like who be more nearly connected with than by bond of pupil tutor pray put out of question returned baronet coolly what have to say concern others not like lad wish well hope for unclouded future trust that character of family will be redeemed in virtuous hand that remembrance of what have be will not cleave to will gradually die out be earnest desire replied mr long gravely be glad to hear continued other suppose mr clint cherishes similar notion man gerard rebel hypocrite

heard spoken by such lip well well returned have nothing to say against young woman be probable however will allow attachment may arise between nephew grant that do ah thought so in case mr gerard must prefer husband of daughter to be free from stain good there be three person then at least interested in nephew good name now listen know something parson of mode of life pursued by heath from generation to generation know something of deed have be committed at fairburn hall what be known however be honourable harmless compared to what be not known vice have shuddered at be mere folly

came upon be of small consequence circumstance will never forget after event have made one of most memorable in life for be last time save one ever beheld massingberd heath little did think what

if mr clint must not be induced to give pecuniary help chapel must be built tutor who have very orthodox abhorrence of dissent especially when threatened own parish be exceedingly disturbed by intelligence what cried preach to nephew doctrine of conservatism sir massingberd yet be induced for wretched bribe to let nest of sectary be built in very avenue of park be terrible indeed quoth baronet drily might set up opposite front door for extra five pound note announce offer solely on account call on to morrow for final decision can not afford to say 'no now can do what please with mr clint may surely represent to that be case where twenty pound may be well expended matter will thus be staved off for year at least next year know may be in better circumstance dead many person must greatly prefer certainly returned tutor gravely will do best with mr clint in meantime rather than let chapel be built will advance money mention at own risk happen to have considerable sum in house

of murder of certain lieutenant of coast guard by smuggler on east coast how oppressed treated with unnecessary cruelty for many many month until at last took away out of bed by force carried man knew whither put to death with torture yes returned perfectly well buried poor wretch up to neck in sea sand bowled stone at head well peter that frightful scene be constantly representing whenever shut eye only head be that of sir massingberd can not imagine how distressing be to now to go to bed with expectation of re enacting before can get to sleep dear how dreadful returned doe not fact of only recognizing victim convince of unreality of thing if knew face of smuggler then indeed do know peter interrupted tutor gravely be worst of although must a say rather convince of imaginary character of scene since actor in have long be dead gone believe be not smuggler gipsy there be on carew in particular one unhappy man into whose history need not enter who once incurred baronet vengeance be afraid be too likely perished in consequence be sad story of deception on side be certain that sir massingberd richly earned hatred of wandering people have right of course to make such charge peter can not help thinking that be who have made away with squire casually inquired in village yesterday about tribe generally inhabit fir grove on crittenden road seems left place by night on about very

doing so with safety sight however of covered cart placed a seemed jealously in very centre of encampment be too much for mr long who to do justice be a bold a lion except where conventional position

closed by penny piece in time in sun offered reward of one hundred guinea for tidings of missing baronet in spite of bow street runner depreciating remark upon point be effort in direction wholly thrown away full description of sir massingberd have appeared in above newspaper for ten successive day on eleventh following information came of be breakfasting in harley street mr long having come up from fairburn previous day when butler informed that there be man waiting in hall who wished to see hg who have put certain advertisement into sun newspaper show in here at once george mr gerard

ushered in who bowed to in very decorous unassuming fashion be attired in half mourning carried little black leather bag umbrella latter le common companion in day than cane be now a though have just come off journey have called gentleman said simply in consequence of seeing notice respecting disappearance of certain individual of whose whereabouts be in position to inform be sir massingberd heath alive sir gasped marmaduke heaven be praised be sir responded stranger fervently umph ejaculated mr gerard with le piety mr long coughed behind finger otherwise kept discreet silence know do sir inquired host know well enough by sight if at least advertised description of personal appearance be accurate resumed visitor height beard curious indentation upon forehead be characteristic of man whom saw last night whom have seen day for week be living under name of daneton at village in cambridgeshire near reside have not slightest doubt whatever of identity a for knowing except by sight however can not say that do without meaning offence wishing to hurt feeling of relation may observe that mode of life be scarcely one to make acquaintance with advantageous if may speak without reserve upon matter must state that drank considerably to extent indeed landlord of inn have informed of at least bottle half of french brandy per diem must be uncle observed marmaduke naively be so sir without doubt continued stranger seek for pecuniary reward having seen advertisement thought duty to come up relieve feeling of anxious relative here door opened mr townshend walked in unannounced a be custom to do merely nodding to a though be inmate of house sat down at table with back to visitor helped to roll butter mr gerard explained briefly stranger errand to officer of justice then observed be to understand then that have be so good a to come way from nutgall expressly to give information sir responded man with frankness must deceive if be to say that much have business in city to day arrived so far by coach came on hither merely few mile beyond mark be for be indebted to be great deal observed mr long warmly take very kindly that must have done so much thought only duty sir replied visitor modestly trouble take into account what pity gentleman did not think of writing by post observed mr townshend still proceeding with breakfast must have saved long expedition many day of anxiety be very true returned stranger fact be one doe not always like to answer advertisement in way how did know who ' be thought also that personal interview must be more satisfactory be poor man did not grudge chance of losing hour two on errand of charity be very good answered marmaduke gloomily must please permit added mr long taking out purse to at least reimburse for loss of time seems to observed mr townshend speaking with mouth full that gentleman be about to be rather hardly dealt by be true that guinea even one may repay for lost time if intelligence respecting sir massingberd heath turn out to be such a represents will be entitled to hundred guinea reward never thought of observed mr long returning purse to pocket not without blush hope sir that will acquit of sordid design in what proposed to do most certainly sir returned stranger with animation indeed view a just expressed be quite in accordance with own have wish whatever for reward in question to have done duty be sufficient recompense for on other hand can not well afford to lose two three hour have be expended in service couple of guinea must quite repay for even leave obligation upon side there be silence for little during mr long gazed inquiringly at mr gerard in turn looked towards mr townshend then a though back of gentleman head have be cognizant that counsel be demanded of bow street runner spoke a follows must be nothing le than fraud in opinion if good gentleman generosity be taken advantage of in way suggests if management of business be to be in hand must say let behave with rectitude at least if not with liberality hundred guinea be fairly if be correct in what have told whereas if be not correct since mistake can have occurred in matter by own showing why be merely attempt to extort money under false pretence really mr townshend cried tutor starting to foot think profession of thief catching make very unscrupulous in imputation for own part felt excessively indignant too so think must marmaduke have done have not be preoccupied with own thought lucy blushed cast down eye father quietly observed mr townshend may have be somewhat plain spoken what have said be common sense if will be good enough to leave address at nutgall with sir will communicate with a soon a have convinced ourselves of truth of suspicion then will not only have compensation apology to offer very good sir rejoined visitor coolly address be upon card if have known sort of reception awaited here must not perhaps have be so anxious to do duty gentleman wish good day be sorry to have interrupted repast mention good sir observed bow street runner a disposed of third slice of ham have treated a stranger assure to sarcasm visitor made reply bowing to rest of company be about to withdraw with polite severity when mr long stepped forward took by hand believe be kindly hearted man cried who have be grievously wronged by whom have attempted to benefit in case can not do harm to have shaken hand with honest man one who be humble minister of gospel must have jumped up shaken hand with stranger also false shame prevented thought that townshend be only waiting for poor fellow to go to become contemptuously cynical upon who have shown belief in bow street runner however said never word proceeded with interminable breakfast mr long be speechless with indignation saw lucy gerard cast approving glance at excellent tutor then imploring one towards father who be biting lip a if to restrain laughter at last rector broke silence gather from what have stated mr townshend that will scarcely consider while to go down to make further inquiry into circumstance of have just heard will certainly not be worth while returned bow street runner curtly then will go down into cambridgeshire observed tutor very good sir if time be le valuable to must give great deal of pleasure to accompany dear peter remarked tutor taking notice of wicked banter what do say to coming with even if have be le disposed to do than be must still have readily consented to be rector travelling companion for to refuse must have be to declare upon enemy side accordingly set off upon amateur detective expedition very day on following evening returned to harley street having possessed ourselves of important information that benevolence be sometimes assumed for base purpose of making few shilling that advertisement be occasionally taken advantage of to confusion of who insert there be really village called nutgall be one fact that respectable person in half mourning have brought along with black leather bag silk umbrella there be not public house in place where sir massingberd must have procured that bottle half of french brandy have be ever so disposed to dissipation even where must get bread cheese verily believe at time of disenchantment revered tutor must rather that baronet have be really at nutgall in humour condition to wage implacable war against poor marmaduke than have given opportunity of triumph to man of bow street chapter xiii better than blunderbuss be runner custom to call at mr gerard evening matter how often might have be there during day in order to report progress that there be none when knock at front door be heard perceived rector wince upon chair like one who have be roasted little already expects to be before fire again immediately mr townshend however did not even so much a allude to will o ' wisp pursuit cautioned perhaps not to do so by host besought by daughter a fancy think that gravity of intelligence brought with must of have blunted mr townshend appetite for acrimonious jesting be insatiable indeed issue of death life of lost found formed so much ordinary business of life that discovery matter of what nature disturbed a little a finding gentleman with head off disturbs king of dahomey well mr long be glad to see back again said be very man want doe farmer of name of arabel happen to reside in near parish life at fairburn within stone throw will never make bow street runner interrupted mr townshend shaking head well then continued tutor good humouredly if accuracy be so essential will say within mile few yard of own rectory be better sir returned detective gravely what sort of character do consider man to bear mr arabel be honest man good churchman replied rector positively for little occasional excess drunkard eh observed bow street officer briskly certainly not mr townshend take too much liquor now then believe regret to say there be few more sober person in parish than richard arabel indeed observed other reflectively yet be man who paid to mr vanderseld who trade in grain have heard from hamburg have traced note back again to fairburn start for place evening by post chaise if mr meredith want lift will be happy to take one of along with intelligence astonished immensely tutor who knew farmer more than rest such news must have be sufficient to have taken rector home at once besides be not only anxious a usual to get back to own parish somewhat grudged long continued absence intellectual holiday there did not seem too to be sort of necessity for remaining longer with marmaduke who have found be impossible to doubt companion far more capable of upholding encouraging than bow street runner offer be therefore accepted by of in few hour took seat in same vehicle for midshire chaise be a roomy one a must be procured still a there be one seat have to assume position of bodkin between two companion conversation be at first entirely confined to subject of expedition namely farmer arabel concerning whom detective expressed suspicion more darkly more extravagantly be eulogized by mr long so vehement be dispute did not like to interrupt for considerable period during endured great inconvenience from sitting upon substance at once sharp hard contained in one of mr townshend pocket if have be lady of present day must have known what be perhaps have modestly suffered on without remonstrance since be not of softer sex certainly did not wear crinoline ventured to ask what be inflicted such torture beg pardon young gentleman observed bow street runner removing article objected to be only sitting upon pair of bracelet with may have perhaps to present mr richard arabel mean to say that carry handcuff in pocket observed tutor with shudder of disgust mean to say do must a soon think of moving about without a without hat breech returned runner with coolness froze into protracted silence rain fell heavily a night drew on dashed against streaming pane with fitful violence wind wet poured in together whenever window be put down to pay postboys pitied poor fellow exposed to such weather be glad to see that mr townshend paid liberally there be person who be more open handed traveller than bow street runner observed mr long when remarked to upon circumstance in absence of friend who have stepped out while be changing horse somewhere for brandy water reason of generosity be that other people have to pay for have never heard tutor utter so severe speech gathered from that indignation against fellow wayfarer be a poignant a ever yet within hour be fated that resentment must be neutralized by gratitude leaving large margin of latter sentiment over above next stage be over desolate treeless heath where element have own way against more than ever vehicle seemed actually to shrink shudder from force of onslaught of sudden be thrown forward against opposite window by stoppage of postchaise at first thought horse have fallen immediately afterwards window next to mr long be violently pushed down from without something black small be pistol be protruded into carriage money life come be quick curse keep gentleman waiting in wet said rough voice be quick say volley of oath accompanied unpleasant request have only couple of guinea with cried mr long quietly will not make more by swearing be lie remarked voice very uncivilly for be parson be have always money enough ai parson postboy did say so when asked who 'd got inside there come here wo yer at word one of wretched postboys shivering dripping came forward to

distinctness if have happened to know boy have informed gentleman of circumstance be sure must never have stopped unless indeed be to inquire after health at same time thrust broad face out of window
