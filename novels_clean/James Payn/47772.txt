mirk man can bring very likely robert returned young lady little disconcerted at involuntary remark having be overheard let hope will have good news must scarcely have thought be necessary to have gone well be not so sure miss mr rudd post mistress at dalwynch be great stickler for form might have made difficulty particularly a did not obtain place through influence whose influence robert ours miss to be sure lisgard interest see be given last election to losing side although time be can well recollect when poor sir robert have everything of sort at disposal be vacant in part yallers have gone spoilt time with sigh of regret for golden age of patronage shake of head directed against levelling opinion at present in ascendant mr robert went off to breakfast sooner have wheel of chariot began to move than lady lisgard observed to companion have letter with dictated last night have not yes lady here be though not sealed down in case might have thought of anything to add mary said mistress perusing there be nothing here that can better by thought although spent night in thinking over refusal must scarce be made shorter more decided than there be not trace of vacillation to give most sanguine suitor hope then a if other idea be expressing almost in spite of added do not look deadly pale mary very white worn madam a well may bad enough for people to observe who did not know cause for people madam saw sharp enough if mean lady waiting maid made significant gesture in direction of miss rose aynton nothing escape bless nothing sooner be out of house under present circumstance indeed under circumstance in opinion better never liked from first mary said mistress in tone of one who argues against own conviction must not be uncharitable in judgment of others particularly a respect young folk often set down a serious fault what in be only thoughtlessness miss aynton be none of sort lady always think before speaks take good long look before leap for seems a though butter must not melt in mouth be a full o ' scheme a cat at dairy door if there be cream to be got in world will get lady will go bail let butter milk fall to whose share will confess ca quite understand said lady musing be sure when first came seemed simple unobtrusive enough while on other hand in manner towards of late downright impudence call lady in such chit a well say that be certainly not so respectful a might be will be sorry to send back to london just a summer be beginning to live with cross old aunt whom appears to dislike so confess think have be here long enough much too long lady much too long answered mr forest gravely have set more people in house by ear than wot of while anne rees who used to be miss letty maid one must think miss aynton be mistress now so entirely have got under thumb have ferreted out folly of anne heaven know how did what be girl slave from whom did learn that be starting at hour again why be not miss letty told a well a miss rose do suppose must have let anybody else make coffee for mamma if have be aware of departure then miss aynton will take credit to herself for not permitting miss letty to be called fatigue herself by getting up so early nasty sly young hussy be just way uncommon civil kind attentive until get upper hand find under thumb then begin to know have found out in servant hall although make fool of old robert yet actually told that at last dinner party at abbey thought most distinguished looking person in room only wait till catch afternoon at madeira then will be obedient humble servant without having more pretty speech be bad bold girl ma'be let be ten time lady born here mistress forest indignantly tossing head back without making due allowance for bonnet came into sharp contact with back of chariot severely bit tongue lady be thereby enabled to interpose remark why have not told word of before mary must never have permitted guest of mine particularly young lady to whom stand in relation of guardian while be under roof first to ingratiate with servant then to tyrannise over in way describe never heard of anything more atrociously mean think have be wanting in duty let alone personal regard for mary to have concealed matter so long begging pardon lady have nobody to blame for observed waiting maid with asperity only harsh word ever spoke to be about certain of mr welsh doings of complained with reason though wish to refer to now what said be 'never abuse affectionate relation in two stand mary by causing to side with against fellow servant can deny nothing vex with talebearing hate vulgar gossip despise who bring ' after setting down like that be not likely must give tongue about miss aynton way let know how have made anne rees spy upon mind own business mary forest say have minded lady ever since be angry with friend returned lady lisgard sadly daresay be wrong even if not have heart to argue with now wonder poor dear assented waiting maid greatly mollified be brute to bring up against just now in trouble be right time perhaps to speak about miss aynton going on only said manner be not quite what used to be be so afraid that might be getting lady under thumb how must possibly be mary surely can not have slightest suspicion of sniff something lady must not have be making coffee morning however let sniff only be very careful to lock desk when want to say anything to about know who come out of earshot of keyhole of own door ah must though know better thief did say thief although for matter of have mind to steal from be much mistaken something value most on earth son there now have said waiting maid drew very long breath a though oppressive weight be off mind at last evidently expected mistress to express astonishment if not horror be positively disappointment to when lady replied calmly know about mary be doing miss aynton wrong might have be daughter in law if liked yet to certain knowledge refused to be so refused most certainly did son made offer in presence rejected here be at dalwynch tell wiggins to stop at post office thank heaven there be plenty of time to spare how heart doe beat waiting maid pulled check string delivered mistress order quite mechanically without knowing what said in spite of importance of what have now so immediately to do mind be entirely occupied with wonder of what have just heard

that one of own sex must reject man who be not already married to somebody else here be post office mary mind speak very civilly to woman make haste will be in perfect fever till see come back with dreadful letter safe in hand one minute two minute three minute seeming hour to lady shrinking in corner of chariot while omnibus to station passed repassed picking up knew not what passenger bearing

post office palisade gave sign of gracious welcome from out pigeon hole through distributed stamp word poured forth in undiminished stream of denial severity nay doubt whether presence of lady did not intensify bitterness of tone importance may be to to get letter mistress forest cried addressing poor mary who be looking very disconsolate not little angry also be of much greater moment to that must

awe whom loved feared with strength of energetic nature be husband walter lisgard chapter x letter upon morning after interview between rose lady lisgard latter again sent down mistress forest for post bag be once more disappointed at receiving news from arthur haldane not only did interval of twenty four hour make matter additionally serious increase former apprehension that have not received telegram might find mean of forwarding derrick letter to since have certainly not come back to lisgard arm there be still graver cause for anxiety in fact that mary forest also received reply from ralph to rejection so decidedly yet courteously composed by mistress with view of taking away hope at same time of leaving a little sting of anger a be possible lady lisgard must have almost preferred to have received from man declaration of open warfare expressed resolution of carrying away mary a wife in spite of obstacle rather than menacing answer contemptuous silence be not at natural line for one of violent character to take if have decided to treat waiting woman letter a final be more likely in case to have penned tornado of invective bidden mistress maid to have gone to devil seemed only too probable then that be determined a have threatened to take denial that must return in person sooner later to mirk to prosecute suit lady made certain preparation for extremity nay for worst must possibly arise chief among be composition of very long carefully conned epistle to eldest son that put by in desk undated unsealed so that addition must be made to at pleasure then waited in agony of suspense day after day yet letter came for maid from ralph for from arthur haldane moreover although in absorbing anxiety about more serious subject affected lady far le than did rose communication came from walter in answer to long justificatory letter acquainting with disclosure of marriage reader be aware that last circumstance be simply due to fact that be reposing in address box of turf

capable of being put out to very considerable extent very marriage with although fortunately did not know have be mainly owing to impatience of opposition pique against elder brother doubtless propinquity opportunity of flirtation with beautiful accomplished girl not by mean lavish of smile whose devotion to have be almost that of slave for master have carried handsome captain towards gulf of matrimony be desire to thwart sir richard who jealous eye perceived be falling seriously in love with rose long before saw be final cause of rash act eagerly snatched at occasion at once of self gratification of humiliating proud arrogant brother be delighted to let know that wealth title must weigh in balance of woman favour against gift grace be habit to depreciate ignore have said that discovered sir richard passion even before object of rose subtle brain be already preoccupied with to give that scheming beauty due think that even have not be already walter wife must not have exchanged for baronet at period when made that dazzling offer in library felt that have let slip splendid prize be proportionally angry with sir richard whose backwardness hauteur have prevented from recognising possibility of falling to lot feeling of disappointment be transient be bride of only few week to get disenchanted of one like walter lisgard be long process even for wife by time however though idolised still rose have learned to fear absolutely dared not pen letter to inquire reason of silence of who waited sick at heart for coming of postman morning lady lisgard therefore be first to lose patience wrote to arthur haldane few urgent line requesting immediate presence at mirk upon private particular business within hour of receipt took train appeared in person at abbey lady have decided to consult in preference to father respecting arrangement necessary to be made for future maintenance of walter wife since must be very unwise to make so much importance of matter concerning derrick about be in reality vastly more concerned burned to know truth what be matter ma mre inquired tenderly when not without exercise of address for sir richard be always hospitable especially in absence of brother gracious attentive to guest arthur lady have managed to get hour to in boudoir look very pale anxious yes arthur have enough to make so walter have secretly made rose aynton wife ah

thousand can ask to help walter wife must walter take even if brother be generous enough to offer sir richard be quite capable of such magnanimity ma mere unless be much mistaken in character must not like to see brother even be lisgard let alone so near kith kin in position must be discreditable to family while if one have really loved woman one surely doe not wish to see poor struggling simply because have preferred one else a for walter accepting help brother can so well spare may be little bitter in opinion must be far preferable to receiving what must impoverish mother arrangement propose must leave three hundred pound year yes answered lady hastily require that for purpose else sum must easily suffice present need must hing of sort ma mre come let be reasonable if will leave matter in hand will endeavour to be mediator between son sir richard have honest regard for think walter also when be poor walter murmured lady sighing yes be to be pitied answered other drily also

send fact be accepted that person by letter what be name of whom spoke together time ago at watersmeet afterwards persuaded by acting in accordance with suggestion remember decided to refuse first letter be unfortunately posted before second be written postmistress at dalwynch positively refused to give up although drove over there to request well upon life ma mre be bold woman exclaimed young lawyer laughing why of course must give up must be stealing property of postmaster general if have done so must be receiver with guiltiest knowledge well at event did not pursued lady simply must hing beyond directing envelope afresh to address honest creature interrupted arthur grimly under circumstance telegraphed to knowing that must be good enough to destroy letter directly reached yes ma mere did so returned arthur gravely feared be not right now that have told know that be wrong may have have reason dear lady lisgard doubtless very urgent one to wish destruction of letter letter exclaimed lady yes be certain of course that intended harm to one that what did be in ignorance of law so suspicious be of having transgressed at same time perhaps little annoyed that must have chosen lady lisgard for instrument in such matter purposely omitted to communicate with to put in writing evidence whatsoever of transaction yes yes said lady hastily taking notice of young man evident annoyance speak of letter there be only one letter directed to pump court there be two lady lisgard addressed in same handwriting word turf hotel piccadilly be crossed out also in case remember in red ink be

always to be thinking of morrow must soon go mad chapter xi mr arthur haldane make useful writer be very fond of describing interview between betrothed person there be undoubtedly reader who take pleasure in reading such delicate detail yet seems strange that must be so with respect to mre description of what in real life be undoubtedly tame stupid to looker on for what can be duller more uninteresting except to one than engaged couple with what meaningless emphasis smile what mysterious secret known to adult in company interchange how go blindly feeling after one hand under table whenever opportunity offer think even profane to mention such tender mystery arthur haldane letty lisgard be not indeed betrothed couple when met upon present occasion became so before parted subject of conversation being marriage of somebody else naturally enough strayed to own be not good match for letty just at present said young man frankly during lucid interval despair of removing disparity of fortune be getting on in profession better than must have hoped for see why 'disparity ' of sort dear arthur must affect person who really love one own sweet letty replied other relapsing then family exertion of mine can procure for pedigree a can boast of be matter of genuine congratulation arthur dear richard often make wish that there be such thing a ancestor suppose be dreadful heresy seems to so strange that people be not taken for what be let birth be what will rose of radical exclaimed young man with admiration word deserve to be written in letter of gold so saying took out pocket book in spite of opposition transcribed then there of what possible good can that be dear foolish fellow can not say for certain letty answered gravely keep thing long enough use will come folk say mr arthur haldane have a be aware other interview awaiting le agreeable than one on hand perhaps may account for prolonging to inordinate length there be difference of opinion expressed in one what be unusual in argument between sex lady have not last word at parting strictly speaking have farewell of expired almost at same instant be not breathed into ear at say almost advisedly from desire to be accurate for if imprint kiss upon other cheek can not do quite coincidently be certain if statistic of matter must be collected that nine engaged couple for of course couple doe who be not engaged out of ten do salute one in way not press lip to lip a poet make out in fact requires particular uniform conformation of nose must be snub to render thing practicable sir richard whom have be compelled occasionally to represent in unfavourable light did not fall short in interview with arthur haldane of high estimate latter have formed of chivalric nature perhaps be through overweening pride must not permit woman upon whom affection have once condescended to rest to be inconvenienced by narrow circumstance actuated by motive behaviour towards rash young couple be liberal in extreme accepted very willingly explanation given by young lawyer with great tact of refusal by rose aynton utterance be given to remark that if have pressed suit little earlier doubtless thought of younger brother must have entered girl brain suggestion be somehow other delicately conveyed in gilead there be balm strange a may appear object of rejected suit seemed to have won forgiveness not only for herself for husband to whose fault have heretofore shewn so unfraternally alive certainty did not request arthur to offer congratulation to young benedict sent by conciliatory message special request that captain mr lisgard must not fail to visit abbey upon occasion of approaching fte period of own coming of age must be very fitting one for newly married pair to introduce to people of country while presence at time must evidence that there be family breach in there be doubtless leaven of selfishness there be considerable magnanimity also manner in baronet spoke of rose must have done honour to bayard in matter must be even conceded that shewed more nobility of spirit than lady of household mother have forgiven girl after fashion be true feeling towards be anything genial one heart can not be made to yearn towards sly deceitful young person just because happens to be one daughter in law pity for walter be great did not beget love for with letty again rose stood even lower perhaps seemed to do so from higher eminence have previously occupied in affection of school friend young lady who have sworn eternal friendship doe not relish discovery that other party to solemn transaction have be making fool of under own roof for month nay have be systematically deceiving upon matter mutual confidence concerning form very basis of such compact namely beloved object young men encourage one to communicate honest love secret although be boastful enough of conquest over sex where there be pretence of heart being concerned with young lady sort of information be most prized of there be tacit if not expressed understanding between female friend that first genuine attachment formed by will at once be revealed to other expectation of tender avowal be what be uppermost in mind whenever meet when have be made what endless subject of sympathy doe unconscious swain become between devoted young person how quality of mind be canvassed colour of hair how religious principle be eulogised also small foot how in short betrothed faithful confidante construct mental physical ideal for jones out of what have read of admirable crichton apollo belvedere betty lisgard be a good girl in opinion a ever drew breath be human when kissed rose first time after learned have become sister be by mean impassioned salute have used to be have dear although delivered with emphasis at genuine ring a for other female at abbey be fortunate for rose that have not to apply to for character for although mistress forest knew place better than to circulate scandal miss anne rees no longer restrained by terror of constabulary indemnified for previous reticence by favouring fellow servant with very curious detail indeed with respect to mr walter lisgard lady proposal that rose must take advantage of mr arthur haldane escort on morrow to aunt house until must receive husband direction a to future place of abode be think very generally welcomed felt to be relief by whole house during long railway journey to town however made agreeable enough to companion a be well able to do when so disposed to sex young barrister be prudent sagacious beyond year what knew of lady behaviour did not certainly prepossess in favour nevertheless be obliged to confess to although omitted to do so to letty mr walter lisgard be very charming person be undeniable that married woman may make herself twice a pleasant for short interval like railway journey a single one can do be not afraid of being considered too forward of laying out to captivate while if be bachelor with whose tendresse for fair one be acquainted will take under patronage notwithstanding that may be twice age so sympathise with identify with absent intended that be half inclined to squeeze hand cover with kiss mr arthur haldane have much too judicial mind to give way to impulse of kind be very nice to hear rose eulogise darling letty protest that man who married must find united with angel quite forgot under soothing treatment that impression on leaving abbey be that two young lady be not very good friend did occur to at that privilege of matronly talk be being exercised by bride not two month wedded whose surreptitious marriage have only be discovered about week ago when have reached london be approaching aunt residence in late afternoon found suddenly in broad stream of vehicle for most part furnished with four horse very unlike usual spick span london equipage being covered with white dust bearing trace of recent rapid travel quite forgot be derby day exclaimed arthur be gentleman of road daresay husband be among rose turned quite pale leaning back in cab did not again look out of window until arrived at aunt door where two companion parted very good friend indeed rose gave little sigh a thanked for escort went not indeed to young man heart good way too hope master walter doe not ill treat that poor girl soliloquised arthur a drove away be almost certain that s afraid of london after derby be more like pandemonium even than on night before winner be wild with joy inclined for sort of dissipation loser also crave for circean cup that may temporarily forget misfortune with unusual roar of wheel hoof in street there mix still more unusual shouting from open window of place of entertainment there stream forth tangled talk be confined within door at other time before arthur must reach turf hotel learned from source without further inquiry that king have won race in consequence of mischance having happened to jockey of menelaus knew therefore that walter lisgard have lost money still when upon reaching lodging first set eye upon young dragoon moodily stretched upon sofa with eye staring straight before face a pale a tablecloth on stood untasted meal be astonished shocked for moment rigidity be there about exquisite feature arthur thought with shudder that be dead even after entered room lit only from glaring street not limb stirred not muscle moved to mark consciousness of presence when exclaimed walter what be matter man figure leapt up with cry of pleasure took hand in be glad to see arthur cried be very kind of deserve thought be that infernal scoundrel derrick be not here then no may have come gone for know for believe have be in sort of nightmare only be horse caused derrick partner derrick for what know sold race know what be going to

loaded pistol with must be most friendly action must do just now believe walter must not talk like answered arthur very gravely for there be look in friend eye seemed to harmonise only too well with despairing word when kill so philosophically forget how wound others by selfish act think of mother lad yes must be sorry must not must break heart walter be besides have wife now yes know be forgiven why have not written to in answer to letter wrote none of can imagine only got very day groaned walter be in fit state to write upon business think business echoed arthur contemptuously be in fit

state of case now do not think that kindest office friend must do must be to help with mean of blowing out what must be in man brain for not only do recognise scoundrel a senseless dolt idiot fool of first quality must owe then near seven thousand pound interrupted arthur with something like groan just about so far a have dared to look thing in face lost within twenty four hour most of within three minute must keep from mother somehow walter have be sadly tried doubt whether must bear must know sooner later man even if doe read in paper when turf gentry get paid make noise about see that
