so like margaret murmured talk of town chapter xix discovery illustration when folk be not in accord especially if there be fear on one side communication of kind be difficult enough personal companionship be well nigh unendurable often often in evening not so long ago william henry have hesitated to come in on father very doorstep turned away into wet wind swept street rather than thrust unwelcome companionship upon not seldom in day between death of wife margarets coming to norfolk street mr erin have left supper table without word sought own chamber hour before time rather than endure sight of boy whose very existence be reproach to who have have ill taste to survive own beloved child who have not pleasure pursuit in common with now however be changed nothing be more significant of alteration in old man feeling towards william henry than satisfaction took in society so close attachment young man might well have dispensed with since kept sometimes from margaret nevertheless be far from discouraging since knew that such familiarity tended in end to ensure to be antiquary whimor perhaps thought that association of idea might help to incline young man heart towards himto read at night shakespeare play with a have be wont to do when william henry be yet child coldness have a yet sprung up between at time young fellow attention must flag little thought must fly after heart be upstairs in margarets keeping a rule shared seemed to share old man enthusiasm comment suggestion on text be always received with respect considering what must have be fate have be hazarded six month ago be almost ludicrous such illogical change in personal estimation be not unexampled even in modern time there have be instance where sudden acquisition of wealth unexpected succession to title have invested astonished possessor with attribute in way connected with rank rich in present case admiration expressed be however remarkable because very quality of literary judgment like be now acknowledged have be of old contemptuously ignored william henry who have never ignored be content to find recognised at last by mean exchanged view upon character of hamlet with antiquary with cheerful confidence upon equal term one night be reading lear together have come to line wherein duke offer kent administration of kingdom to kent reply have journey sir shortly to go master call must not say no do not think sir observed william henry that couplet be somewhat inappropriate to occasion how so inquired antiquary be noteworthy that took objection with such mildness notion of anything in shakespeare being inappropriate be like suggesting to fire worshipper that there be spot on sun well sir strike a somewhat too brief trivial considering subject on speaks now what do think of by way of emendation drew from pocket slip of paper on following line be written in own handwriting thanks sir go to unknown land chain pilgrim fast within soil by living men most shunned most dreaded still good master same journey took call be content straight obey then farewell world busy scene be done kent lived most true kent died most like man antiquary face be study few month ago be doubtful whether anything from william henry pen must have obtained so much a patient consideration of son genius mr erin have always thought very little esteemed indeed more worthy of title of man of letter than friend mr talbot production be now on very different plane demanded best attention such admiration a be possible to give still good master same journey took call be content straight obey murmured be harmonious natural certain simplicity pervades yes lad be creditable venture to think said young man deferentially that opening line thanks sir go to unknown land c be not devoid of merit devoid certainly not devoid courteous in expression andumto point somewhat modern in tone without speaking with smile full of significance young man produced roll of paper laid before companion great heaven what be exclaimed mr erin straightening out manuscript with trembling finger while devoured with eye be something that hoped to find at stratfordat clapton house returned william henry quietly how often have told that manuscript of shakespeare play must need be in existence somewhere be right be original at event very early manuscript of lear lear shakespeare lear dear samuel take breath away yet handwriting seems incontestable here be jug watermark clear proof at least of antiquity have read of course doe differ from quarto yes materially thank heaveni mean how extraordinary one can hardly indeed wish line of shakespeare to differ from what be already engraven in heart still to get first thought truly rapturous day rather think sir said william henry that after investigation will acknowledge that be not only first thought best thought there be polish on gem have heretofore be lacking manuscript will if be not mistaken prove shakespeare to have be more finished writer than have be hitherto imagined there be many new reading once again to refer to speech of kent admired in modern form into purposely cast confident that merit must not escape even in guise out in proper antique dress just be so good a to reperuse perhaps will give voice advantage of trained utterance thus advised mr erin nothing loth repeated line aloud thanks sir butte goe toe thatte unknowne land chaynes pilgrime faste within soyle read sonorously with somewhat pompous air effectively dignity of subject sustained moreover sight of old spelling quaint calligraphy stirred a clang of trumpet move war horse to exhibit best pace be certainly very fine be verdict upon own performance who doe not pronounce that speech replete with pathos energy must resign pretension to poetical taste a emendation on received version persisted william henry have journey sir shortly to go will not admit that compare favourably with consider dear samuel be solemn reply decided improvement spoke in tone of conviction admitted of question sudden a conversion be for in praising what in fact have believed to be son composition have gone to extreme limit that conscience must permit be perfectly genuine there be only very few people in world who form independent judgment on anything upon intrinsic merit most of be slave of authority what be supposed to be authority in matter of opinion in letter men be almost a much victim to name a in art scholar blind to beauty of modern poem can perceive in ancient one even where exist can not be persuaded that schylus be capable of writing dull play antiquary prefers torso of two thousand year old to full length figure by canova may not be good sense be human nature need not ask continued mr erin after pause during gazed at manuscript like cortez on peak at pacific whether precious document came from same treasure house a rest yes sir almost seems a if there be end to have not yet explored curious paper on patron seems to set so little store antiquary eye sparkled under shaggy brow if young man have read very heart must not have replied to secret thought more pertinently hour before have hardly dreamt of existence of such prize now that have be found at once began to suggest most magnificent possibility be first why must be last if manuscript of lear have survived accident of time chance why not that of hamlet alsothe hamlet with ambiguous utterance so differently rendered by shakespearean oracle stood so much in need of authoritative exponent when man for merit of own beyond little bribery at election be made baronet be not so enraptured that beholds in perspective peerage even dream that upon somewhat ampler waistcoat still own may one day repose broad riband of garter what be very remarkable in present manuscript continued william henry be that be free from ribaldry too often disfigures play of shakespeare taste of time be somewhat coarse observed mr erin be almost incredible even to felt that tone be deprecatory be actually making apology for bard of avon to young gentleman of seventeen nevertheless can not believe that shakespeare pandered to observed william henry gravel thing be in opinion introduced by player of period afterwards inserted in stage copy of play from be literally printed thus ear of england have be abused if discovery of manuscript must clear shakespeare memory from ignoble stain will be subject of national congratulation very true assented mr erin felt that remark be insufficient wanting in enthusiasm altogether upon lower level than others argument fact be mind be dwelling upon more personal consideration be reflecting upon own high position a proprietor of unique treasure on what malone must say now reflection while filled with self complacency made set higher value upon william henry than ever for like magician in arabian story must hing without aladdheen to help chapter true lover if mr erin imagined that what malone must say nowie after discovery of lear manuscriptmust need be in way of apology penitence be doomed to disappointment so far from circumstance carrying conviction to soul of commentator making remorseful for past transgression seemed to incite to greater insolence just a so mr erin expressed discovery of new scripture might have incited devil not only against against old one reiterated old objection fortified with new one refused to accept testimony of hemynge note of hand have satisfied friend ally mr wallis repeated horrid suggestion that shakespeare lock be girl ringlet in word raged like heathen having declined to look at lear upon ground of life being too short for examination of such trash pronounced to be plain palpable forgery three word said must suffice for matter published inquiry into certain paper attributed to shakespeare extending to four hundred page quarto whereto mr erin responded at equal length with studious avoidance of personality mr malone have imported into controversy at same time taking liberty to observe in acting various part on stage of life fortune have denied that gentleman quality essential to inasmuch a be critic without taste poet without imagination scholar without learning wit without antiquary without least knowledge of antiquity man of gallantry in dotage be very pretty quarrel a stood far from being confined to two antagonist be taken up by score on side be no longer gentle passage of arm a combat outrance used to be euphoniously called mle only ancient rule of fair fight be utterly disregarded party went at hammer tongs hit one anywhere with anything one must have almost imagined that instead of disagreement among scholar have be theological controversy to statement that one who be not fool knave believed in shakespearean manuscript mr samuel erin scorning to make particular rejoinder replied by simply publishing list of who have appended name to certificate to added footnote stating opinion dr parr have expressed concerning professionnamely that there be many beautiful thing in liturgy of church of england inferior to produced vehement disavowal from hot tempered cleric mentioned that have never stated anything so foolish that word in question have be used by dr warton observation caused coolness between two learned divine to say that william henry football between two opposing party enjoyed must be exaggeration liked being in airand indeed be lauded by many person to very skiesbut did not so much relish being knocked trodden under foot below a popular poet once remarked of reviewer like eulogy well enough dn criticism so young man must have preferred notoriety to have be without alloy on whole pleased vastly margaret be almost angry with for taking men hard word so coolly comforted by reflecting that willie must have heavenly temper a for must say must scratch eye out drive wild to listen to what uncle sometimes read aloud out of horrid pamphlet to young fellow must gallantly reply to have partisan who must not compound for fifty such detractor after good people have right to own opinion though must be confessed express with intemperance have given lear manuscript can not give taste poetic feeling necessary to appreciate of course have wounded margaret be not antagonistic criticism even supercilious contempt accusation have not scrupled to make against william henry good faith one doe not talk of poetic feeling of hostile jury love have a many cause of admiration a burton in anatomy find for melancholy young fellow very carelessness about charge be in margarets eye feather in cap proved for one thing absolute want of foundation if did not understand nicety of point of difference between lear manuscript lear a be printed in uncle quarto edition of play be not for want of instruction there be little else talked of in norfolk street be perhaps one of reason made visit of frank dennis still more rare be clear that whole subject of shakespearean discovery be distasteful to must be confessed that did not even affect interest in good breeding indeed good nature must have seemed to suggest a to comparative merit of old new reading rather a mr erin maintained of accepted original text have opinion to offer one way other be critic must say so that while differing from might give annoyance agreement with must afford satisfactiona remark did not by mean content antiquary when one friend have opinion of own can not surely hurt to adopt opinion be only reasonable that must do so be quite comfort because not wholly looked for to find when pushed home on subject within own judgment mr denniss heart in matter be at least in right place thus when referring one day to onslaught of opponent mr erin instanced a example of microscopic depravity certain objection have be made to hemynges note of hand know of course good fellow how have be proved beyond dispute there be two john hemynges be here when mr albany wallis came other deed be found be young man reply tut tut why of course dear how behindhand be one must really have thought a old friend however little interest take in matter for own sake that must have kept abreast with so far why receipt here have be found since then with memorandum in bard own hand receipt forre moneyes givenne bye talle hemynge onne accounte o curtain theatre did not happen to have heard of said dennis regarding new found treasure if not with indifference certainly with lack of rapture well now see continued mr erin with irritation of course disposes of doubt in direction now forsooth note of hand be objected to upon ground of seal good heaven ejaculated dennis time be evident that be really moved wonder be indignant now remember that drew particular attention to document in question well be almost incredible that accusation have shrunk to puny charge that note of hand even in shakespeare time must not have have seal appended to be not amazing that human nature can stoop to such detraction if have be malonea mere reptilewho make point of globe being theatre instead of playhousebut be lawyer seems child of devil ill warrant like rest of craft considering that william henry now mr erin dear samuel have be articled to conveyancer with idea of becoming lawyer when full grown be somewhat sweeping a well a severe remark carried away by torrent of wrath speaker be wholly unconscious of little inconsistency a if one did not know continuednot to mention fact that in malone own prolegomenon curtain theatre be so called in stackwoods sermon ad that in elizabethan time one not only spelt a liked differently at different time appended seal to document did without a opportunity served be not even probable that hemynge being player knowing little of business may have be particularly solicitous of form of law being observed however superfluous in even so small matter be not in accordance ask with what know of human nature that must be so be clear that be extempore speech even discourse claim of must be satisfied by pen ink one very evidently intended to be printed deliverance gave frank dennis time to recover from certain dismay into mr erin communication have thrown just so said be right doubt objection a to being contrary to custom to append seal seems frivolous enough ground have be cut away from first see in other direction exclaimed antiquary triumphantly margaret continued in high good humour a niece entered room permit to introduce to convert mr frank dennis have be hitherto little better than sceptic light of truth be beginning to dawn upon through cranny have be moved to confess that note of hand at least be genuine have letter to write before post go out so will leave in hand to continue work of conversion door closed behind before frank dennis always slow of speech must form reply gave margaret benefit of never told uncle said in grave pained voice believed note of hand to be genuine illustration what doe matter exclaimed margaret reproachfully can not tell how miserable disagreement distress of indeed be of consequence irritate uncle have still worse effect frank upon can ascribe to other cause indeed that have almost entirely ceased to visit be not quite true moreover be dangerous assertion to make likely to draw upon very reproach have always feared felt be not undeserved trembled lest must reply be not reason be because have preferred william henry love to mine be to relief therefore though also to great surprise that answered in habitual quiet tone perhaps be margaret illustration did not believe be be convinced that in saving so have laid burthen upon conscience for sake nature well knew be so honest simple that shrank from even evasion of truth very fact of having thus evaded to spare showed depth of affection if then still loved be not cruel reflected to ask to home to witness happiness with must miss company for be always pleasant to a of tender faithful friend be not selfish of to invite be obvious that came unwillingly only in obedience to behest if ceased to importune must certainly cease to come must not lose friendship whenthat be ifwillie be married must be different with must then come see a friend of of course very unfortunate stammered with eye fixed on ground since uncle be so thin skinned about manuscript a say be so dreadfully sceptical must perhaps be betteruntil whole affair have subsided looked up for moment in embarrassment of speech met frank face be gazing at with expression of pain pity patience did not understand increased perplexity yes margaret be right said be better away from here for present coming can do good a have surmised give pain at blood rushed to cheek went on in same quiet resolute tone a though have made reference to love for at when one can not say what one will even when nature dictate be clear that one be in false position will not come to norfolk street more be not going awayi mean from home exclaimed girl alarmed by expression in face seemed to forebode worse thing than word implied margaret will be at home where word from will find at service alwaysalways spoke with such tender stress upon word that felt great remorse for what have done to though indeed have be no fault of hers be impossible under present condition of society at least that young woman must make two young men happy at once one of must go to wall perhaps if one have put forward instead of other matter might have be otherwise peach fall to hand be readiest there be men that never win woman love till becomes widow for part in meantimebut be writing of frank dennis be of patient disposition have very moderate opinion of yet love for margaret be great so genuine that must have be content to see happy with man why be not now content be because did not think must be happy did not tell so for though honesty might suggest doing so honour forbade there be honour quite different from of fanfaronnading sort one have nothing to do with running fellow creature through for hasty word with ruining one else to pay card debtsa delicate scrupulous sense of what be becoming even in relation with enemy flower of modest colour grows in shade be sort of honour that frank dennis possessed prompted now to keep silence when might have said something must have be much to own advantage good bye margaret be said a took hand in must if must have even eliminated certain tenderness from tone because knew gave pain must not so utterly conquer nature good bye frank be said in reply dared to say be thinking of not of herself at be pity for made voice

made in wonderful treasure chamber of temple almost day contract mortgage theatrical disbursement miscellaneous letter deed of gift immediately relating to shakespeare if not in very hand be

have be wont to vaguely term have now grown a familiar to a though have have name a well a local habitation well what news from friend to day samuel be cheery question must address to son on return home evening be very seldom that there be news mr erin indeed have cause to be grateful to unknown person since have though not without reluctance given permission for publication of paper have accordingly be advertised to appear in handsome quarto at two guinea included document lear of unfortunately three leaf be missing few page of hamlet last differed little from of accepted text circumstance did not escape notice of enemy who did not hesitate to aver that forger whoever be have found hamlet too difficult nut to crack best reply a mr erin wisely concluded to so coarse sarcasm

of great work of genius in manuscript have not be so indiscreet a to print annalist sarcasm of nisi imperasset applies to author a well a king book evoked storm of censure eye will scarcely permit to read wrote malone posturing a sick lion sneered mr erin have read enough to convince that whole production be forgery others fell foul of style idea very punctuation of discovered manuscript acknowledged that phraseology be simple added that be that sort of simplicity belongs to fool a be time before advocate of discovery must get out rejoinderswith many of who have signed certificate be busymr samuel erin have for present pretty time of be like man caught in downpour of hailstone without umbrella never blenched however for single instant one must have thought that waterproof overall have be invented before time for especial behalf poor margaret trembled shivered how must people be so wicked a to say such thing of willie must not have be so distressed have not seen that shrank from sting womanlike concealed own pain strove to comfort a for imputation upon honour willie be not worth thinking of be a though called negro when one who have ever seen know to be white man still le need trouble about criticism for what can matter to whether manuscript printed copy of shakespeare have greater worth thats true assented young fellow by knitted brow downcast look knew that did matter to nevertheless be have always feared for must publish book of own went on earnestly be so sensitive darling how thankful be shakespeare who can afford to smile at be bearing brunt of not then came rejoinder like sunshine after storm there be not ingenuous character disinterested individual in whole circle of literature wrote one enthusiastic partisan to whom manuscript have be subjected who be not convinced of authenticity have not only convinced scholar antiquary paper maker a to secrecy observed with respect to origin possessor what becomes of acumen of critic if such detail be necessary to establish genuineness of such production occupation be gone a to intrinsic merit of lear seal of shakespeare genius be stamped upon wit so pregnant imagination so unbounded knowledge so intuitive of weakness of human heart a be here exhibited must belong to other man if be not be inspiration here indeed thought william henry be something like criticism be independent opinion with carping of prejudice personal malevolence be not to be mentioned in same breath indeed if eulogy have be product of best mind in most perfect state of equilibrium must scarcely have given more exquisite gratification have sensation about forehead a though wreath of laurel rested there even halo touched star with head if moved upon earth at be on wing be delightful to margaret to see thus hardly recognised in exultant conscious same young fellow whom have known depressed obscure be proud beyond measure of position have made for in world of letter happier still because seemed to make hers to put uncle consent to union beyond question yet a love fashion be still pictured to herself at time delay opposition even obstacle must not be too sure darling said to lovingly one day though thing seem to smile on be promise after bud not flower blossom not fruit true answered thoughtfully be mock engagement battle have yet to come be something however that fighting will be on same field one at least know ground stared at in doubt a to what meant then a if alarmed by wondering look stammered out be thinking of mr erin now know thoroughly rather have become man from what be uncle have changed doubt for better said there be change everywhere for better answered smiling took from pocket one of printed card be now formally issued to purchaser of lately published volume for leave to examine manuscript shakespeare admit albany wallis subscriber to view paper think of mr wallis having bought book malone have quarrelled about seems not about book put in margaret quietly be afraid be not even yet true believer like better for having bought book than even if be felt have behaved badly to when came here with wretched mr talbot purchase of be by way of making amends where differed from mr malone be about john hemynge deed brought from temple mr malone have have malevolence to stigmatise even that a forgery a mr wallis point out since be away from norfolk street only three quarter of hour fraud be impossible out of question be just man with mind open to conviction have have courage to confess in wrong whoever told inquired william henry in amazement person who be friend of like have generous nature methinks do protest too much observed young man drily one be saying anything against informant who be easy to perceive be mr frank dennis thought have literally withdrawn countenance from of late a have done long ago in sense one can control own opinion willie said margaret gently have heard say hundred time concerning very matter that one have right to since very knowledge of frank entertaining certain view though never expressed except upon compulsion be annoyance to uncle thought better to absent still meet elsewhere met in street other day by accident gave be true information have just given to did not volunteer be who spoke to first about mr wallis seems took great care to undeceive a to gentleman having belief in in willie never even spoke of be very true have become subject to for frank sake never alluded in frank presence well of course be not responsible for manuscript do suppose that dennis be thinking of for doe not care one farthing even if be talking of be thinking of when depreciates to depreciates when quote opinion of mr wallis of one else be quoting against need not blush margaret a if mind have just awakened to suspicion of truth do suppose dont know what mr frank dennis have be after along will not pretend to be ignorant of what mean willie said margaret firmly be quite mistaken if imagine that frank dennis have ever breathed word to a believe to one to disadvantage have loyal heart be true friend friend indeed said william henry scornfully yes indeed in need will lay life on willie man who detests falsehood deceit even if entertained unworthy thought of rival must hold peace about be why doubt did not speak of put in young man bitterly detraction can be conveyed by silence a well a by forked tongue be unjust unkind willie still fact remains that whenever see gentleman risei will not say by comparison because believe love mebut rise in opinion can not deny face confesses under circumstance can hardly think unreasonable if ask for present not to meet mr frank dennis even by accident in street will not speak to willie if object to said margaret in low voice be more distressed at what have said because have secret consciousness that be not undeserved did not indeed sink in opinion after talk with frank certainly did not suffer by contrast on other hand did not rise while confidence in genuineness of shakespearean document did sink thence arose misgiving a to future doubt whether willie must be permitted to win certain unsteadiness not indeed of purpose of outlook of course must speak to if meet maggie continued william henry in tone from irritation have disappeared only for present seek society will not long have to deny pleasure since in few be intend very shortly to ask mr erin to give to for very own oh willie will never do returned not however with much conviction a one who toy with doubt be sure doe not dream of having such intention then must be a blind a gloster maggie allusion to lear be somehowit must have be difficult to say whyunwelcome to love doubt depends upon very small comparatively mundane matter still that hope of marriage with lover must hang upon general belief in genuineness of old manuscript seemed little humiliating must have far preferred have be possible that william henry must have won way to modest competence by own pen perhaps have hope of surprise in store for why must have used phrase in few week be true that have substituted for more vague expression must not help thinking that have definite plan in mind to precipitate event what must be chapter xxii bargain book go bravely samuel observed mr erin a father son be sitting together one evening with margaret between william henry hand be resting on back of chair at time addressed in tone so low that word must need have have more meaning for third person than if have be in foreign tongue yet contiguity confidence remained unreproved perhaps among other recently developed virtue in young man be put down by mr erin who have quick eye for main chance to william henry credit that never questioned father right to treat shakespearean paper a own to demand account of stewardship with respect to antiquary however have scruple of own if did not compel to part with hard money induced to look upon milch cow with very lenient indulgent eye be surely only natural that two young people must entertain very strong mutual attachment through long familiarity doubtless seemed more like brother sister to one than cousin must not be said in short that mr erin winked at love making shut eye to must have be very inconvenient to have said to certain question quite impossible to say yes be better that thing must take own course even if be little dangerous than to make matter uncomfortable by interference from first to last lad continued in cheerful voice will make little short of l expect indeed said william henry indifferently to do justice cared little for money at time just now le than usual appetite even for fame have for present lost keenness love possessed wholly cared only for margaret to think that new reading of old playthough to be sure be shakespeare playshould produce so much went on mr erin complacently good heaven what must not public give for new play by immortal bard question be observed william henry what must give mr erin remark be so unexpected delivered in such quiet tone for moment antiquary be dumbfounded between disbelief expectancy made reply dear samuel murmured presently be possible can be serious that have in possession nay sir interrupted young man smiling never said that posse within last few day have known of existence of such manuscript have known not told exclaimed antiquary reproachfully why might have died in meantime then must have seen shakespeare must have told about returned william henry lightly answer father like said margaret in low reproving tone be plain indeed that mr erin be greatly agitated eye be fixed upon son without speculation in looked like one in trance to whom have be vouchsafed wondrous vision know what be best returned young man under breath pressing margarets shoulder with hand arm still hung over chair manner be studiously unmoved a becomes master of situation where be gasped old man in temple have not yet obtained permission to bring away until must do felt be useless to speak about matterthat must only be discredited even unless saw manuscript might hesitate to believe in authenticity manuscript exclaimed mr erin mind too monopolised by splendour of discovery to descend to detail have really seen then with own eye unacted play of shakespeare unpublished one at event have certainly seen within two hour only in patron presence said that found be to be yours exclaimed mr erin petulantly well up to time have be a good a word said william henry smiling indeed have remarked margaret must not be ungrateful uncle nevertheless people must perform what promise observed antiquary severely for second time margaret felt gentle pressure upon shoulder seemed a though willie have whispered hear that play be called vortigern rowena continued young man admirable subject murmured antiquary ecstatically be of course historical there be hengist horsus horsa suggested mr erin shakespeare writes horsus horsa be perhaps sister perhaps admitted antiquary with prompt adhesion treatment how doe rank a regard other production nay sir be for to judge be critic tell that patron will not part with have not yet persuaded to do so by mean despair of in meantime have copy of dear samuel at first tried to commit to memory found task beyond power be very long play longer better murmured antiquary not when one have to get by heart observed william henry drily tone manner be more in contrast to of elder man than ever a one grew heated other seemed to grow cooler cooler there be question a to of just at present be likely to prove better hand at bargain why do talk thus samuel play play thing since have why do not produce can not imagine that delayindeed anythingcan enhance interest feel in most marvellous of discovery william henry face grew very grave be true that be mine be yours in sense said still must pardon for remarking that be discovery margaret started in chair if have not felt william henry grasp upon wristfor have shifted position be confronting antiquary face to faceshe must have risen from have never given cousin credit for such self assertion trembled for result did not even yet suspect have motive in be concerned situation alarmed be like of audacious clerk who demand of master partnership with certain difference that made even graver what be want inquired antiquary too have become conscious that relation between william henry be about to enter on new phase nevertheless tone be conciliatory like of man who though somewhat tried can not afford to quarrel with bread butter be last man hope to be illiberal continued if be dealing with stranger must frankly own what have rather hope to have to dispose of be valuable commodity to indeed a know be more valuable than to mere dealer in such ware nevertheless hope will be reasonable after be question of what thing will fetch suppose will not ask fancy price william henry smiled well people might think so mr erin be not money at require of not money echoed antiquary in voice of great relief well that indeed show proper spirit be really pleased to find that be to have haggling over matter of kind in truth must be little short of sacrilege if have fixed mind upon of poor possession though must even be decameron earliest edition extant complete except for title page be not decameron sir quarto of with marginal note in own hand be small matter indeed by comparison with magnificent discovery hardly know what have must in way appear to equivalent be assured that anything at disposal be very much at service then if please sir will take margaret margaret mr erin repeated name in tone of such supreme amazement a must not have be exceeded have young man stipulated for wig perhaps surprise be little simulated be certainly not case with margaret sat in silence covered with blush with eye fixed on table before very much frightened by mean hurt while trembled at willies audacity admired illustration then if please sir will take margaret mr erin shot glance at convinced that must get help from quarter if have not be cognisant of young fellow intention be clear that proposal have made be not displeasing to antiquary ransacked mind for objection must meet case there be plenty of there none of fit for use at same time strong enough very powerful one at once occurred to in question what do propose to live upon unhappily answer be equally obvious upon most intolerable suggestion one whichon brink of bargainit be not convenient to combat for moment too objection of consanguinity occurred to that be cousin admirable plea because be quite insurmountable though might have have weight with margaret doubted of efficacy in william henry case inasmuch a probably knew that be not cousin to have question raised in young lady presenceor indeed at allwas not to be thought of in end have to content with commonplace argument of immaturity unsatisfactory at best since only delay evil day margaret surely can not be serious dear lad why united age scarcely make up that of marriageable man be really too ridiculous be not eighteen rejoinder that be objection time must be relied on to remove be obvious william henry did not make be not only playing for great stake be necessary that must be paid in ready money venture to think mr erin said respectfully that case be somewhat exceptional have known one for long time very intimately be not question of calf love moreover to be frank with value in eye be now at highest may learn to esteem more trust may a time go on can not hope commercially to be at premium now never therefore be time to sell though spoke of a article of barter be well aware that mr erin thought be fixed upon purchase a be included in same lot dear samuel be so altogether unexpected so be discovery of manuscript put in young fellow with pitiless logic be like springing mine on lad vortigern rowena be also mine hope will prove so be quick rejoinder might be urged against william henry erin must not be said that have not wit about have only copy objected antiquary though felt argument to be inadequate since be liable to be swept away nay returned young man smiling what becomes of acumen of critic if internal evidence be insufficient to establish authenticity occupation be gone be mr erin favourite quotation from rejoinder to use against be like seething kid in mother milk roused for first time to vigorous opposition be possible that also saw opportunity for spurring other on to gain possession of precious document be mighty fine young sir be not question of sentiment must see play in shakespeare own handwriting before can take most unlooked for proposal into consideration at at present whole affair be in air will see play said william henry composedly moreover continued antiquary with equal firmness will not be sufficient that must be convinced of authenticity must receive general acceptance can hardly promise sir that there will be objector returned young man drily mr malone for example will probably have something to say mention of devil a antiquary in moment of irritation be wont to call respectable commentator be most successful speak of rational being sir returned mr erin with quite what be called in painting early manner what malone may take into head to think be absolutely indifferent to speak of public voice a heard for instance at national theatre suggested william henry earnestly suppose that vortigern rowena must be acted at drury lane covent garden be received a bona fide production of shakespeare must test content that ordeal must be of sufficiently crucial nature be indubitable yet not more so than confidence with be proposed if least glimmer of doubt a to genuineness of shakespearean ms still reigned in antiquary mind voice manner of son a spoke word must have dispelled immaturity of two young people be not much altered for better since mr erin have cited a bar to union under circumstance now suggested position must be very materially improved play at drury lane in day meant money in pocket successful play be small fortune might even be large one must have greatly preferred to have precious m like others for nothing after what be demanded of be better than being asked to give hard cash for pig in poke be only promise to pay upon condition must make payment comparatively easy if vortigern rowena be successful continued william henry with quiet persistence of carpenter who strike same nail on head must be understood have permission to marry a soon a plea poor mr erin looked appealingly at niece will surely not be so indelicate glance seemed to say a to wish to precipitate matter of kind looked in vain did not be true say will though there be even blush on cheek might have seemed to flatter expectation kept silence in case be impossible to construe otherwise than a consent old gentleman must have hereupon felt justified in saying that young woman be not so forward in time that such conduct be in experience unprecedented reflection to judge by frequency with be indulged in under similar circumstance must seem to give sort of consolation antecedent of mr samuel erin be unhappily a have hinted not of sufficiently ascetic nature to enable to use solace perhaps must like to read play suggested william henry very much replied antiquary with eagerness just a please mr erin be yours of course upon understanding supposing to realise expectation that have consent to marriage very good replied antiquary without eagerness at in tone have substitution be feasible must have better suited with very bad chapter xxiii unexpected ally illustration have gone before a regarded shakespeare ms sank into almost insignificance a compared with stir made by vortigern rowena superiority of new lamp over old one have with well known exception in arabian night be pretty generally acknowledged in clime time if scrap of writing from great genius who have left nothing of behind save a have be hitherto supposed couple of signature have have attraction if original draft of well known play two have set town by ear one may imagine excitement produced by discovery of brand new drama in master hand mr samuel erin door in norfolk street be positively besieged by applicant to view wonder gentleman however declined for present to gratify public curiosity conscious a be of importance of own position be also fully aware of necessity of strengthening against comer among whom must necessarily be many foe william henry have be a good a word have though with great difficulty persuaded patron to part with precious manuscript have be duly placed in antiquary hand by external internal evidence be fully satisfied with authenticity be necessary that world without must share conviction mahomet seems be for considerable time content with single believer when consider that believer be wife be discreditable to claim if must only have converted valet de chambre also ought to have be well satisfied mr erin a be aware be in much better position a to follower then wanted so much more mahomet so far a know have not just then two guinea edition of koran in hand sale of be beginning to slacken be doubtful whether immediate publication of vortigern might not injure predecessor unless genuineness must be better authenticated to end mr erin took bold step of convening committee of commentator critic to report upon m selection be made from who have signed certificate who be therefore favourable others be invited who have not so compromised even who might be supposed to be hostile including mr albany wallis one must say that be hole corner business far le that assembly be packed must without doubt have be much more agreeable to mr erin if have be for have to listen to very unpleasant thing for most part be true be said by small men just a in great railway meeting of present day shareholder who have just put enough in undertaking to qualify to speak at be always most loquacious so second rate critic who have not much chance of being listened to in world without be if not most sceptical most vituperative poor mr erin be not chairman who must ignore style matter calligraphy of vortigern nay even very paper on be written underwent sharpest scrutiny evoked very bitter remark dr parr dr warton two great card of certificate be strongly in favour of play carried many with including laureate pye brother poet sir james burgess there be also many adversary fact be notwithstanding that famous dictum about occupation of critic being gone if intrinsic merit of work be not sufficient to establish genuineness though excellence of vortigern be on whole admitted story of how came into william henry hand be real obstacle to acceptance patron of temple be too much wrapped in mystery to be satisfactory to mind of most committee be to sit for two day then decide by vote upon important question be there be there not sufficient evidence before of authenticity of play william henry be always present witness whose examination be always proceeding a be in circle keenest expert must get nothing out of beyond what have be already got have nothing to tell save what have already told manner be cool collected produced favourable impression sir james burgess said if young man be not speaking truth be marvellous actor be informed upon authority in case can certainly not be disputed that be seventeen authority be not quite so good a sir james imagined fact be a stated alone with mr erin margaret young fellow be even more self reliant be hopeful decision committee might arrive at there be still must say appeal to public in expressed confidence in mr erin must not agree if play be discredited by who have be so solemnly convened to judge of doubted of acceptance out of door on second important day there be even fuller attendance than on first among new comer be bishop of st andrew good natured divine enough who produced unfavourable impression by quoting porsons iambic three child sliding on ice great professor pretended to have found in old trunk among manuscript play of sophoclesan obvious satire upon shakespearean discovery greek wit be never so mirth provoking a to endanger life at specimen be difficult for mr samuel erin to force smile what even more depressed be unexpected arrival of mr reginald talbot how young man have gained admittance must not understand at time real ground of objection to must not of course be stated public opinion have be challenged on brink of decision must have be madness indeed to have altercation with one who have evinced scepticism talbot have come in alone taken seat rather apart from rest face looked le florid than usual resolute enough after one glance round room fixed eye upon ground moment antiquary expected to hear blatant voice giving utterance to offensive imputation remained silent listening to pro con of senior with particular interest a seemed in matter william henry have seen enter of coursethere be few thing escaped observationbut have shown sign of concern far le of apprehension either did not fear have screwed courage to sticking place now then indeed glanced nervously at door from fear of enemy have misgiving lest margarets anxiety upon account might compel to come hear for how matter be going on very groundless apprehension for nothing must have be more foreign to retiring modest nature than to have intruded upon assembly after who wished to speak have have say laureate rose addressed meeting have listened very attentively said to opinion have be advanced on side upon subject of controversy if must not say that have come to definite conclusion thought that have at least gathered general view of present play before be undoubtedly remarkable one must not take upon to say from internal evidence whether be be not written by william shakespeare on whole believed to have be so person better qualified than to judge of such matter have expressed for against other proof of authenticity again on whole seemed to to be in favour what after be great stumbling block be mysteryand a seemed to unnecessary mysterythat hung about discovery here there be audible expression of assent mr erin pale trembling much more with anger than with fear be about to rise laureate waved back be not going to have peroration spoilt by man there be general murmur of pye pye under other circumstance must have sounded exquisitely humorous be like bread riot of upper class under circumstance continued orator if anyone can be found who have seen m a be in situ have met unknown patron of temple in flesh so a to corroborate so far testimony of young gentleman here pointed to william henry for one will have hesitation in acknowledging believer in absence of such witness must take leave at least to reserve judgment there be long significant silence if speaker have not expressed view of majority have done so for many of present while want of corroborative testimony such a have indicated be felt by even mr erin perhaps for first time understood how evidence have be be perfectly conclusive to might well fail thus unsupported to satisfy public mind felt like young blood who have recently be endeavouring for bet to dispose within five minute of hundred sovereign to a many person on london bridge for penny apiece ms be genuine if must not persuade people to believe where must be profit well continued laureate in self satisfied tone for be pleased with impression eloquence have produced especially that have reduced antiquaryin whose mind have created desert called peaceto silence well question be be there such witness a have described yes there be word fell upon general ear like bombshell one be more utterly astounded by than mr samuel erin must hardly believe ear when looked to quarter from proceededand to one else be lookinghe must not believe eye for man have uttered be mr reginald talbot young man be not indeed in appearance quite sort of witness whom one must have chosen to establish authenticity of ancient literary document though at police court in case of assault provided victim be respectable have be for prosecution might have be passable enough dress be that of young man of fashion not of good fashion manner be suggestive le of confidence than of swagger face spoke of indulgence in liquor on other hand impression may have be partly caused by contrast with learned pundit most of in wig of in shovel hat scarcely seemed to belong to same race very eye glass headed cane carried so jauntily in hand be out of keeping with eye glass looked like gay young lens who have refused to be put into spectacle be winking at life on own hook doe one know young gentleman inquired mr pye with significant hesitation yes know observed mr albany have be true slight acquaintance with personal character come of respectable parentage may add that have two hundred year of own good money observed mr talbot with complacency strong irish accent mr pye looked at very dubiously in spite of assurance of financial solvency addressed to previous speaker in case before mr wallisand need not say how opinion will weigh with usdo consider gentleman a dependable witness mr reginald talbot turned very red not having retort on hand suitable to bestow on poet laureate very wisely held tongue be bound to say said mr wallis gravely that mr talbot have given attention to authenticity of shakespeare ms up to time have expressed with somewhat unnecessary vehemence to discredit evidence may therefore have to offer in favour will have weight with then company awaited in expectant silence for mr reginald talbot narrative what mr wallis have said be quite right said that young gentleman with unnecessary affability did use to think that there be something amiss with shakespeare paper have idea mr william henry erin yonder be playing trick so made business to watch hung about chamber in new innthey be on ground floor though pretty high upand with short ladder have made shift to see what be going on when be alone in room little suspected william henry standing apart with folded arm listened to confession of former friend with contemptuous smile if be revelation to displayed indifference of north american indian for day day watched discovered nothing then dogged step to city where went afternoon on two occasion turned a if to see whether be followed think saw william shook head well at event thought did gave up third time walking on other side of street very careful to leave safe distance between tracked to staircase in temple stopped at door on first floor entered without knocking waited bit then followed old gentleman be seated in room alone in armchair reading looked up from book in great astonishment inquired very curtly who be said that came upon business of importance after young mr erin rose opening inner door exclaimed here be friend of yours sir what be meaning of intrusion here spoke very angrily felt that have reason for when erin came out said talbot have ruined felt sorry for what have done there be nothing for to make clean breast of with many apology of not slightest notice be taken explained that curiosity suspicion that world be being gulled by pretended discovery have induced to look into matter be spy then cried old gentleman thought for moment that be going to throw out of window rage instantly subsided take into next room erin show said took accordingly there saw immense quantity of old manuscript strewed about floor must say whole cartfuls of be so sorry so ashamed of never spoke word till erin let out again be sorry came said be quite satisfied sir erin spoke truth dont care farthing sir whether be satisfied not replied old gentleman have taken mean advantage of friend unpardonable liberty with then told upon honour a hoped to be saved must never reveal name to human being waved hand contemptuously observed that word oath together be not worth sixpence if have feeling for friend remorse for baseness have committed have better hold tongue since if by mean secret must be discovered erin must never darken door again receive from of benefit have be intention to confer upon erin did not speak to at have never spoken to from day to hearing by accident of meeting resolved to come here do must for by way of reparation be have got to say narrative made immense impression mr samuel erin sighed great sigh of relief looked around with triumphant exultation have not needed confirmation of son story for felt how opportune with respect to others be young man testimonythat in in fact have entertained angel very much unawares murmur of satisfaction ran round company face of even most sceptical relaxed severity william henry alone looked totally unmoved like one who have along be conscious that character must be cleared one way be indifferent in what way question be put to talbot nothing be elicited to shake evidence indeed since have by own showing taken oath that must not reveal name of templar unknown there be little more to be extracted from laureate in short dignified speech observed that after very testimony have stated be only thing wanting to conviction have be forthcoming must not in reason offer further objection to authenticity of play that for part admitted to whole company with hardly dissentient voice expressed agreement committee dispersed after passing unanimous resolution that vortigern rowena be genuine play of william shakespeare chapter xxiv manager last two day have be very trying one for little household in norfolk street though success have crowned hope bore mark of struggle that evening even young william henry who like antiquarian duchess with difference seemed to have be born before nerve have come into fashion showed sign of terrible ordeal through have passed be tender footed after red hot ploughshare antiquary be almost in state of collapse while margaret a sensible contained girl a be to be found on side of thames between gratitude to heaven love to man became for first time in life hysterical be well for willie at last doubted with reason whether exposed to brunt of battle fighting for what be dearer to than life honour have suffered a much a have done sitting in little room apart from mle picturing to herself terror of defeat listened to narrative of proceeding with fearful joy deemed at first mr pye basest presently best of men felt secret gratitude to mr albany wallis that must have found difficult to explain have impression that be not ally that strong sense of justice mingled perhaps with remorse for part have on former occasion taken against have made something more than neutral remorse too felt a regarded person to whom final triumph be after mainly owing where be mr talbot willie said excitedly must like to tell not only how much indebted be to how wrong be judgment have previously formed of to be sure observed antiquary navely where be talbot when city have be preserved a scripture say nobody remembers name of obscure individual who saved in glow of victory mr erin have clean forgotten young irish ally suppose modesty prevented from waiting to receive acknowledgment doubt be modesty said william henry drily a for gratitude maggie think be somewhat misplaced if have now done good once did best to do harm thus far be only quits be dirty trick following samuel to temple observed mr erin though a happened have turned out to advantage still be not one who be ready to make reparation for error said margaret gravely to there be reply from uncle margaret hardly expected be man who took gift heaven vouchsafed without excess of fervour from willie have looked for more generosity of spirit on other hand might be little jealous have vague impression that young irish gentleman have made clumsy attempt in confederation with eye glass to recommend to attention in case of course willie be forgiven at event continued smiling for idea amused will not be considered forward if thank mr talbot on own account when next pay visit will not have least objection returned william henry in same light tonethough taking upon to say so be significant enough of confidence in positionbut be afraid will not have early opportunity of relieving mind of weight of gratitude talbot go home to morrow by irish packet then saw after before left afternoon cried margaret why understood that have fled to avoid thanks be father view said william henry touching one have not heart to combat a matter of fact did see talbot for one moment of course thanked oh willie willie why will always make out worse than be exclaimed margaret reproachfully think have better say nothing about observed antiquary thoughtfully margaret looked up rather sharply at thought word have reference to william henry modest concealment of own virtue that be disputing fact strange to say though estimable young man be before eye mr erin be not thinking of at will leave others to say what like continued fight out among in twenty four hour whole town will be talking of nothing else mean about play sir suggested william henry well of course what devil else must mean returned antiquary with irritation be disgusting that two young peoplefor niece looked a much at sea a sonshould be so wrapped up in one commonplace affair a to have forgotten vortigern rowena already think will be better to rest on oar wait event shut eye open mouth said william henry see what heaven will send remark be flippant sense of be in accordance with mr erin view in exaltation of spirit even condescended to reply in same vein will open mouth pretty wide can tell when manager come must not go to of course know best said william henry modestly if left to impetuosity of youth must have led on morrow cap m in hand to stage door of nearest theatre fortunately see can afford to wait said mr erin composedly william henry glanced at margaret margaret dropped eye mr erin sentiment though intended to be comforting even exultant be strange to say not shared by young people have not however to wait long a mr erin have predicted news that committee appointed to investigate claim of vortigern m have decided in favour flew swiftly over town from palace to cottage said mr erin in enthusiasm though probably only reached cottage orn letter of congratulation poured in from quarter even malone be reported to have said that if must have be done incognito must have liked to see manuscript what really said be wish that steevens have found meaning that must have taken real pleasure in eviscerating opinion of antiquary be divided if reid ritson denounced play garter king at arm be enthusiastic in favour gave more supporter than heraldry ever dreamt of before week be over came mr harris proprietor of covent garden theatre to norfolk street in person announcement of name set william henry heart beating more quickly than have done even on fateful afternoon in anne hathaway garden for first time shrank from customary ordeal of investigation mr erin interviewed manager alone a happened young man need have be under apprehension of brow beating mr harris be practical man of expansive mind did not stoop to detail committee hear sir have decided in favour of play of yours be first remark be delivered with quite unnecessary abruptness be not tone alone grated upon mr erin ear play of mine a have thought proper to term mr harris replied with dignity be shakespeare play so say indeed so many other people say must not be here be cool rejoinder between ourselves mr erin speaking a one man of world to dont care farthingcertainly not queen anne farthingwhether be shakespeare play not question that concern be do public believe to be such be to understand then that wish to examine m examine certainly not time be very much occupiedit be in five act be not be in five act assented antiquary must hardly trust to reply except in others word mr harris indifference notwithstanding that promised to facilitate matter be most offensive to mr pye have be so good a to promise prologue for play thats good prologue by poet laureate will look well in bill must have epilogue ready even thoughhere smiled grimlywe never get so far a that suggestion of such contingencywhich of course meant total failurein cold blood filled up cup of antiquary indignation almost resolved whatever man offered to decline proposition to bring out play mr merry will write epilogue replied icily very good manfor epilogue replied manager drily well must strike while iron hot not at must not give public time to flag in enthusiasm what will be worse perhaps to alter opinion there be risk of even now be ready to run ill take play devil will said mr erin yes will continued manager calmly taking pretending to take explosion of companion a expression of admiration of own courage will cost good bit of money ill take never charge farthing for placing on board offer be not likely to get again promise ill take word for said antiquary quietly have passed glowing stage of indignation into white heat look almost like coolness dont think other human being must venture to make so audacious proposal have really impudence to ask to give play of shakespeare for nothing for nothing what do call advertisement nothing how be author name established how doe acquire fame fortune through opportunity of becoming known how must get better one than having play acted at covent garden be not aware that shakespeare stood in need of advertisement mr harris returned antiquary grimly even supposing that thanks to becomes popular be not rising young author must vortigern rowena be ever so successful must not enable to find of play must be great encouragement to do answered manager impudently however there offer there door mr harris mr erin pointed to with unmistakable significance stuff nonsense said manager what do want how do suppose play be brought out man come what do say to profit then look herenow be last chance a im christian man then will have said mr erin be first approach to epigram have ever made in life anger be short madness genius be kind of madness so perhaps came about fury suggested to that lively sally hundred pound down half profit be last word cried manager thundered antiquary be still upon leg with outstretched arm pointing to door like finger post manager walked into passage opened front door held in hand hundred fifty half profit very good more than hundred fifty pound for play of shakespeare who spell with final e will not give door closed behind with great bang sounded however le like thunder clap to mr erin than concluding sarcasm be not aware that pamphlet have be published that very morning pointed out that spelling of with e practice pursued throughout vortigern have be utterly unknown not only to elizabethan time to other when mr erin rejoined two young people who be waiting for with little anxiety in next room there be need to ask news face told nevertheless margaret said well uncle before must stop be not well answered passionately be devilish bad surely mr harris be not uncivil uncivil who want civility who fool must expect in theatrical manager bring playthe vortigern what be matter now inquired william henry manner a usual be imperturbable mr erinso great be revolution wrought in by recent circumstancesseemed at once to derive comfort from well very unfortunate seems that objection have be discoveredinsignificant in itselfbut seriously affect genuineness indeed there have be good many not insignificant objectionsand yet have be generally accepted said young man smiling nothing to smile at do assure if what that fellow said be correct have manuscript before be examining with nervous eagerness through glass yes here one here with e why must shakespeare spell with e looked up sharply at son a if asking riddle of one who have answer to be sure dont know sir replied william henry quietly spelt thing pretty much a pleased thats true thats true just now certainly most disappointing that there must be hitch very star in course seem to fight against be unfortunate conjunction be said young man smiling again objection of mr harris speaks may be new not spelling be so spelt in profession of faith for example indeed have escaped recollection come be satisfactory then who signed certificate will be with be foolish of to be so discouraged did mr harris decline play on ground of being written with final e well no didnt decline only used that argument perhaps in order to get at cheap rate suggested william henry a know have not be case have pretty broadly hinted that did not believe to be shakespeare play at even that there might be plenty more where vortigern came from so bound up in wondrous discovery have mr erin mind become that be distressing humiliating to have to confess a much even to son niece why yes wanted cheap therefore of course depreciated only offered one hundred fifty pound for half profit william henry looked up amazed for first time self control deserted in heart thought antiquary fool for having refused such term be not rejection of term annoyed so much a rejection of chance of having play produced at theatre like covent garden feeling in fact be precisely same a on mr harris have countedwithout host money in hand may be small sir half profitsin case play be successfulas feel must have be might have be well worth having mr erin began to think so too by time after what did matter whether manager be believer in play not have theatre be only made channel of introduction to public sat in moody silence thinking whether must be possible after what have passed to win tassel gentle mr harris back again be certain that mr erin must have to swallow very large leek first servant girl entered bringing slip of paper upon salver name doubt of one of thousand one person who be now always coming to ask permission to see m two gentleman to see sir said maid antiquary glanced at name then a high a gentleman of sixty can leap from chair margaret thinking uncle have be seized with maladypresumably jumpsuttered little scream of terror good heaven what be sheridan cried triumphantly there be more fish in sea samuel than have come out of better one see lad in own handwriting be here in personrichard brinsley sheridan favoured by dr parr chapter xxv two distinguished visitor richard brinsley sheridan pride of palace bower hall orator dramatist minstrel who ran through mode of lyre be master of be very great man in day in many way what made just now of especial importance to mr samuel erin be that be manager of drury lane theatre mr harris of covent garden must have snapped at vortigern bait have be satisfactory circumstance enough though indeed have only sucked got off hook coming of sheridan be quite matter compared with other manager be small fry be with le assured demeanour therefore than usual with expectancy somewhat tempered with awe mr samuel erin repaired to parlour even m in hand have lost of virtue in view of authority who be about to pronounce upon be almost a if have be young author with own play work of immense original genius be about to submit for first time to leading publisher be relief to to feel that dr parr must be present who be well known to believer in shakespearean manuscript a entered room great man came forward to shake frankly by hand manner be more than gracious be genial seemed to put at ease in moment appearance be not imposinga man of forty five inclined to corpulency with loose fitting coat secured by one button over chest carelessly knotted white neck clothhe wore own hair already very grey tied behind with black riband face be puffy evinced sign of what be even then called free living what redeemed however invested whole man with marvellous attraction be bright sparkling eye glittered with merriment good humour antiquary be so fascinated with for moment took notice of other person in room till sheridan called attention to illustration other instead of taking hand drew up have doubtless seen friend here pretty often before mr said smiling antiquary turned round held out hand mechanically other however instead of taking drew up to full height be good way put hand behind bowed stiffly be not dr parr john kemble mr erin a playgoer have of course seen pretty often before generally in royal robe in armour attired a king warrior a happened have never before seen in plain clothes have noble figure handsome facethough strange to say not very mobile oneand so far be in strong contrast to companion difference in expression be even greater mr kemble have sternness of demeanour be almost forbidding reminded mr erin on instant that be intimate friend of malone did not expect honour of visit from mr kemble said antiquary drily did not come sir of own free will be uncompromising reply delivered in deep tragic tone be here at request of friend mr sheridan quite true observed that gentleman eye dancing with laughter at antagonistic attitude of two companion tragedian like stately st bernard with stiff tail who resents attention of half breed of insignificant stature venture to entertain very tolerable opinion of dragged here mr erin like iniquity with cart rope quarrel of commentator know be like bar of castle theyll be shot rather than open arm to one for sake however hope will of make truce while little matter of business be under discussion then to again hammer tongs with heartnow wheres play mr erin produced from breast pocket into have hurriedly thrust oh thats be gad carry about with a mother carry newborn babe whose paternity have never be questioned kemble smiled a coriolanus might have done at mention of gratitude think mr sheridan said antiquary in offended tone if will be so good a to glance at yonder certificate including among other authority friend dr parr must admit that legitimacy of vortigern rowena be tolerably well established herbert croft dr walton poet laureate sir james bland burgess be voucher weighty enough indeed interposed manager impatiently anything ought to go down with such name attached to play play thing let look at be detail if report spoke true that sheridan did not always insist upon have offered to accept comedy from authoress of evelina unread to put on board of drury lane even now when manuscript be spread out before seemed to shrink from task have imposed upon gad exclaimed there seems good lot of there be two thousand eight hundred line in explained mr erin gravely fourteen hundred line be deemed sufficient for acting drama observed mr kemble acidly drama of william shakespeare sir with happen to have acquaintance returned antiquary with bitter significance extend in more than one case to greater length than vortigern come come kemble said manager good naturedly surplusage be error one can hardly complain because one get two play for price of one now mr erin must prefer to be present at investigation not mother generally shrink from inquest upon even foster child there have be roman matron make invariable rule mr sheridan put in antiquary hastily though on present occasion there be ground of course for being put in practice never to permit literary offspring of speak to leave hand afraid of body snatching eh think of wanting to steal play kemble why drury lane be perfect foundling hospital for however just a please sir then while mr erin sat apart affecting to be immersed in folio with ear wide open two sat down to manuscript from kemble now then read aloud in deep sonorous tone be not always so sarcastic a intended to be there be certain rhythmical roll in many line like thunder of surf also a in case head of foam gave impression of strength for example full fifty breathless body struck sight with gaping mouth did seem to mock whilst others smiling in cold death scoffingly bade look on soon must wrench from off brow sacred crown make too subject like from kembles mouth at least such line be not wanting in majestic vigour though lent to involuntarily be evident enough indeed that be adverse to acceptance of play while sheridan be in favour of doubtless furthered mr erin hope be that sheridan have notoriously very high opinion of shakespeare thought genius exaggerated presently kemble came to three best line in tragedy give sword have so clogged badged with blood slippery gore that doth mock grasp sword say speech delivered with fine emphasis come be better than titus andronicus anyway said sheridan slily echo sir mere echo of richard third growled tragedian let hope will answer with richard fourth be laughing rejoinder disagreement be like conflict between whale sword fish must have same end dont mean to say that thing here be not better than others said kemble doggedly though perhaps may be permitted to add that hear to best advantage to whole thing have false ring perhaps want of ear returned manager do think mr kemble here sank voice to whisper that many people have good ear drollery even roguishness of face a hazarded inquiry be indescribable tragedian put question by pursued argument think of shakespeare mr sheridan must allow that at least always wrote poetry now much of what have have honour to read to be not poetry let suppose shakespeare be drunk sir exclaimed tragedian in offended tone sir echoed antiquary dropping folio with crash good heaven gentleman may not one even put postulate even euclid writer of little imagination permit that much be not such very impossible supposition have never heard of man of genius with turn for bottle a looked very hard at tragedian that gentleman felt called upon to reply have personal experience of anything of kind said loftily well of course not how must returned sheridan blandly with curve of lip seemed to say be talking of men of genius perhaps reference to own weakness made bitter if be so feeling be very transitory be with most winning smile that presently addressed friend come prester john can hing without in affair surely will not fail will have responsibility in matter be haughty reply will not append name to yonder list will not have go forth to world admit genuineness of production will not stamp with warranty will not tut tut man broke in manager impatiently youll act youll act well yes will play vortigern mr siddons will play edmunda nay sir be question for herself can not answer for sarah always take own way to hear talk one must think be wife instead of sister said manager laughing then country girl so mr jordan be called from first success have be made in piece will be flavia who have to appear in man clothes love to wear breech a poor duke have long discovered well well take friend shakespeare play mr erin manager rose from chair with yawn like one who have concluded distasteful business ahem nothing have be said about term suggested antiquary term doe mean money said manager looking towards tragedian with air of extreme astonishment a though must say can believe ear be almost inclined to believe doe replied other smiling for first time surely not money down not ready money cant mean that antiquary face unmistakably implied that did good heaven mr erin who have ready money be just talking of duke of clarence have ready money not guineathough must threaten to drown like namesake in butt of malmseyto save life money might be paid out of profit of first night then half profit suggested mr erin mere detailsbusiness cried manager disdainfully must see albany wallis about thats pretty face added stopping abruptly beneath picture on wall pointing to ita charming face be portrait of niece margaret aye aye love faith pure soul in fair body true heart be sure of voice freighted with genuine feeling seemed to melt away in music be in truth good girl mr sheridan light of poor house take care of sir be kind to lest when be too late rue be gone in flash door closed behind mr erin looked at tragedian in amazement likeness to late wife fancy observed that gentleman in grave explanation death be matter of much regret to seemed to be about to hold out hand something restrained eye have lit by chance on certificate good morning mr erin said with stiff bow good morning mr kemble chapter xxvi two actress arrangement made between mr samuel erin on behalf of son william henry infant with mr albany wallis for production of play be eminently satisfactory mr erin be to receive three hundred pound on morning after first night of representation half profit for next sixty night shakespeare have probably never made so good bargain news of acceptance of vortigern by management of drury lane theatre immensely increased public excitement concerning in day old drury though indeed be then far from old be national theatre fact of play being played upon board independently of sheridan having chosen gave certain imprimatur be not unreasonable therefore in william henry that already saw half way to fortune while success in love might be said to be assured there be few of in truth who at age be in position so enviable for a when grow old prosperity if doe come come too often too late for enjoyment so sunshine of youth be marred by uncertainty of duration by cloud overhang future of reception of vortigern young fellow

characterised throughout discovery did not now desert at time indeed even when margarets arm be about neck looked anxious distrait when rallied about have always explanation natural enough not unwelcome to feel said a once told felt in looking at fair scene near stratford that seemed almost too beautiful to be real that have vague fear that must melt when look on dear feel same such

be so unreasonable for though have entirely agreed with mr powell conduct of have given amusing version have be pert have failed to understand what contrast that of mr jordan afforded how distinctly bespoke simple ingenuous nature have never dreamt of course of repeating mr powell parting remark about poor margaret if such notion have entered mind manner in dear girl have received other detail of little interview must have forbidden felt quite certain that be capable of believing that mr jordan be ready to fall in love with even have already done very idea of such thing when knew be engaged to somebody else be of course ridiculous thought that must have set margarets mind at ease to tell that have given that piece of information to lady whereas have aroused indignation not indeed against against what right have to ask such question be impertinent forward indelicate did hope that young woman must never commit impropriety of calling in norfolk street asking to see young gentleman with whom must have earthly business again now unknown to margaret be going to see conscience at seventeen be tender be wonder william henry smote at age however memory for thing be unfortunately short

henry penitently dont know that neednt be so hard upon think have idea that be somehow paying compliment for part however have enough of compliment prefer little honesty for change william henry bethought of saying something about genuineness of compliment by expression of face have suddenly become grave judged that have have enough of subject remained silent how be young man blushed to root of hair blushed more because felt blushing have heard of young lady from father nothing good of hopethis with great severitythat be not ashamed of sir madam hope sirthis with angry flash of bright eyesthat be not ashamed of madam then why did not tell that be coming here william henry bit lip be about to stammer something knew not what when fortunately there be knock at door come in said mr

of inch nobody can say that have not natural manner doe not know how to blush nobody can say of mr powell retorted other when try to blush that beauty be only skin deep be certainly most terrible scene most heartily did william henry wish back in norfolk street at very moment however when expected to see dig nail into one lady burst out laughing began to think that rage laughter must need be artificial whereas in fact while lasted be real enough mirth with be natural safety valve of passion very excellent mechanical contrivance too wont just lighten edmunda little mr erin persisted mr powell touch here touch there dear madam supposing even be capable of doing such thing be not just consider what people must say if touched play even now enemy attack authenticity what handle must such proceeding need afford be surely reasonable observed mr jordan for second time dont know about reasonable returned mr powell with most bewitching pout know if be not here must persuade will leave

certain awe appearance of new comer if have expected to see anyone very magnificent must have be disappointment to for certainly be not of imposing kind there entered room so rapidly that almost seemed to run young man of thirty somewhat inclined to corpulence with cheery good natured face decidedly commonplace in expression well well dorothy see im here said without taking least notice of

speech be such rude one that might have be uttered by first gentleman in europe indeed be william henry by mean certain that be not standing in august presence there be good natured twinkle in stranger eye mitigated harshness of word never indeed before have doubt concerning genuineness of manuscript be expressed in manner so personally offensive to young fellow notwithstanding conviction that speaker be man of very high rank might not have hesitated to resent for certain appealing look mr jordan cast at remembered that be for own sake that have asked to meet man that if offended might be sufferer therefore only answered with forced smile must think one mr malone must have told that who deuce be mr malone be contemptuous rejoinder question put coping stone on young fellow embarrassment indeed utterly discomfited felt transported into strange region with new atmosphere world have never heard of mr malone commentator be unintelligible to be one of lesson can only be taught by year of montys algys of high life be a ignorant a jack harrys of low that respective horizon be limited a william henry stood tongue tied sudden burst of melody filled room mr jordan have sat down to piano be singing with exquisite pathos song be very familiar to detraction strove to turn heart sour gentle mind charity still kept part meekness to soul did bind very nice very true murmured strange gentleman approvingly keeping time with head hand to tune irritation have departed like evil spirit exorcised into coarse countenance have stolen expression of pure enjoyment eye be full of gentleness even affection such power have voice instrument when accompanied by pretty face even on most commonplace nature now what be what be that exclaimed excitedly when song be done why have never heard before dear because be brand new sir said mr jordan with bewitching curtsey sing a flavia in new play of vortigern rowena be to be performed next month at drury lane hope will come to

clarence husband chapter xxviii green eyed monster droll rogue of acquaintance whom one tried to think force of circumstance rather than natural disposition have driven from pavement of integrity into gutter used to maintain that be better to confess one peccadillo with such colourable excuse a might suggest than to conceal in former case might with struggle get out of scrape have done with in latter case be never safe from discovery when came there be sure to be catastrophe there be be true peccadillo in william henry keeping that appointment wot of with two charming ornament of drury lane theatre since have impression margaret might not like ought according to friend philosophy to have told about after interview with royal highness must not be concealed felt that straightforward course be right one a returned home in hackney carriage with precious manuscript amused with thought of pleasure margaret must exhibit on hearing of greatness have be thrust upon when mind have be dazzled by vision of royalty have intended to slip out in casual way that have be indebted for introduction to royal highness to one of professional person who have called in norfolk street previous day on business whom have be compelled to receive in place of fathera mr jordan whole thing ran a smoothly naturally in own mind a must be be like well oiled mechanical machine inventor though of course be invention only adaptation feel confident will do expects of only somehow in practice doesnt act found margaret not in least interested about royal highness very much excited about lady who have be mere medium of introduction whose part in matter have taken must be confessed pain to minimise have not be frank with william henry said with severity have upon lip to say that since be william henry must hardly be frank felt be in mood for banter moreover with name there naturally occurred to thought of frank dennis made heart stand still be not anger that feared even diminution of love have be indicated very significantly by mention of double name have not used for month instead of willie possible diversion of love to object perhaps be already making comparison in mind between certain other person who whatever fault must knew never have deceived be not impossible that love must stray for have not done so few hour ago within own experience with such provocation be very different of course in case there be certain latitude given to men handsomest man on stage off must be well aware not have caused margaret to forget willie even for instant then woman when be jealous be capable of anything from pique will not only be off with love sometimes be on with be very sorry margaret stammered really dont know what mean then face belies word be cold reply why did not tell yesterday that be going to meet woman at drury lane morning there be two of said william henry eagerly urged a felt by fortunate inspiration to tell whole truth oh there be two be there though strove to keep tone same there be relaxation in severity did not escape reflection that there be safety in number have doubt occurred to omitted that circumstance sir in previous narrative with doubt many others indeed margaret have told be that thought must have interest for ought to have said of course that invitation to theatre came from lady wanted to have alteration made in play for of course be out of question mr powell be very angry about must think that have temper of own dont want to hear about mr powell there be once young gentleman who be endeavouring to make agreeable a raconteur in presence of royalty when have done story royal lip let fall terrible word be not amused poor william henry found in much same position reminiscence of mr powell be a be cut off at main margarets instinct have eliminated that factor from sum of matter a insignificant there be person to talk about be true be averse to enter upon subject unhappily be suggested to a topic who may ask be mr jordan well be other lady of course who called here said william henry felt that be turning lively red be so important to that must keep colour be to perform flavia in play person in man clothes observed margaret icily well play page can hardly expect to play in petticoat be not dress rehearsal stammered young man if mean that simply asked meboth of themto step round to theatre morning render professional assistance a happened be unable to do can not for life of see what harm there be in then why did not tell be going be same dreadful question over again of course ought to have told if have have idea that must have come to know of certainly must have done so looked so sorry not to say silly margarets heart melted little know how hate anything clandestine underhand william henry know answered with deep sigh face be one of such abject misery that one must have said whatever have done be sufficiently punished for heart melted more more went on penitently of course ought to have told margaret did not conceal because there be anything to be ashamed of only knew must not like that must think there be harm in itas do seemswhere there be harm be surely great piece of goodnature on part after have disappointed about play to offer to do best for to get duke did go with to st james palace put in drily be on point of saying that there have be only room for two in coach fortunately be young gentleman who thought before spoke must certainly not have be satisfactory explanation very idea that have be about to make turned scarlet wonder be ashamed of sir said perceiving confusion why do talk to about when know that only one of woman have anything to do with matter well naturally dear mr jordan be person to introduce to royal highness since have be privately married to dont believe one word of can only say told so said william henry simply margaret did not give much credit to assertion of lady believed what william henry said after poor young fellow have probably meant harm even dreamt of mesh into designing female must have drawn have only be indiscreet little surreptitious have be rated enough dont know what actress be willie said gravely what pleasure take in making misery estrangement between honest people nothing woman must like better im sure of than to come between dear margaret how can say such thing if have only seen dont want to see interpolated margaret quickly person entirely devoted to profession in be justly held in highest esteem dont deny that be good actress returned margaret significantly indeed have doubt of spoke of so kindly of how dared speak of cried margaret with flashing eye what doe know of well saw just for moment when looked in by accident yesterday said how beautiful kind looked congratulated be shameful of to tell woman of engagement put in why not what be there to be ashamed of be not proud of why must not have told simplicity be very touching if there have be thing a male ingnue upon stage speaker must have be very man to play how must have laughed at in sleeve poor willie answered pityingly did not think necessary to state that have laughed at by mean in sleeve will never see again if dont wish said william henry still sticking to plural number only suppose when vortigern come to be acted will be necessary to do so just for night two oh dont mind seeing at play willie will of course be there together have meant that assistance must probably be required behind scene indeed mr jordan have taken for granted that must be constant visitor at theatre while play be in preparation have very willingly acquiesced in arrangement have not courage to say so be only too thankful that margarets suspicion be at last set at rest knew that be of jealous disposition also that abhorred deceit loved none le on account there be reason why manifestation of such excessive displeasure on so small matter alarmed made heart heavy within however in month two must be married must then be very own must have misgiving about a to deceit there must be further cause for what be past gone must surely be forgiven still heart be heavy considering margarets youth middle class position in life irritation annoyance have exhibited may seem unnatural a well a uncalled for young woman of age rank be not nowadays supposed to know so much about temptation of stage in time matter be different charm of that popular actress even mode of life be topic of common talk there be none of more talked about than mr jordan be not therefore to be wondered at margaret regarded a syren attracted by notoriety not to mention innocence beauty of willie who designed to wile from quiet harbour of domestic love into stormy sea of passion moreover must be said for margaret that jealousy be not like of people who while resenting interference of others with private property lavish on especial kindness of own have always be friend defender of william henry even before became lover have long established claim on fidelity galled that one glimpse of pretty face must have so worked with a to induce to renew acquaintance with under what seemed to such suspicious circumstance especially in so secret clandestine fashion have always be complaint of hers in old day william henry be inclined to deception be in relation however to mr erin only that have observed in case there have be certainly excuse for young man that must have deceived herif at least concealment must be called deceptionshe justly considered to be le pardonable however have now said say with vigour that circumstance scarcely called for indeed felt that have be somewhat hard upon however wrong have be to try to hoodwink have be extent of offending must hardly have declined to go to theatre indeed confessed to herself that while play be in progress be not reasonable to expect to hold communication with who be to perform in matter interested very much did forget that be mainly on own account for did not uncle consent to union depend upon play success when mr erin presently announced first rehearsal at theatre suggested that william henry must be present to witness made opposition objection in short to young man renewing acquaintance with fair flavia be tacitly withdrawn acknowledged to herself that thing must scarcely be otherwise that after there must be possible harm in matter from moment whenever willie be out of sight be more tormented with fire of jealousy than ever knew that saw mr jordan constantly be yet compelled to ignore burned to know what passed between yet scorned to inquire news william henry brought back with of prospect of play seemed hardly of consequence to compared with matter on never spoke at what be to that kemble be unsympathetic dogged studiously apathetic in rendering of vortigern phillimore a horsus be more like buffoon than hero be to her on other hand mr powell a edmunda surpassed mr siddons what wished to know must not ask be how hussey mr jordan be behaving not a flavia in tights though idea be far from consolatory in own proper person of one thing felt convinced that not content with seeing willie day woman corresponded with that received letter from under very roof else how be that when post now brought missive in hand be strange to must slip into pocket without word of comment with air of indifference did not impose upon for instant william henry have now little sitting room of own noticed that when letter arrived remained in longer alone than usual reading doubt over over perhaps replying to in same fervid style in felt sure be written possibly for margaret though poet like willie have lively imagination of own even kissing one morning epilogue to vortigern rowena arrived from mr merry be discussed at breakfast time word by word a befitted so important document hour afterwards when william henry have gone out a margaret be only too well convinced to drury lane mr erin returned to subject dont much like concluding line in first part said scattered flower left benignly save posthumous flower garland of grave ran benignly save did not madge be not sure uncle then just go get thing out of samuel room margaret went looked about for manuscript in question be nowhere to be found in research came upon document spread out in half opened drawer of writing table be written in delicate hand on large letter paper be almost impossible that must avoid reading commencement of dear w h began then followed mass of heterogeneous word without sense meaning a if have be taken at random out of dictionary be probable that margaret have never heard of cryptogram have heard of communication written in cypher flashed upon mind at once that be looking at letter of nature be bad enough that abandoned hussey of drury lane who dwelt mile away from saw willie five day out of six must nevertheless have audacity to correspond with that must write such thing a must not bear light have to be concealed in cypher be indeed intolerable granting premise there be certainly ample cause for indignation mantled to very forehead bitterness took possession of very soul a stood with one hand on table for limb trembled with agitation shook mind heard front door softly closed hurried footstep in passage be william henry who have remembered no doubttoo latethat have left letter exposed to view have returned to place in safer receptacle next moment be face to face with chapter xxix cypher know what be come for said margaret in broken voice have yet touch of tenderness in be come for letter snatched from drawer held before be use to lie to face tell truth william henry face be indeed white to lip eye returned gaze with confused frightened stare stammered out something knew not what sank into chair continued girl in harsh pitiless tone have nothing to say for have ready tongue excuse to offer for new duplicity have read letter inquired hoarsely illustration know what be come for be come for letter how must colour rushed back to cheek into eye there came gleam of hope went on be who will read to if decline to do so will conclude that vile creature have written what be not fit for anyone save woman like to hear refusal will be last word that will ever address to with consent so help heaven mr powell when personating heroine of stage never looked spoke with greater earnestness of purpose than on occasion did simple margaret slade out of simplicity of nature will read letter margaret be william henry quiet reply word still more tone staggered margaret not little change in face manner within last few minute have indeed be most remarkable at first have seemed so struck with consciousness of guilt so hopeless of forgiveness that have not dared to throw upon mercy then have appeared to recover little now be quite calm composed a though apprehension have passed away from voice a said will read letter margaret have even tender reproach in a though not be injured party read said tone be no longer stubborn imperious be plain that woman letter be not love letter must not have consented to read if be not love letter what cause have for anger yet if be not so why have exhibited such confusionnay despair will read since wish went on though be breach of confidence be better to break one word than to break one heart morality of aphorism be somewhat questionable margaret nodded assent took doubt in particular sense be certainly better that must know

known whether to admire detest for if have be in place must have done must have fought for too then must have adequate motive why must that woman have dared so much for when others have performed part in so sluggish perfunctory manner must have be because have heart in who must have heart in mere stage play thing at best full of fictitious woe imaginary hero there must have be human loveor what such creature took for loveto have enlisted in cause oh why did not willie come a night wore on apprehension for lover personal safety took place of jealous fear what might not despair disappointment have induced to do in wretchedness need of sympathy consolation ventured to hint at to mr erin be surely very odd uncle willie ought to be home by time at event must not send somewhere what nonsense

not fault of course dont blame be not in mortal to command success there be nothing for now to return to conveyancing business in ten year so there be knowing that may step into old bingleys shoe

antiquary there have be time when if have dared to do so old man must have put down foot upon such passion crunched spark out just now margaret be too full of misery sense of wrong to care what said while uncle on part though be fully resolved to put end to niece engagement with william henry must not at once resume relative position to have occupied before be mooted a to speaking falsely

have made sufficient mean upon to marry must be abhorrent to that in word love for did not comprehend hope patience be possible indeed that omission to come in person arose from delicacy of mind disinclination to embarrass by personal appeal a for choice of intermediary have perhaps poured out woe into ear of first person who have professed to sympathise with who must be confessed have shown
