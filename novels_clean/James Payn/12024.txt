richard yorke be well aware have a have be hinted come down to crompton with express view of throwing in way of eccentric master to do so opportunely be content to bide time thus though autumn have far advanced time have come for men of craft to hasten from dropping dripping wood no longer fair to hive at home sweet memorial of summer time richard remained at crompton not willingly indeed even patiently with sort of dogged resolve be engendered even in restless spirit by long watching have stopped so long that must not now give up watch fortress indeed showed more sign of breach than when first sat down before still must not raise siege persistency excited surprise in house companion walter grange be gossip curious about other men affair be easy even for to see that tenant have proud stomach have set down talk about desiring introduction to carew a merely phrase for wishing for good chance of disposing of ware to best advantage in market to so many of such various calling thronged did not think a have honestly confessed that there be much chance of squire becoming patron of fine art wished young fellow luck be glad for more than one reason that staid on be at least three month

depend on decoy being guarded by ten sir can for must be off to head keeper with rest yes can then good by sir for present now what poor fool be that soliloquized young painter contemptuously a door closed upon late companion to think must risk life against poacher on even term of course if suffice will only treat to knuckle if not if be giant there be more than one of then here be better ally than mere bone sinew yorke took out of drawer life preserver made of lead whalebone struck with once to test weight elasticity then slipped into shooting jacket pocket will enlarge organ of locality

grange have given have hung round neck be within easy reach of finger sallied out well wrapped up a to throat with hand in pocket if richard yorke be doomed not to have life made easy for made a easy a must never omitted precaution unless gave trouble to take out of proportion to advantage conferred be never imprudent unless passion of moment be too strong for sometimes unfortunately mere whim be in intensity passion passion while lasted fit of madness be landscape painter partly because have taste way chiefly because hated regular work of sort have real love for art not least touch of poetic feeling knew oak from beech tree sort of touch must be used in delineating foliage of yellow primrose be to yellow primrose must mix color deftly enough made up hue education have be by mean neglected have be of strange sort thing have learned be a be for immediate use of superficial attractive character advocate of classical curriculum must have shaken head at what richard yorke did know almost a severely a at lack of knowledge have read good deal of kind of literature including much garbage must play little on piano speak french with excellent accent in word have learned thing have pleased a well a little latin mathematics have not knew english history far better than most young englishman sight of tomb ruin have never made heart pulse faster with evoked idea by single beat historical association have charm for mighty oak for example under shadow of now stand sentry have transferred so deftly to portfolio have no longer interest for have done use pleasure be therefore departed in eye know quite well that though be called squire in token probably of wholesale slaughter of wild duck effected by carew from convenient cover that tree be hundred of year old oldest in chase have read talking oak for indeed can quote tennyson by yard in dulcet voice must have be natural enough one must think in time place that thought of what venerable monarch of forest must have witnessed must perforce come into mind same moonlight now shine down between knotted naked branch must have doubtless lit on many pair of lover for be ever favorite place for tryst in by gone year young monk perhaps may here when crompton be abbey have given double absolution to to girl who confessed to love roundhead maiden cavalier gallant must many time have forgotten political difference beneath oak a yet tree not sacred to royalty nay perhaps even of york lancaster may here have be compounded for in one red rose of blush bluff harry have haply hunted beneath once wide spreading arm certainly martyr king have done so with score of generation of men of sort dead gone god alone know though more bugle sounded twanging bow be heard there be surely echo of far away music in young painter ear there be none heard melody be sweet unheard be sweeter be line richard yorke have read perhaps certainly have not understood heard bare branch creak sway above head a wind slowly took heard night jar croak a flew by on silent wing now then heard thought heard sound of voice of fellow watcher great way off be only touch of fancy be silent in close hiding be not to be supposed however that mind be fixed upon matter in be engaged so that other subject be thereby excluded from repression of night poaching be not matter interested either in principle practice must just a soon that keeper have not reminded of offer to share watch whim have once seized to do so have died away having once promised company be not one to break word so here be young man thought be busy then with past present with future be own future path of life did not lie straight before richard yorke a doe before most men of age in fact came so to speak abruptly to termination exactly where stood in such case choice of wayfarer becomes boundless be only limited by horizon circumstance a matter be have scarcely enough to live on not nearly enough to do so a taste habit suggested yet by one bold stroke with luck to back might not one day must have have small charm for at once for life long be rich prosperous must not be said to have expectation position be not without certain contingency extreme brilliancy of might almost atone for vagueness be from dream of future greatness what seemed to a such wherein saw wealthy powerful surrounded with luxury with minister of pleasure that be suddenly sharply awakened by trifling incident snapping of dead twig in copse hard by in instant glittering gossamer of thought be swept aside young fellow be ear eye wind have dropped for time silence be intense that solemn hush seemed to pervade forest poet have attributed to cessation of spiritual life a though haunters of glade be waiting for resumption of occupation until interloping mortal must pas by nothing stirred if so be motion without sound a when full feathered owl slid softly through midnight air above not dead leaf fell where leaf have fallen there lay how be then that twig broke deer be couched pheasant sat at roost head beneath splendid coverlet wing though there be creeping thing even midnight did not woo to rest in vast wilderness yorke have imbibed enough of forest lore to know that noise have heard be produced by none of rat in water rush stoat pushing through undergrowth must have announced in different fashion again sound be heard time be no longer crackling of twig breaking of branch then cautious footstep fell upon frosty leaf with light leap on bank fringed copse poacher stood in open that such be have doubt whatever moonlight streamed full upon showed to be none of crompton keeper unless indeed be disguised for instant passed across mind that might be walter grange be about same height build come to play trick upon to test courage for man face be blackened like burglar idea be dismissed a soon a entertained keeper reflected thought far too seriously of night doings to make jest of besides must never have sprung upon bank a yonder fellow did limb though sturdy being stiff with age occasional rheumatism intruder seemed quite alone be probable while confederate paid attention to pheasant in home park that be bent upon making private raid upon sleeping water fowl have gun however a far a yorke must make out other weapon a soon a have got near enough to pond to admit of watcher sprang out from beneath shadow of oak placed between stranger copse from have emerged yorke be taller by full six inch believing to be more than match for antagonist have not so much a laid finger on concealed weapon if have now thought of doing so be too late for with cry of eager rage man turned at once sprang at like tiger needed skill coolness to parry fierce blow fell upon like hail have scarcely time to return yorke be adept at boxing in chance encounter into somewhat dissipated reckless youth have led have be easy victor now took knew to keep instant carelessness absence of hand in search of must now have gladly seized guard must have be broken through placed at foe mercy nothing long reach preserved from sledge hammer blow seemed a though must break arm fell upon a for using whistle opportunity of course be not afforded moreover have breath to spare for such purpose breath however be also desideratum with poacher more so inasmuch a accompanied blow a brian de bois guilbert be wont to hammer home mace stroke with have beauseant beauseant with amazing oath be recorded of american gentleman much given to blasphemy that must entertain intelligent companion for day with mere force ingenuity of expletive singular talent seemed to be shared by richard yorke antagonist that one of most accomplished rough of midland have fallen to young painter lot in night melee must not for moment doubt reflection did not go far to soothe did not care for fighting for own sake while pride revolted against thus being kept at bay by brutal clown if must get chance made up mind to end matter once for at last opportunity seemed to be afforded poacher

affection of young carew be nevertheless a have said literally old enough to be mother idea of affair having be love match in usual sense of expression be simply preposterous that miss hardcastle be

toward door be afraid so indeed said richard carelessly parson whymper ought to have known better than to send down here at time a john trevethick stopped at once richard saw reflected in glass above

of nutmeg lemon pervaded apartment pleasantly accorded with almost tropical temperature contrast altogether afforded to own more stately desolate private sitting room with disused air comfortless surroundings struck richard very agreeably on chintz covered sofa in most retired corner of parlor sat solomon coe harry trevethick be difficult to say in of countenance most astonishment appeared when young painter presented at door harry cheek be not pale before became crimson though moved spoke solomon rose with frown seemed to be asking of trevethick reason of unexpected intrusion be friend of mr whymper said landlord setting down sherry on table therefore be sure friend of of be daughter harry sir here grinned be solomon coe very intimate friend of hers a may see be family party in fact will be day so pray make at home have seen mr coe before said richard frankly shaking that gentleman unwilling hand though took for bagman bear malice on account bagman lor sol what must have ' be thinking about laughed trevethick grimly why here gentleman have be stopping at crompton with squire must mind sol sir mind ai free just well harry lass why get up shake hand with gentleman have seen young lady before also explained richard be who be good enough to get key of castle have just returned by by to father added harry gave look showed that second pilgrimage up rock be not unappreciated did see chapel sir tomb inquired hardly know indeed said richard be climb enjoyed most will never forget a long a live oh must go properly over ruin young gentleman said trevethick with air of proprietor girl here solomon must show to morrow for need bit of explanation sol know about sol oh yes know answered solomon doggedly nobody wo go up to castle to morrow reckon with sou'wester blowing be wild night indeed said richard putting aside curtain looking out through shutterless window cloud be driving by at frightful speed ay ai only cloud said trevethick filling pipe speaking with great gravity flying dutchman be seen off point not two hour ago by old madge suppose observed solomon derisively yes by old madge retorted landlord sturdily a knew life boat be lost last year with hand long before drove into turlock bay bottom upward how be that inquired richard with interest well sir be way said trevethick be stormy night though not so bad one a be like to be life boat have gone out to disabled indiaman have be away three hour more when a be sitting in very parlor in came madge looking scared enough have be to turlock on errand for so beit down say 'and take glass for look a though wind have blown wit away old woman that john trevethick ' say 'but be near frightened to death have seen sight a will never forget to dying day have just seen life boat men nine of lord have mercy on soul 'well why not say 'why must have ' seen 'em have got back sooner than hoped for be ' 'nay said 'but met coming out of gethin away from home home will never see again wet white like corps be drowned men a sure a stand there john trevethick so turned out poor fellow did tell body of before knew that be drowned inquired richard ay be point muttered solomon approvingly said trevethick did believe old woman thought story must be very ill taken so kept to turned out true for that thing happened just a say john trevethick ai liar of course be stating what believe to be fact said richard in conciliating tone doubt just so be told so often that really doe behave said solomon laughing what seems curious be that be always madge purblind old woman a want to be thought witch a see thing drowned sailor flying dutchman so forth must like to know who else have ever have chance lot of folk said landlord doggedly well be here forty year said solomon have seen harry here have be at gethin life have seen there be awkward silence harry have turned very pale in terror a richard thought of dispute between father solomon becoming serious be naught to do with said trevethick sharply be gethin man solomon must talk so why did madge describe very ship a be lost off castle rock night before ever set eye on be printed in paper in next saturday paper yes replied solomon curtly nay heard old woman with own ear said harry gravely there have be no wreck when told have seen schooner firefly ' said 'will never come nearer home than gethin bay mark word be twelve hour ay more before struck forgive for interrupting said richard understand matter be supposed that vessel announces own destruction beforehand sometimes said trevethick gravely ship be a well known here if belongs to part of coast a house be known in midland well if be doomed madge ai only madge will see day before come to end firefly for example belonged to polwheel have be away for week still be expected home interrogated richard ay that be said solomon once more nodding approval old woman have that in mind why so argued trevethick what be firefly to that must think saw drive into bay break to piece against rock out yonder why must tell vision to harry that certainly seems strange indeed said richard a showing attached importance to affair herself be most curious coincidence to say least of what be flying dutchman of also spoke did not know ever came so far out of proper latitude a be seen before great storm however said trevethick ask coast guard men hear what say there be many craft have put out to from gethin come quite close so that man might almost reach with boat hook then of sudden there be nothing to be seen big wave john trevethick have more to say to same effect to richard listened with attentive courtesy while at same time held to same skeptical view entertained by solomon thus won good opinion of men of of girl felt already assured scarcely ever addressed to harry a much a possible avoided gazing at if idea of paying serious attention to have ever be put into father mind intelligence that have be friend guest of carew have be probably sufficient to dissipate social position that fact implied seemed to make out of question that must be harry suitor only remained for to disabuse solomon of same notion be at first easy task stubbornness with rival resisted attempt at conciliation gave way by degree at last vanished to have be able to make common cause with upon question of local superstition be great point gained solomon have hard head prided upon freedom from such weakness hailed ally in battle field on have contended at odds five night out of seven for year harry a have seen shared father sentiment in matter be great stroke of policy in richard to have espoused other side must of course have much preferred to agree with to have embraced view have attraction of advocacy now gave genuine pleasure to find opposition exciting to petulance be not petulant with solomon left father to tilt with after own fashion from superstition of coast fought way to of mine old trevethick believed in knocker buccas spirit who indicate position of good lode by blow with invisible pick a have more immediate connection with own affair than nautical phenomenon clung to creed with even greater tenacity than before so fierce be contention that be with difficulty richard must put in inquiry a to whence spirit came who thus interested in success of human venture know nothing of said trevethick frankly more than know where wind come from be shaking yonder pane only know that be there nay father know said harry with little blush at own erudition buccas be ghost of old jew who crucified lord be sent a slave by roman emperor to work cornish mine very like said trevethick approvingly although probably without clear conception of historical picture thus presented to be least must do in spirit after having done so much mischief in flesh contradiction involved in exemplary remark combined with absurdity of repentance taking form of interest in mining speculation be almost too much for richard sense of humor only nodded with gravity a became man who be imbibing information inquired further whether in addition to favorers of industry there be spirit who worked ill to miner well ca say a there be said landlord with air of man who can afford to give point in argument there be many thing not of world happen underground leastway in mine for sol there be from north may be same in part certainly be not interrupted solomon

often in after time did that fair sunny scene recur to bitter memory how often be that first kiss of love renewed by cruel fancy in mocking sweetness changed to gall better for one better perhaps for if clasped in one arm have fallen from that tall tower top then there have ended life love together chapter xvii working on pivot never have richard be in such high spirit a on evening of day on harry have made confession to of love have promised to be wife must father consent be gained be true that have be far from sanguine upon latter point richard have reason for being of different opinion must be better way if must obtain trevethick good will not that at shared in girl dread of anger because really seemed that if married from father roof must be fulfilling mother injunction in making alliance with heiress what with two thousand pound in gold inn lucky mine be plain that old man must have despicable sum to leave behind yet to do richard justice only formed additional incentive to project upon at event have long set heart have resolved at hazard to make girl wife love for be a deep a be passionate now that be assured from own lip of being returned heart be filled with joy spoke out of abundance have be hitherto habit in family circle round bar parlor fire to play part of listener rather than of talker have mainly confined to exhibition of attentive interest in solomon story in host sagacious observation with respect to investment of capital such a one must be too cautious where one put one money where interest be high risk be great where be low be not worth while to let leave one hand next to subject of local superstition investment be favorite subject of debate between trevethick sol richard whose ignorance insured impartiality have be judicious scale holder between upon present occasion be young artist who led talk chose matter told of splendor of crompton of marvelous prodigality of owner listened with greedy ear to vulgar nature topic of mere wealth be ever attractive one in present instance there be additional whet to appetite in connection of carew with gethin be naturally object of curiosity to tenant trevethick never before have old man have opportunity of hearing at first hand of eccentricity of squire in relating richard took good care to show by implication on what intimate term stood with hinted at obligation under have put by throwing park gate open so opportunely impression left upon audience desired to leave be that carew be indebted to for having saved life then be likely squire must do thing for that chose to ask observed trevethick with thought of own debt to solomon father doubtless in mind well certainly ought to do so answered richard carelessly on other hand be not very probable that will put to test just so returned trevethick sucking at pipe be independent of like of be richard reply old man spoke more sat in cloud of smoke thought for rest of evening even when sol rose up to go harry having retired long since for kept very early hour at gethin castle landlord did not a usual accompany mixed glass of favorite liquor a for richard be not custom to seek bed until after midnight so trevethick be left to one company be opportunity to latter have be looking forward for many day have never desired so keenly a at moment be likely to be at crompton soon again inquired landlord pursuing subject of evening talk have intention of going there at present returned richard fact be mr trevethick between ourselves be poor man in comparison with many of meet there way habit be too expensive for ay gambling such like suppose observed landlord cunningly be 'light come light go with money of sort of folk reckon just so though money come light enough be have not to earn since mother make allowance choose to risk at card table quite right quite right young gentleman answered other approvingly there be prudent gentry even at crompton suppose parson whymper for instance gamble do certainly not be much too sagacious man even if be rich enough to play for indeed say squire must have come to end of tether before manages thing at crompton a know yet carew want money said landlord musing well have be guest returned richard smiling be scarcely fair of to speak of embarrassment doe not certainly want so much that can still afford to indulge whim mr trevethick if be what mean be just what did mean said old man frankly six month ago so made certain proposition to squire must have be exceedingly to advantage to accept not to yours interrupted richard slyly nay say that sir answered other be one that ought to have be glad to accept in case be downright madness in to refuse if wanted cash be chance too will venture to say will never offer from other quarter mr whymper acknowledged that know about matter mr trevethick squire behaved like dog in manger to wo work mine yet let work for mercy sake be quiet cried landlord earnestly looking cautiously about if know about need not let others know what mine be talking about give name speak under breath man old man leaned forward with white moist face peered into richard eye a though must read soul wheal dane be name of place if remember right said richard carew have notion that roman did not use up that only want capital to make paying concern be one of mad idea doubtless mr john trevethick be not by nature quick appreciator of sarcasm must not misunderstand irony expressed in richard word be that what came down to gethin about inquired with sort of grim despair have nevertheless comical effect richard must only trust to nod head assentingly well cried other striking table with fist if did think be a deep a devil very first day set eye on so be parson whymper man be here in default of language to express sense of deception that a supposed have be practiced on mr trevethick uttered execration terrible enough for cornish giant be not mr whymper man at observed richard coolly mr whymper be man at least will be one day how so inquired landlord eye at full stretch mouth agape neglected pipe in right hand who in fiend name be be only son heir of carew of crompton answered young man deliberately why carew never have son exclaimed trevethick incredulously leastways not lawful one be married once to wench of name of hardcastle 't be true be put aside tell be be lawful son nevertheless persisted richard mother be privately married to ask parson whymper will tell same be true that father have not acknowledged will have right day wheal dane along with rest news of young man paternity must have be sufficiently startling to who thus received for first time must under other circumstance have doubtless excited phlegmatic nature to utmost what concern in even slight degree be with of more absorbing than most vital interest of thus be with trevethick ambitious pretension of lodger sank into insignificance notwithstanding for moment believed in for how unless be what professed to be must know so much before disappointment have befallen in overthrow of long cherished scheme why mr whymper wrote with own hand growled that in judgment mine be worthless that have done must to persuade squire to sell yet come down here to gauge spy stratagem be fair in war business answered young man smiling come mr trevethick reason may have brought here assure upon honor that weigh with now in comparison with great regard feel for yours if will be frank with will also be so with let say at outset that nothing may drop from lip will be made use of to prejudice interest have gathered much for wheal hush sir for sake hush implored landlord earnestly holding up huge hand for silence give name again there be one moving above stair be only solomon observed richard quietly want sol other man alive to hear what be talking about mr yorke answered trevethick hoarsely have gathered for be about to say that mine be rich well worth what have offered for good deal more interrupted richard perhaps hundred time perhaps thousand time a much make so close secret of matter without reason see dead hand with flame of fire at finger tip going up down ladder exist without most excellent reason mr trevethick what wish eye to see nay ear to hear spoken of be probably subject of considerable private importance to ourselves come be friend here together say again let be frank trevethick be silent for little felt lump rise in throat a though nature forbade to disclose secret have kept so long so jealously guarded have known for fifty year began in half choking voice found out a mere lad when went down into old mine one day for sport with schoolmate vein lie in lowest part of old working at depth that think nothing of nowadays though be too deep for old master of pit remember a though be yesterday how heart leaped within when torch shone upon how fled away lest school fellow must see also came back next day alone to certify great discovery be good vein if ever there be one copper there may be worth ten of thousand hundred of thousand million never have numeration table be invested with such significance trevethick giant frame shook with emotion eye literally glared with greed have be there since observed richard interrogatively often often answered other hoarsely must not keep away nobody else have be there place be dark perilous there be rat bat eerie creature about folk be afraid because of dead hand flame hand torch yes did best to keep place own thought be never absent from for day when have earned little money put by more to more to again till have got enough to make bid for lease of old mine carew be under age so that fell through bided time bid again not much not enough a fondly thought to excite suspicion still what must seem good price for disused pit then bid more more carew will sell let money grows grows in vain tell have laid by fortune only to pour into hand be ready for to night there must be haggling asking for time must be paid in hard cash how long thought will madman balk with whim will die day in cup break neck in hunting will surely come in with offer to heir have way at last win prize now after patience pain be overmatched by parson boy spoke with uncommon heat passion not complainingly face be dark tone violent even menacing there be mistake about having accepted companion invitation to be frank mr trevethick said richard gravely disappointment must be natural enough if long cherished plan have really failed have misunderstood altogether be grateful to for confiding to whole of what have already guessed in part will have reason to repent confidence secret be safer now than have ever be for from lip mr whymper will never have suspicion with respect to wheal dane confirmed have be too long guest feel too much friend of yours to act in way to disadvantage trevethick looked at inquiringly suspicion disfavor glowing in dusky face if story be true young gentleman mine will be own day may may not be mr trevethick father intention be not to be counted upon a must be well aware for twenty four hour if ever wheal dane be mine richard hesitated moment while landlord devoured with eye well cried impatiently what then be willing to make over to a soon a come of age by deed interest may have in on one condition make over wheal dane to by deed what at own price for nothing will have for free gift condition what be that want of be not money want permission from mr trevethick to wed be for must not speak of love without leave to woo daughter to wed daughter cried trevethick starting from seat harry say provided that suit be not displeasing to answered richard not without tremor in voice for old man face be terrible to look upon hatred wrath be struggling there with avarice have upper hand rocked to fro then answered in stifled voice daughter hand be already promised young man may be so mr trevethick not by think that heart have not be given to man have designed for be certain may see that for tell have passed word to solomon coe that will be wife returned other gloomily be not one to go back from bargain one can only promise what be in one power urged richard daughter heart be not yours to give in backing man suit have already redeemed word to if have failed to win affection think have let try chance be fitter match for in year be gentleman therefore fitter for for be true lady love thousand time a much a a for wheal dane must give twenty such if have for leave ask for end hope for be curious to mark how mere mention of mine by name affected old man wrath seemed on very point of explosion be checked smoothed at once like raging wave by oil brow indeed be still dark frowning resumed seat listened seemed to listen to richard impassioned pleading genuine feeling made young fellow eloquent gave tender charm to always handsome face winning tone perhaps even unsympathetic trevethick be really somewhat touched at event did not interrupt when have quite finished took out watch said in softened tone hour be late mr yorke have given much to think about to can not reply just now communication have taken altogether by surprise will answer 'yes ' at present good night sir nodded be usual salute at parting upon young man eagerly stretching out hand took readily enough gave squeeze with giant finger a made richard wince then smiling grimly retired a heavy step toiled up stair richard perceived slip of paper on floor have apparently fluttered out of old man watch case upon be written three letter b n z a held in hand heard landlord tread returning with unusual haste have only just time to replace paper face downward on sanded floor before other reappeared have dropped memorandum somewhere said be of great consequence oh here be picked up replaced in hollow of great silver watch richard who be sitting where have left looked up with glance of careless inquiry good night again mr trevethick good night sir again landlord smiled in grim fashion chapter xviii by moonlight richard sat over fire revolving late conversation with trevethick in mind picturing to what must probably come of although declaration of love for harry have be thus suddenly made have not be made unadvisedly though have not expected opportunity for stating must have offered so soon have planned whole argument out beforehand with wheal dane for pivot upon whole felt satisfied with effect upon host latter have not surprised except by frankness in disclosure respecting rich promise of mine richard own observation aided by clew parson whymper few chance sentence have given have convinced that wheal dane be most coveted object in landlord eye have happened to have fallen into own hand did really suspect enough to have have searched for ore from top to bottom trevethick have therefore lost nothing by revelation a sagacity have doubtless foreseen while have made very favorable impression upon richard by candor cornish giant thought latter might be rude brutal duplicity be foreign to character be not blunderbore jack giant killer who dug pitfall pretended to swallow what only put in bag trevethick have certainly shown strong disfavor to young man suit backed though be by such great pretension be evident that for hold upon with respect to mine richard must not have be listened to so patiently however mouth have not be peremptorily closed at once a have expected must have be be great point gained longer old man took to think about matter more likely be self interest to gain day with supposing richard representation to have be correct be certainly better match for harry than solomon be have apprehension of being refuted trevethick must in probability write to mr whymper to inquire into truth of what then must certainly make reference to mine a to richard being be lawful son have not chaplain whom must count on a friend to say be to advantage besides admitted that in eye be born in honest wedlock at event there must be ample excuse for having taken view of case while a to prospect have frankly confessed that be for present unacknowledged by squire so long in fact a must keep up pretense of influence present contingent at crompton felt position with trevethick tolerably secure in scheme of dark deceit love for harry be interwoven like golden thread amidst plot plan glorious face must suddenly rise unbidden charm from have long since resolved to win late avowal of love for now partial success to gain father favor seemed to have made own already how beautiful have looked that day upon tower with sunlight on hair how fresh guileless be way very weakness be lovable cause of love how touching be simple faith in omen how pleasant to combat arm about dainty waist a though to protect from shadow of harm how pitiful fear of gruff father of cornish solomon how sweet to calm kissing tear away once more loving arm embraced once more lip touched warm cheek when sudden noise awakened from dream of bliss parlor fire have long gone out be warm for time of year have be otherwise must not have replenished candle too have burned out moon beam be streaming through window have be dark must scarce have be aware of house have long ago be hushed in repose yet richard felt certain that have heard movement in passage stealthy step yet not that of thief burglar fairy footfall rather be music to ear heart leaped up to tell on other side of door be harry trevethick held breath trembled not for fear be possible that knowing be sitting there alone have come down of own choice to bear company have father told something glad tidings must not keep from lover even for night filled with sweet dream of a of have risen in sleep be drawn involuntarily toward by loadstone of love bolt fastened house door be softly drawn latch gently lifted what must mean why be thus going forth alone clandestinely at midnight heart beat faster than ever for instant all that have read heard from wild companion what have believed until came to gethin of wile inconstancy of woman flashed upon mind have bred in town familiar with way of vice be flattered hoodwinked by country wanton impossible for though there be virtue in world felt assured that harry loved alone must be walking in sleep softly very swiftly left parlor hurried to front door be closed unfastened opened looked out be a light a day yet so different object in street stone in cottage opposite stood out distinct clear bathed in pale ghostly atmosphere distant murmur of sea came to like sigh of one just freed from pain nothing else be to be heard human tread disturbed midnight stillness along winding road led to turlock caught far off flutter of woman dress be going at rapid speed next moment have turned corner not before have recognized harry closing inn door softly behind started after like arrow from bow scene of pursuit be strange weird enough have richard possessed eye for thing object of sky be without cloud sea showed on cold blue surface broad shining path where moon beam lay without ripple on shore there be even le of motion bramble threw slender shadow on road moved not twig nature green pale seemed to be cast in enchanted sleep even to suspend breathing from point richard have reached must see road stretching for full mile like white ribbon save in middle where dipped between high bank led to turlock only at place foot path struck across field to fairy bower to astonishment though indeed have scarcely capacity enough for further wonder harry took path saw climb stile then for first time look round sank under hedge to hide when cautiously looked forth again girl have vanished knew whither be going now have assisted across very stile few day ago have walked with through hazel copse skirted clear trout stream by side must follow now at utmost speed with le caution for path be green noiseless must hear heart beat not from want of breath a though in accord with silver treble of stream a sped along through scanty foliage of dell saw light dress gleam across wooden bridge stopped beside peering through lattice of branch upon a stood on green bank of wishing well never have moon beam shone upon sight more fair harry be attired a have be on previous evening except wore shawl also served a head gear like hood now unfastened taking out pin have joined together held above well showed a in mirror leaning face curving form wealth of hair frightened yet hopeful eye rise fall of bosom filled with anxiety superstitious awe have come to test future to foresee fate at gethin wishing well for instant poised pin lip at same time murmuring simple charm then dropped into well clear depth watched fall a did so figure seemed to glide upon liquid mirror at sight of clasped hand trembled superstitious a be harry have only half expected that foolish curiosity must be actually gratified moved by avowal of richard love that morning obstacle to seemed to so formidable have wished to see future husband to know how fate must decide between loved whom father have chosen for yet be terrified now that have desired be vouchsafed scarcely dared to look upon yonder shadowy form although presence seemed to assure of fulfillment of dearest wish be counterfeit presentment of richard yorke bareheaded just a have seen last in bar parlor with heightened color eager smile loving gratitude in eye seemed to thank for having thus summoned before figure be at right angle from own face be turned toward gazed upon intently looking for to faint fade since mission have be accomplished even drew back little a though to express content yet there be vision still glorious picture in fair round frame of moss greenery supposing must remain there pale face flushed at thought indelibly forever to tell secret of heart to world then whisper seemed to tremble beneath freight of love whispered harry harry looked up saw substance of shadow lover standing upon little wooden bridge though folly be near kin to vice doe not acknowledge relationship to do harry trevethick justice must never have made midnight assignation with richard in fairy bower be more alarmed shocked at too literal fulfillment of wish than pleased to see there shed tear for very shame reserve have hitherto maintained with respect to affection for have now perceived be swept away by own act scene to have just be unsuspected witness be more than equivalent to mere declaration of love be leap year offer of hand heart have strong hold of duty left to to betake even halting place such a coy maiden love to linger at little before murmur be yours there be

at stile forbade to accompany farther what leave to walk alone at such hour darling be nearly two o'clock why not cried turning upon fiercely be afraid of none of whom must love of whom make afraid

impossible that must satisfactorily explain companionship with inn keeper daughter at place hour truth must never be believed even if must be related have got home by time have done so unobserved otherwise be more than probable that must find two cornish giant waiting if not to grind bone to make bread at least to break with cudgel in eye must seem to have be guilty of deliberate seduction one of daughter other of destined bride yet not to return to gethin in such case must be worse than cowardice since absence must be sure to be associated with harry midnight expedition have hitherto only

what couple of bumble bee be murmuring about who be barred up in double window can therefore converse with one a much without reserve a please rather here little man eye twinkled significantly a please what hear from client in ridiculous place be never revealed beyond except so far a may serve interest if mr dodge to whose favor a understand owe introduction have told thing concerning will be sure have advised to be quite frank candid there be necessity for warning mr weasel in case do assure answered richard earnestly have nothing to conceal from with respect to circumstance of position be unfortunate doubtless very suspicious be a innocent of disgraceful charge hush hush dear sir will never do be mere waste of time though might have be much worse good heaven suppose have be guilty

concerned whether be true not doe not matter button want to know whether seems true whether will seem true to judge jury have thought matter over of course have gone through in own mind from beginning to end now please to go over to little man whipped out note book leaned forward in chair looked eye ear like terrier watching at rat hole after moment pause richard stated case pretty much a be already acquainted with little lawyer interrupting now then by gesture never by word in order that might set down point memorandum very good said mr weasel when have quite finished that be story be be truth sir hush dear young sir will have enough of that truth whole truth nothing truth fortnight hence what have to consider be probability why did go to plymouth more than other place to change note because have heard there be miner bank there trevethick have mentioned note of company a being a good in opinion a of bank of england thought must be easier to get mining note in exchange for of bank of england than others of same bank check showed trevethick be not then bona fide piece of paper eh be not said richard casting down eye very good answered lawyer so cheerfully that must have thought client have cleared of least suspicion upon score at event now where did get mother sent blank check at request filled in check be destroyed say burned of course tore up threw out of window of carriage devil did said mr weasel in perturbation be not way to destroy check have mother account at bank on be drawn of course said richard simply there be nothing 'of course mr yorke in matter answered lawyer gravely be quite sure quite have always have account there though to such amount a two thousand pound be large sum muttered lawyer thoughtfully still have not lost one penny of in case thing went against mr yorke must appeal to prosecutor be likely to be of service certainly not answered richard hastily must not accept mercy at hand besides be not question of mercy may come to observed other gravely must not deceive mr yorke good heaven do believe then took money with intent to steal what belief be be of consequence one way other opinion be that jury will take view if hear story a tell fact be have left out most important incident of whole case will hinge upon young lady having given note with own hand be evident of course that sympathized with in scheme pursued lawyer rapidly holding up finger to forbid protest be already rising to richard lip nothing must be more natural though most imprudent ill judged than behavior have more idea of stealing money than have how must since be in manner own being father sole heiress see clearly enough to jury used to mere matter of fact motive have little significance unless put into action what want what must have be evidence that got note not only for girl sake from finger nobody can hurt know trevethick must never prosecute own daughter indeed whole affair dwindles down to lover stratagem there be need for prosecuting body if can only put harry trevethick into witness box now can mr can not be question richard be silent lawyer argument struck with full force have scruple on matter for own part feared that harry might entertain must be only too much in keeping with credulous superstitious nature if must talk to alone for five minute muttered richard uneasily be impossible said mr weasel with decision can only play with such card a hold must go to gethin though must be most inconvenient at busy time refresh young woman memory be delicate task must be looked upon by other side with suspicion now be there judicious friend can be thoroughly depended upon female friend if possible since affair may require tact sympathy to effect little negotiation think good sir think why there be mother ejaculated richard suddenly be wisest of woman very one to conduct matter if properly instructed be now be said lawyer cheerily come come that be well begin to see little light let go down to gethin where a conclude be not known see miss trevethick must like to see beforehand however indeed be absolutely necessary in note to yesterday asked to call at office in plymouth on way hither stammered richard thought better be in first instance that must hear from how matter stood mr weasel took copious pinch of snuff shut eye a though be going to sneeze whenever client got upon embarrassing topic mr weasel took snuff to obviate necessity of looking in face while in case of compromising disclosure mr weasel sneezed to obviate hearing in case of kind mr yorke not moment be to be lost must advise mother going direct to gethin from house making sure of young lady evidence there be even possibility say be probable there be just chance see that may be subpoenaed by other side just so assented richard so naively that smile flitted across little lawyer face under circumstance then be what will do dear young sir mr yorke will go to gethin castle a guest a will venture to suggest under name will then find opportunity of speaking to miss trevethick without awakening father suspicion when come to cross key will have good news to bring something to talk about although must be very careful guarded mind that for will not be left alone together a be besides mere regret lamentation see see richard saw exceedingly well felt more grateful to lawyer for devising such arrangement than must like to have confessed nevertheless did thank heartily not at not at dear young sir drawing on one of glove in signal of departure in case like must consult feeling a well a array fact must bring heart head to bear together speaking of head reminds by by of subject of counsel propose to instruct mr smoothbore who lead upon circuit gather from letter that there will be difficulty with respect to fund may be necessary mr weasel for defense will be may rest assured forthcoming mother smile disappeared from lawyer face with electrical rapidity pardon young friend said a professional man only deal with principal in matter word forthcoming be little vague counsel be paid beforehand must remember must not be angry with mr weasel who be really good sort of man after kind be naturally cautious if have be most trustful of mankind experience must have taught prudence did like to see money down really a to mr yorke knew of pecuniary position be with relation to blank check history of be not of nature to inspire confidence be about to observe said richard haughtily that mother must satisfy claim in mean time there be over hundred pound in note gold be found upon when be searched at plymouth if doubt have only to make inquiry dear young sir returned lawyer earnestly be not courteous be not kind never doubted from first moment saw one with knowledge of mankind must do so professional etiquette compelled to remark must treat with principal only be let see added consulting note book have thing more to say yes yes with respect to young lady miss harry trevethick did not like to interrupt at time see have made memorandum be pretty be very very beautiful said richard earnestly remembrance of beauty giving tenderness to tone be capital nodded lawyer old bantam be judge session like pretty face so do for matter of hope be young good looking too smoothbore will make something of that may depend upon 'gracious heaven be iron arm of law to sunder happy lover for mere indiscretion make bright young life blank forever will give something like sir in voice broken by emotion bring off with flying color care about color if only brings off said richard grimly very natural remark dear young sir for one in present situation three week hence a hope believe will not be so easily satisfied more have more want know except in matter of time have very little to spare of just now must therefore take leave mr weasel have put on other glove hat with cheerful nod have actually placed finger on door handle when suddenly turned round said by by have almost forgotten little form of word in case be sure will be form yet like to omit never leave client in position without asking question so must excuse young friend not be offended be not in position to be very sensitive about what be said to answered richard bitterly pray ask please mr weasel looked cautiously round to see that warder be not too near lowered voice to whisper be little affair first dear young sir mean added have ever be in trouble with law before certainly not replied richard smiling have anticipated answer said little lawyer gayly thought right to make quite certain because if affair must happen to reach stage where question of 'character ' be mooted though wo get so far a trust in case one doe like to be taken altogether by surprise do see have be landscape painter say most innocent charming occupation be sure one smoothbore will make very most of case altogether will afford such opportunity that really ought to do cheap have never be thing else have never have other calling obtained livelihood by other than quite legal permissible mean eh what what have not be quite frank candid with dear sir fear be really not of much consequence said richard hesitating must allow to be judge of mr yorke said other gravely taking off hat once more one of glove imagine good catholic if please with father weasel for priest confession lasted for minute think will admit that what have told have not much bearing upon matter in hand said richard when have finished none at none at be hope not answered other thoughtfully what interesting revelation be what nice point a to whether matter be offense against law not how prettily smoothbore must treat subject if chanced to come in way looked at richard with admiration be most remarkable young man sir wish that circumstance permitted of shaking by hand good morning dear sir may depend upon not permitting grass to grow under foot when mother come will have good news for good morning warder took possession of richard while mr weasel followed by young man longing eye be ushered to opposite door on other side of be liberty lawyer mind be still within prison wall though leg be free walking up street of little town toward inn now be really most remarkable young man murmured to most ingenious young fellow upon word idea of having invented new crime why bless heart be quite epoch quite epoch chapter xxviii

passage only echoed to tread of warder spirit sank even lower than have be before alone in comfortless cell went over lawyer talk anew be strange how spark of comfort died out of be clear that in first instance companion have taken gloomy view of case that looked upon richard own story with utter disbelief be convinced must not hold water before jury remark about money having be recovered must have have reference to possible mitigation of sentence therefore took conviction for granted upon reconsideration of case with calmness calm of loneliness despair be richard admitted other conclusion to be arrived at by stranger who be acquainted with rash impulsive character reckless way must understand that have serious intention of robbing trevethick except be of daughter even trevethick must be aware of though with same exception before eye be more than doubtful whether must acknowledge smarting with sense of deceit richard have practiced almost with success upon might conceal real impression of affair treat a common felony taking brutality of solomon manner to when be arrested a index of prosecutor purpose felt that be what must happen if so what chance must have against such evidence must judge jury be persuaded to believe that have acted with romantic folly have in reality possessed if not to what protracted wretchedness might not be doomed old hope in short lay dead

thereby lose pregnant sentence honest men did not know mr smoothbore thought for first five minute that must sit listen to forever before have done with began to think that must have to do far be from to emulate prolixity with learned counsel set forth case must be conceded that did not hang over word ran a smoothly a oil with perfect distinctness if body missed meaning be not for want of being sufficiently expressed to listener of average ability however became insupportable by repetition be unhappily not exclusively vice of pulpit will take care to avoid error will be sufficient to say that when have finished richard stood accused not only of having stolen two thousand pound from john trevethick of having compassed that crime under circumstance of peculiar baseness have taken advantage of superior education manner appearance to impose upon honest cornishman a legitimate son of landlord secured within humble home footing of familiarity only better to compass scheme of villainy must have occurred to at very early period of acquaintance indeed mr smoothbore hinted that prisoner profession of landscape painting be mere pretense pretext that be more than probable that having heard by mean of trevethick hoard have come down to gethin with express intention of becoming possessed of accidental discovery of secret of letter padlock enabled to do in short by artful innuendo at that part of story richard be painted a common thief whose possession of such faculty a dexterity finesse only made more dangerous enemy of society there have be rumor mr smoothbore admitted of certain romantic circumstance connected with case be instructed to say that be wholly baseless that matter jury must have to decide upon be simply impudent audacious robbery committed in manner that might stigmatize a being quite exceptionally void of extenuation speech for prosecution immensely disappointed general public already half convinced in spite of by mr smoothbore impassioned clearness straightforward simplicity while pleased jury who be glad to hear that matter in hand be after ordinary one must necessitate deprivation of victual absence of fire candle witness for prosecution appeared a usual in order in inverse ratio to interest importance of respective testimony clerk of miner bank into whose hand note have be paid policeman mr dodge others who only repeated what already know even appearance of solomon coe be marked by nothing especial save to eye of accused in triumphant bearing of witness in malignant glance have shot toward ere began tale richard read that charge against be to be pushed to bitter end be in man power more than in other save one to extenuate to set down in malice there be doubt in rival mind though rancor took so blunt form that might well have be mistaken by others for outspoken candor of two course solomon have chosen showed scruple hesitation word be distinct decisive on one occasion though repetition of be forbidden by judge even accompanied by blow with sledge hammer fist in way of corroboration seemed that story have to tell be after very plain one when john trevethick who be last witness examined for prosecution strode into box feeling be intensified giant frame massive feature seemed somehow to associate with plain story evidence be a much in consonance with counsel speech a evidence must be with pleading when have quite done with unvarnished tale when mr smoothbore have given parting nod in sign that have done with sergeant balais rose for first time with uplifted finger a though for signal of delay honest landlord must have fled incontinently hanged like juda have daughter believe mr trevethick sergeant looked at jury with elevated eyebrow a though must have said if can get even admission out of hoary miscreant may consider fortunate indeed john trevethick did hesitate for one instant replied have not even looked at prisoner before at question gave involuntary glance toward met richard answering look when two men be fighting with hand upon throat of other not for dear life for longed for death of foe be possible that in face such inextinguishable lurid fire of hatred may be seen burning a then flashed from witness box to dock from dock to witness box scarcely under other circumstance must such look of deadly malice be exchanged between man man passed however in instant like electric fire be gone leaving trace behind have daughter replied trevethick a spoke face though somewhat pale became a blank hard meaningless a wall of stone man be about to perjure thought experienced mr balais looked around with air of one who be convinced of fact prisoner at bar be believe daughter lover be not not that knew of not that know of repeated mr balais will venture to repeat that witness said knew interposed judge demurely ordered sky light to be closed draught from inconvenienced body looked at officer of court who pulled string shut sky light a though have be most ingenious contrivance known to man not that be relief to to do so from inexplicable motive prompt to observe trivial circumstance with have nothing to do on occasion of engrossing interest even richard regarded little process of ventilation with considerable concern wondered whether judge must feel better after oh did know of attachment between prisoner daughter at time be going on under roof knew of afterward did read of in paper suppose eh heard of after robbery be discovered from daughter upon oath did not know of before then did not suspect even perhaps even suspect balais smiled shrugged shoulder principle of oratory be demosthenean motto be action action action friend on circuit called balais of action have have experience of depravity of human nature said shrug beat thing must be really amusing for atrocious infamy good heaven then never have conversation with prisoner with reference to daughter at never mr balais bent down interchanged word two with mr weasel behind now be so good a to give best attention mr trevethick for upon next question more may depend than may be aware of if have regard for own interest will answer truly for a sure a be necessary brother balais interrupted judge scratching forehead with forefinger looking up at sky light a though matter be not satisfactorily settled even yet lud be instructed that nothing le than conspiracy have be entered into against unfortunate client judge nodded slightly shivered considerably made mental note to complain of infernal draught before must dismiss grand jury ask mr trevethick continued counsel solemnly whether not in conversation held with prisoner upon certain day last month mentioned two thousand pound a sum must need see in possession before must listen to proposition of with respect to daughter hand did not never spoke of particular sum to at never at be mr balais who looked up at sky light time a though expected thunder bolt note of have heard so much a being hoarded in ingenious box of yours that be very ingenious man mr trevethick there be doubt box say be kept in certain cupboard be not be now please to look at jury when answer question where be particular cupboard situated mr trevethick into landlord impassive face there stole for first time look of disquiet harsh monotonous voice grew tremulous a replied cupboard be in daughter bedroom will do mr trevethick for present observed mr balais with emphasis though will probably have opportunity of seeing time glanced significantly toward dock in place chapter xxx for defense when mr balais rose again be to speak for defense addressed jury amidst unbroken silence so rapt indeed be attention of audience that smack of carter whip a went by in street below be resented by many frown a impertinent intrusion even quarter of church clock be listened to with impatience lest iron tongue must drown single sentence latter interruption did not however often take place for mr balais be a brief in speech a be energetic in action began by at once allowing main fact prosecution have proved that note have be taken from trevethick box found in prisoner possession who have be detected in very act of endeavoring to change for note of banking company what maintained be that exchange be not a mr smoothbore have suggested effected for purpose of realizing money simply of throwing dust in prosecutor eye have changed note only with intention of returning own money to trevethick under form even so young man one so thoroughly ignorant of way of world of business matter a be client must surely have be aware if using money for have be object that must be traced in note of mining company a easily a in note of bank of england nay by very proceeding of have even given double chance of being traced mr balais be not there of course to justify conduct of prisoner at bar be unjustifiable be reprehensible in very high degree what did maintain be that even taking for granted have be put in evidence young man conduct be not criminal be not that of thief have never have least intention of stealing money scheme have be merely stratagem to obtain object of affection for wife trevethick be hard grasping man be necessary for young fellow to satisfy that be possessed of certain property before must listen to proposition for daughter hand idea wrong foolish one indeed then look at youth inexperience be to impose upon old miser by showing own money in form then when have gained object to return to mr balais be for own part a certain of such being fact a that be standing in court house let turn eye on unhappy prisoner in dock judge for whether looked like mere felon learned friend have painted romantic self deceiving thoughtless lad such a mr balais felt convinced be have heard of proverb that thing be fair in love a in war when jury have be young perhaps of have acted upon theory at event be not unnatural idea for young people to act upon proverb have always certain weight authority of own be not necessarily holy writ mr balais be not quite certain whether proverb in question be one of solomon own not so put in cautious manner smacked of richard yorke perhaps have thought great harm to win love by false representation of state of finance must not see way how otherwise to melt stony heart of old curmudgeon who have doubtless notwithstanding evidence have heard from day encouraged young man address so long a believed to be mr carew lawful heir whole question in fact resolved into one of motive if there be not word of evidence forthcoming upon prisoner part mr balais must have left case in jury hand with confident conviction that must never impute to unhappy boy who have already suffered such torture of mind body a be more than sufficient punishment for offense deliberate shameful crime of stood accused have lost position in world already have lost sweetheart for have heard that day that be about to be driven into wedlock with rival man twice age hers have lost protection of father own flesh blood for since miserable occurrence have chosen to disown yet here be prosecutor who have lost nothing except own self respect respect of who have listened to audacious testimony that morning pressing for conviction for more punishment in word for gratification of mean revenge if mr balais have nothing more therefore to urge in client defense must have be content to leave jury to deal with case englishman who detested oppression loved that justice only be tempered with mercy a so happened there be need thus to leave necessity to appeal to mercy at have only to ask for barest justice be happily in position to prove that prisoner at bar have more stolen two thousand pound than own upright sagacious foreman sigh of relief be uttered from hundred gentle breast be coming to something at last seemed to say hundred fair face looked at mr balais who be growing gray wrinkled found new performance of pantomime harder harder a though must have kissed nevertheless yes gentleman of jury that money be given to by prosecutor daughter with own hand murmur of satisfaction ran round court house there be romance love story in case then after mr balais concluded most energetic speech with peroration of great brilliancy in richard harry be exhibited like transparency in bright color of youth hope passion finally sat down amidst what must have be burst of applause for harsh voice of usher nipping in bud by proclaiming silence there be need for doing that when mr balais jumped up to foot again a though be on spring called for harry trevethick judge be taking snuff at time such be stillness that must hear overplus falling on paper before on wrote down note there be minute delay during eye be fixed upon witness box then harry appeared be very pale wore look of anxious timidity bright spot came into cheek a turned face to prisoner in dock smiled upon from moment richard felt that be safe guarded a be still in peril forgot danger once more resolved that must cleave to tender creature to whom be about to owe safety to life end harry be simply yet attractively attired in pale violet silk dress with straw bonnet trimmed with same modest color be observed with reference to to innocence gentleness of expression that looked like dove dove seemed to richard bringing signal that flood be abating deep water of have so nearly overwhelmed soul body even judge a mr weasel have foretold regarded through double glass with critical approval for most excellent judge be of female attraction mr balais smiled triumphantly at jury did not tell seemed to say that client be guiltless in matter here be truth come to witness in favor bless richard feverish eye be fixed upon knew god here be spring in wilderness shadow of great rock in weary land a for looked only at judge expecting poor little ignoramus that be who must question be daughter of john trevethick of gethin said mr balais interrogatory simple a be made color rise coming from unexpected quarter yes sir keep inn doe not here mr balais affected to consult brief to give time to recover from modest confusion gethin castle believe yes sir prisoner at bar have be staying there for month have not stole look at richard spoke a plainly a look must speak oh yes be how came to know love only murmured yes sir speak up miss trevethick said counsel encouragingly twelve gentleman be very anxious to hear what have to say judge nodded smiled a though in corroboration a well a to add upon own account that must give also much pleasure to hear be prisoner staying in inn a ordinary guest did mix with family be in bar parlor most night sir along with father solomon be in bar parlor most night repeated mr balais significantly for be anxious that jury must catch that answer 'with father solomon ' who introduced into parlor father brought first sir on second day after came to gethin father brought in did now be rather unusual thing for landlord of inn to do be not to introduce young man whom have known twenty four hour to family circle to society of daughter eh please sir know sir of course miss trevethick how must think jury know have idea then why father introduced young gentleman to so early father said be friend of mr carew of crompton who be father landlord just so said mr balais with significant glance at attentive twelve mr trevethick have already discovered that youth be of good social position likely to prove excellent match 'will walk into parlor ' said spider to fly have prettiest daughter ever did spy ' body tittered at except mr smoothbore solicitor even judge blew nose now not only did prisoner at bar spend most night in bar parlor a be given to understand spent most day there at event in society did not father solomon be away most day sir so be left good deal together just so father took care to be away most day did in order that must be left good deal together mr smoothbore started to foot lud submit etc meaning that be mode of interrogating witness that must not submit to for instant very good said mr balais smiling will not put question in form then form be of very little consequence be left together however consequence be that two young people fell in love with one eh harry be crimson there stuck be very sorry to embarrass dear young lady be necessitated to press question did fall in love with one not answer harry be thinking of solomon to whom be to be married within ten day hung head come did fall in love with then there be ample apology for be sure ought to have be ashamed of if have now did 'court ' think must know what mean answer eye be upon judge double glass included might have be burning glass felt so hot frightened come did young gentleman ever give kiss yes sir murmured poor harry almost under breath did say 'yes ' inquired judge dipping pen in ink said lord said unhappy harry there be more kiss than one now dare say said mr balais with wink at jury be not on one side eh answer of be on other side be not mean on other cheek for have doubt be perfectly indifferent a to again there be little titter be own witness brother balais observed lordship seems to be giving unnecessary pain have very tender heart have old judge where young pretty woman be concerned otherwise be tartar lud be absolutely necessary to prove that client passion be reciprocated did ever return one of many kiss miss trevethick yes sir did ever meet alone at night in place believe called fairy bower yes sir yes repeated mr balais recapitulating fact upon finger be left alone with day met alone at night away from father roof returned kiss without slightest suspicion if be to believe evidence being aroused upon part of parent now miss trevethick be aware that father kept large sum of money two thousand pound in strong box be not be sir did ever speak to prisoner at bar about think yes did sir on one occasion here harry voice fluttered faltered one noticed however except prisoner if neighbor eye have watched narrowly be fixed upon witness must have seen face whiten brow grow damp why must have laid that stress upon on one occasion told that two thousand pound be in box in cupboard in bedroom did sir fastening of box be not ordinary lock believe be what be called letter padlock yes sir did ever open sir great bell seemed to be suddenly set tolling in richard brain be knell of hope have never opened at time eh continued mr balais cheerfully learned secret afterward yes did do remember letter did open yes sir what be b n z very good have heard from counsel for prosecution that be so that mr trevethick kept memorandum of on piece of paper fitted into watch case did always carry that watch about with not always when went out to market be likely to be late sometimes left at home in own room suppose where body else must get at suppose so sir suppose know did do not did not open watch case so discover mean of unlocking box sir said harry faintly once more turned eye to richard be true tender glance one must have said accompanied by attempt at smile of encouragement if have be glance of gorgon must not have have more appalling effect literally seemed to turn into stone illustration come did young gentleman ever give kiss recollect miss trevethick said mr balais earnestly be getting confused fear now please to give attention say that knew that letter b n z be formed key of letter padlock yet that did not open father watch case how then did become possessed of secret answer harry caught breath convulsively turned deadly pale must never tell how mr yorke have endeavored to suborn well well be matter of very little consequence though see learned friend be making copious note of said mr balais gayly main point be what a have told did occur that found out secret somehow when got suppose opened box answer save from mr smoothbore who observed tartly have right to assume sergeant let young woman have glass of water suggested kindly judge lord lord cried harry with sudden passion be not guilty richard did not mean to steal money indeed did not only wished to get possession of that father might believe to be man of wealth did endeavor to compose young woman interposed judge learned counsel will only ask what be necessary take time miss trevethick take time pursued mr balais in blandest tone question be how prisoner became possessed of money now tell did not give with own hand bell be still tolling in richard brain yet must hear buzzing of fly against window of court house careless whistle of lad in street without be same tune that keeper at crompton have be wont to whistle in leisure moment at home mind reverted with flash to glade of stately park herd of deer high mossed gate have shut in face of hound when be chasing carew carriage be bang of gate have harry really answered in firm voice resounded through silent court house sir what said mr balais raising voice little do mean to say then recollect that fate of prisoner at bar may depend upon reply to question richard yorke did not become possessed of note by connivance through mean at sir answered harry passionately ca say that indeed sir can not be innocent richard be innocent never meant to steal o god help in excitement not because wished to do so have turned about once more caught sight of prisoner at bar be turn now to shrink appalled petrified be not reproach that saw pictured in well loved face downright hate loathing will never never forgive cried with piteous wail then scream followed scream be borne out in haste doctor sent for cross examination be of course quite out of question indeed mr smoothbore be much too sagacious man to wish to exercise privilege failure of witness for defense have proved case of prosecution be mr smoothbore who must now best afford to praise innocence candor of unhappy harry be not evident that tender creature have be tampered with almost persuaded to perjure for sake of prisoner at bar almost happily for end of justice not quite persuaded natural love of right have conquered ignoble passion with have be inspired by unscrupulous man what word must sufficiently paint baseness of conduct of accused be not clear that have endeavored to escape scot free at sacrifice of poor girl good name forsooth be to proclaim thief to save worthless self be not for mr smoothbore heaven forbid to exaggerate such wickedness be possible that phrase young in year old in vice have ever have more appropriate application than in present case for credit of human nature trusted not point upon learned friend have mainly relied having be thus proved wholly untenable fact of richard taking money having be incontestably brought home to only remained for mr smoothbore to notice what have be said with respect to motive if prisoner at bar have even have intention have be so gratuitously imputed to of returning money to prosecutor when once object of supposed scheme have be effected must be no le guilty of crime be laid to charge be possible indeed in such case there might be extenuating circumstance must not affect verdict of jury however might influence lordship sentence after verdict have be truly given must say after what have just occurred in court after painful scene have just witnessed breaking down of innocent girl in act of self sacrifice culpable in infinitely more culpable in who have incited to do for must not for instant suppose that prisoner legal adviser must have suggested line of defense taking into consideration mr smoothbore must confidently ask jury whether prisoner at bar be to be credited with merely romantic stratagem with crime heinousness of be only exceeded by mean by have striven to exculpate from to evade end of justice when mr smoothbore have thus concluded lengthened impassioned harangue sat down wiping hand upon handkerchief a though implying that have washed of prisoner for good that very dirty job have be while judge rose left court being hour appointed to system by nature for reception of lunch

waiting doom be hoped must be severe one spectator be pitiless have turned thumb toward breast a to verdict there be doubt who knew character of judge opined that young gentleman must get hot notwithstanding that be first offense odds be taken that must have fourteen year at event said one of small official in answer to eager inquiry more than must do on head with enigmatical reply of oracle astonished questioner be compelled to be content silence in court si lence judge have returned be thought by that be in prisoner favor that judge have lunched be mistaken perhaps fatal economy have provided african sherry charge be scarcely le dead against prisoner than have be mr smoothbore closing speech a for motive upon such stress have be laid by counsel for defense might be plea for recommendation to mercy if jury believed must not affect question of prisoner guilt that stolen property have be found in possession of accused there be sort of doubt if prisoner at bar have not taken out of prosecutor strong box who have such be form in case be left for jury be up whispered mr weasel behind hand to mr balais mr balais nodded indifferently case be over so far a be concerned be not going to employ significant action gratuitously must have be waste of power indeed at age jury did not leave box laid head together like hydra deliberated for minute be to say foreman whispered can return one verdict must say gentleman eleven answered one find prisoner guilty lordship lordship nodded approval in opinion gentleman must not have done otherwise hem then that common phrase must have

upon physical appearance be sometimes such a must have seemed to have disqualified appeared incredible that must have passed preliminary medical examination one be hump backed almost blind be

for visitor presently while be yet below stair arrived charles agnes effected indeed diversion enough also great disturbance alteration for worse in mr coe temper no sooner a seemed to have back be turned then than intimacy between girl son have strictly forbidden have be recommenced with connivance encouragement of wife too else how must lad dare thus to bring home for first time solomon be openly rude to agnes latter being girl of spirit resented by quietly rising to depart charley rash impetuous rose to accompany solomon stormed displeasure seemed that presence of visitor must have be wholly inadequate to prevent family scene when agnes interposed with dignity charles must rather go alone if father object to presence here will not be intruded if considers company condescension can not accept upon such term charles must have taken arm in defiance of consequence led off under solomon nose opposition on part offended be almost a angry with for thwarting a be with father be triangular duel combatant in be narrowly watched by disregarded stranger when agnes got way departed be girl of character observed with cynical smile be girl without penny answered solomon gloomily with scowl at son upon whom young fool wish to throw away what so early observed mr balfour good humoredly addressing charles when be age thought of enjoying life not of marriage wonder however that girl must strive to enslave so handsome young fellow a son sir be quite natural there be need to blame far le ashamed perhaps of having exhibited such violence of temper before guest solomon be very willing to be mollified grimly smiled approval of sentiment charles too though fully resolved to set right with agnes on morrow be not displeased with visitor remark two woman justly resented a impertinent freedom if charles thought have not be so preoccupied with own wrong deprivation of agnes society have promised for rest of day snub conceived have administered to must have noticed too for be by mean wanting in observation that new comer manner to hostess mr basil be not what must have be be not absolutely rude be studiously careless of presence no longer stared at a at first on contrary seemed to ignore fact of existence never addressed if spoke to replied a briefly a possible then turned at once to solomon son mr basil concluded that be vulgar fellow who having penetration enough to discover that male have upper hand in establishment did not give trouble to conciliate le important member of harry always timid suspicious be alarmed at air have in eye something hostile in a well a contemptuous must not understand therefore mistrusted influence have evidently obtained over husband already have superseded that of mr basil that solomon must no longer take pain to make agreeable to latter now that have obtained from object be to one who knew character explicable enough why must stranger have taken place a counselor friend idea of personal advantage be of course at bottom of be clear not only to sage mr basil even to harry since even moderately skillful looker on see more of game than best player that in contest of wit solomon must have small chance with new friend opinion of mr basil be that new speculation in manner connected with crompton sale have be entered into by two men mr balfour must in end secure oyster while mr coe be left with shell harry have darker foreboding still be instinctively confident that there be enmity at work in new comer a well a readiness common to speculator to overreach friend there be look in pallid face when glanced a thought unheeded on charles solomon to mind boded ill if did so be certainly unsuspected by on whom fell mr coe have apparently never found companion so agreeable to curiously enough idea seemed to be shared by charles according to own account mr balfour have be abroad in western america for many year have there retrieved fortune originally inherited have be speedily dissipated in pleasure of town long absence from such scene have by mean dulled taste for conversation ran on little else have light rattling way with to harry view resembled youthful spirit no more than galvanism in corpse resembles life be certainly not in harmony with age appearance very graphic power of description expressed curious about change in public amusement since left town near twenty year ago seriously placed under charles guidance on expedition of pleasure for latter be always ready to strangely enough solomon made objection notwithstanding that own purse string have to be drawn pretty wide to supply extravagance new friend have only to suggest that must give lad five pound note to enjoy with thing be done at once a for mr balfour seemed to be made of money so freely did spend if did not offer use of purse to young companion be only a told because feared to offend pride besides said when be alone together on one of expedition of amusement from solomon whose notion of enjoyment be mainly confined to money making always excused upon pretense of having business to do be only right father must be made to fork out be a rich a croesus be quite unreasonable that must stint in enjoyment when one day will have pleasure of life to pick choose from must have tested solomon new born friendship severely if must have heard mr balfour dilate upon topic did with such earnestness fervor that lad be soon convinced of great expectation cautious reticence of parent have so long concealed from on other hand charley companion deduced argument from fair prospect be not so welcome to lad maintained that under circumstance must be madness to risk father displeasure by uniting irretrievably to agnes to other young woman good office will be always at disposal lad urged gravely deny at present have considerable influence with mr coe must not be proof against so flagrant act of disobedience a contemplate great bulk of property be at own disposal nature if may speak plainly to in so important matter be obstinate implacable at event there be hurry since charming young lady be boy girl at present life be uncertain may be own master day wait till be so wait for little at event to

fulfilled plunged in dissipation young man thought le le of love gave little trouble though still avowed unalterable attachment to set right with grew more more dissatisfied with own home at same time that of agnes became le le attractive in short drifted away daily farther farther from safe mooring of love duty harry perceived with dread so deep that even drove to invoke husband aid against man who inexplicable a hostility might be be bent firmly believed upon ruin of darling boy with solomon a well knew fact of son dissipation be not likely to move to interfere saw that companionship of balfour be gradually producing estrangement between charles portionless artist daughter so far cordially approved of cared to question by what mean new friend made agreeable have argument available except of expense to astonishment dismay failed to affect prudent spouse just let thing be while be solomon reply mind own business be quite true lad throwing money in gutter at fine rate in end will get back again more with balfour take for foolish doting father will pay for before have done with throw sprat to catch whale other fool will interfere with fishing harry dared not say more husband have be in worst of humor ever since have returned from crompton be more brutal tyrannical to that have to be civil conciliatory to new friend involuntarily indulgent upon account to charles unhappy mother be powerless to check evil growth of be so patent to loving instinct there be none to whom must look for help mr basil have longer influence with solomon besides be seriously ill have now be confined to own room for week in extremity harry have even resolved to make personal appeal to man balfour to ask in what husband have injured to adjure to forgive wrong at least not to visit upon charley innocent head shrank with inexplicable terror from putting design into effect felt must humiliate to purpose must deny in cold cynical way that entertained thing friendship for astute husband affection for bright impulsive son besides to say truth be afraid to speak with man have suspicion that weird shadowy fear be in degree shared by mr basil at time even imagined that be not so much indisposition a desire to avoid presence caused landlady to absent from family circle mr coe at event entertained such prejudice against guest day by day grew more communicative with more solicitous to hear opinion with seldom failed to agree two men be in reality a be easy to see a opposite in character a pole mr balfour be apparently always have be man of pleasure have seen men city remark be shrewd selfish worldly wise enough be rarely that talk ever strayed to matter of business so solomon be perforce listener that unambitious part played to admiration upon one occasion however after dinner converse happened to turn upon partnership solomon urged great convenience how one man brought money other brain how pleasant must be for former to live at ease while latter gathered honey for for present use for wintry store rose with familiar subject to quite flight of poetry mr balfour with shut eve mocking smile dilated upon sentiment involved in such community of enterprise sympathy engendered by happy social effect be produced by host did not must not perceive that remark be ironical pursued subject to detail proportion of profit balance sheet etc until charles rose with yawn left two elder together well balfour said solomon frankly a soon a be alone talk reminds of matter first introduced to one purchase of outlying bit of crompton property wheal dane illustration will give thousand pound for crompton lot ay replied other carelessly lighting cigar be quite wonderful to see how many cigar mr balfour got through daily might have almost thought that have be denied

yet know why must have be so sweet upon be only bare bit of ground with round hole in close by sea be said solomon puffing at clay pipe what on earth must have made buy well told once lost yacht off turlock when coming to england last autumn very nearly life with when one escape with whole skin from such storm a wrecked there first piece of dry land one come to seems very attractive happened to be cast ashore beneath that very spot so took fancy to if have be good papist must have built chapel there to patron saint in gratitude for preservation a be resolved to erect villa for there will have excellent view situation be healthy if seek for other reason for purchase have none to give be whim if like then can afford to indulge whim one cost good deal however gave five hundred pound for

perhaps must have got cheaper not if have be bidding against observed host significantly say so be never shipwrecked thereabouts be oh remember be brought up in neighborhood have tender recollection of spot perhaps with relation to madame up stair what creature of sentiment men of business sometimes be dear did live near spot said solomon slowly though must deceive if pretended that have thing to do with wish to posse must not deceive good friend answered balfour coolly a be about to say must not be frank let be frank open above thing wish to be so assure be solomon meek reply when offered

until hear stick to plot lot acreage tell whole story without reservation attempt to deceive on slightest point then will have way will divide land of gold between a seems to much more likely browse like twin donkey on crop of thistle have nothing bare word to trust to said solomon doubtfully still must risk come be bargain then here hand upon never mind hand good friend returned other coolly in

comprised in once worked by roman disused since time there be many such in cornwall so have heard said balfour while other sipped glass be curious to contrast grave earnest manner of host with careless uninterested air of guest who presently a narrative proceeded leaned face upon hand gazed into fire occasional glance sideways at companion through finger alone testifying that attention be still preserved never stirred limb winked eyelid when solomon came out with great secret mine be said to be worked out mr balfour have purchased by mere accident a being in same lot with proposed building ground will have reason to believe turn out gold mine say so did not know that there be gold in cornwall there be a good at least there be metal that bring gold tin copper wheal dane be full

trevethick a good judge a man on earth under saw told of existence on death bed when did die how be lingering painful death be struck down suddenly interposed balfour ask added hastily for solomon looked up in wonder at companion vehemence because credibility of such story a tell must depend upon state of man brain did die painful lingering death wit be clear enough answered solomon be ten year ago more mind a well a though be yesterday indeed have thought of little else since 'the best legacy have to leave sol lie in last word of mine ' said beo do listen lay to heart ' then told how a boy have once explored wheal dane in play with other boy found copper lode in certain spot be not so young even then that knew value of such find have held tongue though visited place pretty often for

a usual find departure relief since balfour remained behind last instruction from husband be to treat unwelcome guest with marked consideration to let have way in thing also hinted though be scarcely necessary to insure obedience at certain brilliant prospect be about to present through balfour mean if be only kept in good humor harry must have much preferred to relinquish favor at price of absence not so son notwithstanding disparity in age new acquaintance be already fast friend latter have laid out to please lad have succeeded partly perhaps from very novelty of companionship for charley knew one in town be tired of taking pleasure therein alone chiefly through store of agreeable anecdote illustrative of enjoyment wealth conferred with balfour tickled ear in few year perhaps sooner who know thing of speak will be within own mean will be rich who be so can please in almost thing can then marry agnes if will without fear of being disinherited what be better more likely may choose from score of agneses even take have light amusing way with balfour hid cynicism must otherwise have jarred upon young companion for charles though selfish fond of pleasure be good natured have not reached that period of life when sherry must need not only be dry have bitter in be genuinely fond of mother yet even in short time balfour a well knew have taught to disobey not setting at open defiance indeed regarding advice remonstrance with sort of tender contempt meant for good mentor admitted woman have not much knowledge of world if young man be not to be own master at eighteen must look to be in leading string life harry perceived darling plastic nature changing daily for worse in hand of crafty potter though be admission humiliating to a mother to make made to mr basil in sick room mr balfour be doing charley harm said be altered boy already yet husband talk a though be never to be rid of man what money what gain can ever compensate for demoralization of child nothing indeed said mr basil quietly have little patience be not gentleman going on friday yes will come back again be only business call into midlandshire doe not even take luggage away have great mind to tell point blank that presence in house at event in mr coe absence be unwelcome dare not do be afraid yes husband must be very angry without doubt said mr basil thoughtfully be not be afraid of man reminds of hateful creature what be in opera for mr aird gave ticket agnes went with to see mephistopheles what strange fancy be only sour pleasure jaded man if be not so ill must speak to be right not to do so that be husband place who have brought here let thing be a be till friday harry sighed perforce assented friday came mr balfour went a have designed not without stating at breakfast intention of returning on ensuing monday tuesday at latest even making engagement with charley to spend latter evening with at theatre do happen to know when husband will be home inquired harry timidly madam be good enough to say however that absence be to make difference a to remaining here a guest reply might easily have be made offensive be delivered with most studied courtesy cut hostess ground from under for have answered very objection have intended to imply felt not only defeated reproved let hope will both return together said think that very probable answered mr balfour slowly hour later have departed hostess under pretense of being engaged with sick friend up stair not having so much a shaken hand charles indignant at slight must have accompanied to railway station balfour must not hear of for have two reason in first place be anxious to keep route secret secondly be part of system to give young man sort of trouble inconvenience on account wished association that linked together to be one of pleasure mr basil a have said have not made appearance that morning below stair be in fact better rather worse that news from lingmoor outwardly borne so well have shaken to core still sooner have balfour left than made shift to rise even came down to dinner discussed with charley who have considerable regard for character of late guest not with hostility a mother be wont to do with air of one who asks for information have confidence in verdict seek lad flattered by implied compliment to sagacity answered question readily enough praised friend of course thought praised even when spoke ill of repeated pungent saying served up anecdote such of a be adapted at least for ear of lady anew by mean hoped to bring hearer to better opinion of so capital fellow in mr basil case apparently succeeded mother still reiterated opinion that mr balfour be dangerous personage not fit companion for young man charles smiled at for be almost literal fulfillment of prophecy balfour have made to believed in gentleman sagacity accordingly more than ever woman be so ludicrously prejudiced fact of mr basil white witch not being so be exception proved rule have be evidently interested in anecdote of one of have even requested to hear particular twice over not that in own judgment be best being of weird sort have probably struck fancy have lost in telling too for did not pretend to have gift of narrative a mr balfour have mother have seen in story in question nothing at mr basil came down stair more after evening grew worse worse be not only confined to room to bed harry be not much with seized with avidity opportunity of being alone with charley to undo a far a must mr balfour work with be not hard for boy be creature of impulse swayed for good ill with equal ease discovered that must be useless to attempt henceforth to conceal from nature of future prospect be now firmly convinced that be heir to large fortune regretted too late that have left disclosure to stranger what grieved much more with reason be that attempt now made to bring influence of agnes to hear upon proved unsuccessful girl resolutely refused to come to house in absence of master contrary a knew to express commandment charley too whose visit to mr aird studio have be intermitted for time be received in soho with coldness be not in harry nature to understand independence of spirit deeply deplored on son account have looked to young girl to be guardian angel have never anticipated that must possibly decline to watch over charge so precious must not allow even to herself that son own conduct be a much cause of a husband ill favor saw in clearly enough mark of cloven hoof work of balfour sick mr basil must give small comfort though did not attempt to defend late visitor a have so unwarrantably appeared to do when discussing with charley man be gone dear said wearily perhaps may never come back let not meet trouble way charley have kind good heart for white witch showed great favor to lad at time will come right at last seemed too ill weary to argue matter harry left a thought to repose sooner be gone however than closed lid of mr basil be opened wide revealed sleepless unutterable woe sharp pinched face showed pain fear parched lip muttered unceasingly word like be perhaps raving of fevered brain be sure of now quite sure stag stag there be room for hope heart have become stone power can soften be use to speak rather be like one in dream who watch murder done can not cry out chapter xlii mine at midnight mr balfour for so must call now since

caravansary with daily fly bill electric bell after dinner scarcely touched wandered out be habit to do so a told hostler who be also night chamberlain did not return till long after midnight observed a gave man crown for sitting up for to so late hour that moon looked very fine upon sea must be painter guess sir said hostler with grin of intelligence why asked balfour sharply what make think well sir returned man apologetically mean offense be always gentleman painter at least so say at gethin wish more of 'em came here a be so free with money so fond of moon lunatic eh said new arrival with loud quick laugh well be painter friend then took candle retired to room not to bed disarranged bed clothes rumpled pillow then walked softly to fro in slipper until morning on following day made

go through with in second level be perceptibly warmer dark noiseless object began to flit about torch once something soft struck against balfour foot then scampered away looked behind not trace of light be to be discerned while before be impenetrable gloom except for feeble gleam of companion lantern above roof be just discernible from long string of fungi white clammy hung down brushed against face a moved slowly forward come on said solomon impatiently whose spirit seemed to rise in familiar scene be only few score yard from golconda balfour stopped short thought said there be level there be strange look of disappointment in face even of rage yes yes here be cried other putting down ladder have carried from place to place be only depth that separate from dug well roman left off a will

sweat bedewed forehead must not murder man to dissolve partnership certainly not will leave to die be rat will have to settle together six month hence perhaps may have picnic here explore place then will find where be now standing well picked bone metal part of lantern will cause quite excitement will search further in northeast corner there will be found copper lode will take word for mr balfour be sure will not do pleaded wretched man be not in man nature to treat fellow creature with such barbarity be trying to frighten know own have succeeded know what be to be shut up in desolate dark place alone out of reach of succor even for eight forty hour so be terrible what must be then to suffer so for twenty year be third voice seemed to wake echo of lonesome cavern solomon looked up in terror beheld third face that of robert balfour transfigured held glowing brand above so that deep lined feature must be distinctly seen be instinct with deadly rage malice there be fire in eye might well have be taken for of madness solomon heart sank within a looked mr balfour said in coaxing voice come look at treasure sparkle in light of lantern like gold will have if please wish to share with so take for madman do look again look fixedly upon solomon coe recognize even yet wonder be not be dull be so changed by wrong misery own mother doe not know woman of whom robbed nineteen year ago yes

at inn have got to take ladder back to gethin cry of mingled rage despair burst forth from richard foe what have calculated upon absence of ladder producing suspicion be curious how great wit jump together that have also struck will take back for well know where ought to be be quite familiar with house at gethin a may remember perhaps may keep lantern will not be missed if will take advice will put out light to preserve candle a article of food put somewhere where rat can not eat may prolong torment day can also eat horn of lantern will doubtless preserve that for bonne bouche be not superstitious else must suggest that father in law spirit be exceedingly likely to haunt northeastern corner down yonder here there be dull scrambling noise violent struggle a of foot hand against wall then heavy thud now be very foolish of solomon to attempt to get out of place informed must never be escaped from without wing sincerely hope have not hurt much hear moving slowly about again so may leave without anxiety good by solomon richard waited moment frightful figure of hate triumph peering down into pit beneath where be now dark be too proud to speak to convict perhaps well well be natural in so honest man take leave then have message conclude for home inarticulate cry like of wild animal caught in snare be only reply be worst of letting candle go out mused richard aloud rat have got hold of already then with steady foot smiling face showed how previous fear have be assumed retraced step mounted to upper air sky be clearer now casting torch for have further need far into

must knit brow clench hand with apprehension that have found enemy be bringing to door not slightest fear of consequence to in case agitated mind have quite resolved what to do that prison wall must ever hem in again bare idea that solomon must escape vengeance drove to brink of frenzy must have left place at once that thought coincidence of departure with disappearance of foe might possibly awaken suspicion so staid on through day waiting for news knew must arrive sooner later at noon thought landlady wore unusually grave air felt impelled to ask be matter then if there be nothing if only looked sour a folk often did just because be sunday might think too curious from window little later saw knot of people in rain talking eagerly together one of pointing with hand toward gethin be

respected a prosperous owner of dunloppel mine have yielded so largely for so many year must certainly not have be pressed by pecuniary embarrassment therefore idea of suicide be out of question

not to return to london for at least ten day mr coe son must without doubt be telegraphed for must not repair to house in absence idea of being under same roof alone with mother be now repugnant to

life portrait faded from mind like dissolving view in place stood that of solomon coe haggard emaciated hideous still le must think of harry son between whom spectre of unhappy man rose up at once summoned by thought of a by spell did not occur to richard even now that have have no right to kill shuddered to think if have really done so how late opening flower of love have just discovered must blossom into fear loathing in case heart must have be softened only to be pierced mother death knowledge of harry fidelity of existence of son to whom affection have be already drawn unknowingly in

faster faster be still cry though horse galloped whenever be practicable wheel cast winter mire into eager face haste be made a well knew upon road to own ruin to find solomon alive be to be accused of having compassed death there be hope in magnanimity of such foe yesterday richard have cared little nothing for own safety be only bent upon prosecution of scheme against foe now life have mysteriously become dear to be about to risk in saving man have hated most on earth from doom to have consigned have calculated possibility be in own favor have resolved into single chance that solomon might be induced by unconditional offer of wheal dane golden treasure to forego revenge greed be great malice a richard have good cause to know be also not easily satisfied moreover even if victim must decline to be prosecutor must still stand in great peril be only too probable that must be recognized at gethin for stranger have so lately be staying at turlock have not indeed mentioned assumed name at latter place lack of interest in fate of solomon whose disappearance have be narrated to by waitress departure from town under such circumstance must in case of identification be doubtless contrasted with post haste journey of to deliver same man have made up mind however to neglect precaution to avoid contingency must be dark when got to gethin purpose once accomplished might easily escape recognition unless must be denounced by solomon in case richard be fully determined that must glut more curiosity of crowd must never stand in prisoner dock be consigned again to stone gossip must have dead man face to gaze at welcome might make what sport pleased of not again of living agony then instead of being solomon murderer must be victim to judge by present feeling thought richard bitterly man must not enjoy triumph even then revenge a mother have once told be like game of battle door be never certain who get last stroke if solomon be now dead starved skeleton rat eaten corpse a might be richard felt that must still have have advantage over what be why be stopping cried frantically a man pulled up on top of hill let breathe horse for instant pleaded driver will gain

compliment upon workmanship truly there be such thing a forgetting to recall past to minutest detail at judgment day will not be so impracticable a of must desire richard have made up mind exactly a to what must say to man question suddenly presented have be absent from thought from moment that have resolved to rescue enemy be very simple one too must have occurred to one else a have done already many time to have mr coe be found yet listened for answer eagerly for if such be case not only be journey useless have brought into very jaw of destruction must have thrown away life for nothing sir

to horse though be looking for high low ca be found nowhere doe strike then that mr coe might have taken with lor sir cried inn keeper with admiration so must have ' done of course strike one when thing have be put into one head well 't be good lantern now 't be lost dear dear golden vision of succeeding to management of inn of taking to furniture fixing in gross have flitted across honest gentleman brain disappearance of lantern affected with acute sense of pecuniary damage general valuation must probably be no le because of absence of article send out borrow a many in fact a can get said richard impatiently get ready torch two besides pick out four of strongest men yonder bid come with search wheal dane what that old pit sir will not find man to do no not if knowed a master be at bottom of wait till morning master be at bottom of feel sure took lantern with to search mine will give pound apiece to start at once pack up food lend mattress to bring home upon be quick be quick richard energy fairly overpowered phlegmatic inn keeper whose conscience perhaps also smote with respect to missing master set about execution of order promptly wheal dane have truly hinted be very unpopular spot with neighbor after on other hand sovereign be rare in gethin greatly prized in le than hour necessary richard have indicated be procured party consisting of four stalwart miner inn keeper started for pit be followed by inhabitant of little village attracted by rumor of purpose have oozed out from bar of gethin castle windy down have probably never known so strange concourse a presently streamed over with torch lantern stood around mouth of disused mine night be dark nothing must be seen save what flare of light carried showed jagged rim of pit without bottom notwithstanding number there be little talk among have native dread of dismal place besides there might now be ghastly secret hidden within muffled exclamation half of admiration half of awe broke from circling crowd a ladder planted richard be seen descending torch in hand other man followed none have volunteered have asked for companion watched a countryman of who have formerly worked wheal

others that must hear stifled cry when le fortunate le imaginative must hear see nothing after little darkness silence reigned supreme beneath seemed standing on threshold of tomb chapter xlvii what be found in wheal dane full half hour to watcher above seemed much longer interval have elapsed since richard have disappeared in depth of wheal dane not sign of return have reached attentive throng thought 'd come to harm muttered fisherman to neighbor be sin shame to let venture ay may say returned other aloud call downright murder in a sent be not a sent observed inn keeper with honest indignation of man have not right habitually on own side what said to gentleman be 'wait till morning ' why must send here stopped though reason for not wishing to hurry matter must have be quite conclusive why be let to go down at being stranger resumed first speaker why did somebody show way because nobody knowed answered one of four miner whose service richard have retained who justly imagined that fisherman remark have be reflection on own profession 'd have ' gone down dunloppel with at midnight other mine a can be called such be different ay ay be so said second miner know more of place than fisherman there may be a much water in a in sea for aught can tell be belief be more afraid of dead hand than water observed voice from crowd great majority of be composed of fisher folk reply be given to perhaps because speaker old cripple thersites of village be beneath notice perhaps because remark be unanswerable miner be bold enough against material enemy be superstitious to man if solomon coe be alive continued same voice must have ' feared nothin ' be first word old man a ever heard speak in favor said miner contemptuously have waited for till be dead still must have ' gone durst observed old fellow cunningly be p'int allusion to dead hand to missing solomon be not of nature to inspire courage in to whom be already lacking silence again ensued there be le light for torch

of young fellow must fetch farmer gray in le than time come lad be off with ye suggestion be highly applauded except by miner who have so injudiciously compromised be carried out at once when ladder arrived three other miner ashamed of deserting comrade volunteered to descend with excitement among spectator be great indeed when four men disappeared in level of wheal dane a richard have done before light of combined torch lingered little in rear sound of voice a halloed to one to missing man be heard for several minute darkness silence swallowed up also watcher gazed on one aghast be not easy thing even for accustomed to underground labor to search unfamiliar spot by torch light fitful gleam make object on fall difficult of identification be doubtful whether one have seen that before not whether be not retracing old ground even to practiced eye object too be not so salient a tree stone mark locality above ground add to in present case that searcher be momently in expectation of coming upon something sought yet feared to find will be seen that progress be of necessity slow kept together too a close a sheep narrowed compass of research caused combined torch to distribute only a much light a one man must have done provided with chandelier knew however that predecessor have descended into second level so that did not need to explore first at ground be hard gave forth echo to cautious heavy tread cry of hollo be there reiterated like nervous child playing hide seek reverberated from roof to wall presently when stopped to listen for voice of rock to cease there be heard human moan seemed to come up from great depth out of darkness before listened earnestly sound be repeated faint cry of man in grievous pain there must be level observed miner who have volunteered search man have fallen down have therefore to go back for ladder pushing before end began presently to run freely then stopped have adjusted by side of shorter ladder richard have brought down with must not have fallen then observed miner answering comrade remark a be custom with class of great doer small talker at considerable interval yes must replied one who have first spoken see ladder be short may have pitched over stood listened peering down into darkness beneath there be repetition of cry wounded man have apparently spent last strength perhaps last breath in uttering must be down here somewhere come on situation be sufficiently appalling men have lost terror now that knew there be fellow creature needing help descended slowly who be foremost presently cried out see here be man

hardly have overlooked have not former monopolized attention lay richard grievously hurt rib be broken one of be pressed in upon lung still be alive men turned attention first to since solomon be beyond aid by help of two ladder side by side bore up wall of rock so from level to level tedious painful journey to wounded man to upper air be carried to inn upon mattress own care have provided for while four miner to amazement of throng once more descended into pit for still more ghastly burden richard must speak little though with pain by order messenger be dispatched that night to plymouth to telegraph news of discovery of husband body to mr coe next anxiety be to hear surgeon report not on own condition on of solomon gentleman did not arrive for hour richard be secretly well pleased at delay be hope for certain reason that must not arrive until body be stiff cold saw richard first of course case be very serious so much so that thought right to mention fact in order that patient might settle worldly affair if needed settlement there be immediate danger good sir be always well in such case to have mind free from anxiety understand be quite right said richard gravely moreover since opportunity may not occur again let now state how happened nay must not talk know at least enough of for present what do know asked richard with eye half shut with eager ear that in benevolent attempt to seek after mr coe met with same accident though trust will not have same ending a unfortunate gentleman pitched upon head broke neck while fell upon side be so murmured richard be partner see there there not word more insisted doctor deposition can wait having done what must for patient left in order to examine unfortunate solomon investigation corroborated that have already heard of circumstance of death with also richard evidence accorded observation made by one of miner who have found body to effect that be yet warm when have come upon excited surgeon ridicule be now tuesday

fancy be very proper word to apply to impression if take advice however will not repeat such piece of evidence when put upon oath for thing be simply impossible then suppose be in wrong said dick to jack on supposition acted in way too self reliant science whose mission be to explode fallacy occasionally assist in explosion suffocation of fact for solomon coe have not be dead hour when body be found when richard alone on errand of mercy be approaching brink of third level must hear solomon calling lustily for help nay be not only help murder that cried out notwithstanding menace that word implied toward richard hurried on well pleased to hear vigor of cry assured that enemy be not only living unhurt a light carried grew more distinct to indeed shout redoubled when came quite near disclosed feature of bearer there be dead silence two men stood confronting one one in light distinctly seen looking down upon other in shade just a have parted only eight forty hour ago to one of a

cruel foe come back to taunt to behold already way toward death to make slow approach more bitter great a be agony solomon held peace offered to monarch of fate tribute of groan be come to rescue said richard in low distinct tone to undo evil have already done although be le than deserved overpayment of debt owed in return will doubtless denounce a having meant to murder answer if richard have not heard cry must have seemed that poor wretch have lost power of speech huge head drooped upon shoulder leaned against rocky wall a though limb must not have otherwise supported shook indeed be with weakness with hate a though have palsy well will have reason to do so continued richard calmly for did mean to murder in ten minute hence will find among neighbor free to act a please will make appeal to mercy must know be a fruitless a be yours to mine other day if abstain from molesting mine with hidden treasure will be own have nothing more to say solomon answered nothing perhaps thought richard still doubt well here be ladder suited action to word solomon great hand flew out from side clutched rung a dog teeth close upon bone dog growl too half triumph half threat came from deep chest then began slowly to ascend keeping eye fixed on richard latter drew back little to give space watched with folded arm now said solomon stepping off ladder with prolonged have of one who breathes freely after long oppression be turn what be about to do asked richard calmly what think be quits richard yorke do at least that when have seen hung must seem so to know what be to die here slowly in dark be about to learn indeed yes complained other day of having used law against well will not have to reproach with second time be about to change place be will keep sentry down yonder till death come to

beast of prey swear to came here to rescue with other purpose said richard earnestly be not afraid of when be hale strong much le now when be weakened with privation wish to have blood upon hand came here to night be night interrupted other eagerly did not know that be night how must in place where there be day well be still more indiscreet of for will get away unseen while lie here unsought scheme be futile there be fifty men about pit mouth now have told liar solomon darted forward richard throwing away torch a though disdaining to use advantage in way of weapon grappled with at once at touch of foe scruple vanished hate returned with tenfold fury be in grasp of giant privation have doubtless weakened solomon have still strength of powerful man rage supplied for time with that have lost clung to one like snake whirled about with frantic violence whichever fell undermost be dead man for certain for few moment expiring torch still showed other hot vindictive face then battled in dark with laboring breath eager strain swaying knew not whither at last huge weight of solomon overbore lesser antagonist richard limb gave way beneath fell fell through space for in gyration have without knowing returned to top of ladder foe fast clutched fell with pitching on head be killed a have seen upon instant be true history of what have occurred in mine a richard on bed of pain recalled step by step strove to shape to end chapter xlviii making peace whether richard own injury proved fatal not be with matter of secondary importance anxiety be to prove that be received by misadventure upon whole matter promised favorably for be in other respect a satisfactory a must reasonably be expected blood of solomon coe be upon own head richard have need even to reproach with having struck in self defense blow killed enemy did not reflect that be still to blame for having in first instance placed in mine have at least done best to extricate conscience be perhaps naturally not very tender respecting man who have repaid attempt at atonement with such implacable animosity at event richard mind be too much engaged in calculating consequence of what have happened to entertain remorse question now monopolized be what conclusion be likely to be arrived at by coroner inquest must of course be held upon body verdict be of most paramount importance to not because upon depended own safety for valued life lightly besides inward pain convinced that be already forfeited now made life worth having good regard of harry son have no longer scruple on own part with respect to accepting returning affection fear be lest having be compelled to take so active part in rescue of unhappy solomon something must arise to implicate in incarceration fortunately be far too ill to be summoned a witness deposition alone must be taken that framed with utmost caution a briefly a be possible wounded lung defended from protracted inquiry solomon have proposed idea of partnership in wheal dane interest in mine knowledge of have suggested to richard place of concealment have evidently proved fatal to that must have broken neck just a richard have broken rib on quest be by mean extraordinary how ever reached spot where be found at without aid of ladder be inexplicable line of evidence be smooth enough for ugly knot troubled richard much though a happened unnecessarily have place of calamity be gravel pit at highgate must have be guarded by constabulary thing preserved a be until after official investigation wheal dane from having be deserted mine have suddenly become haunt of curious morbid there be nothing more likely than solomon ladder have be carried off perhaps disposed of at high price per foot a interesting relic presence of half extinguished torch that richard have flung away in second level must by right have be found in third be still more easily explained there be score of such thing now lying about mine have be left there by visitor in short active coroner intelligent jury must have come to other conclusion than of accidental death came to accordingly other comforter have arrived to wounded man before receipt of good news in person of harry son agnes there be reason why three must be now warmly attracted toward while effectually worked will in way gave many twinge looked upon a did rest of world a man who have lost life for wound be by time pronounced to be fatal to save friend told that be not so did not believe have not heart to tell how matter really stood praise pained more than agony of wound peremptorily forbade subject

domestic tyrant matter how dutifully wife son may strive to mourn loss be release memory burden that very willingly put aside in particular name be never mentioned before agnes without strong necessity mr coe always at best wisest in matter wherein son be concerned have never told girl of part robert balfour have taken against must have wounded self love to have learned that influence of comparative stranger have be used with effect to estrange charley must scarcely have made sufficient allowance for man of world insidious art notwithstanding circumstance have so favored thus harry have justly reasoned kept silence concerning agnes have therefore set down gradual cessation of lover visit to soho growing coldness solely to hostility of solomon have pained deeply though have be too proud to evince aught indignation still strove to persuade be natural that lad entirely dependent upon father for mean of livelihood daily exposed to menace argument must endeavor to steel against

together clung to charley on other hand with whom balfour have once be favorite felt though attentive to need by mean cordially toward gratitude for fancied service have done to late father compelled to give richard company be not accorded willingly a heretofore must not set down to account of companionship present frigidity of agnes at first have even seen material obstacle to hope audacious man of world who have at one time so excited admiration have suddenly become in eye impudent roue who even on sick bed be only too likely to make past adventure together subject of talk true mother have told that mr balfour be now altered man young gentleman have entertained reasonable doubt of conversion manner to sick man be so reserved cool indeed that seemed to richard who guessed cause of yet felt effect more bitterly than unkind behavior on part of former ally did not injure balfour in regard of agnes resented charley conduct did best to redress by manifesting own good will have have experience of shifting mood causeless change of demeanor perhaps be willing to show what small importance attached to capricious humor thus happened that richard got on together much better a well of course a much more speedily than former must have hoped for for indeed have with reason expected to find bitter enemy in agnes improved advantage to utmost by taking occasion in charley absence to praise lad under whose displeasure manifestly lay answered that have not at least from mr balfour lip deserved such praise nay nay said richard gently be who have not deserved lad good will dear young

lonely friendless a see be for three society of bright boy be very dear to selfishly strove to secure when must fain have be elsewhere needed a may well imagine authority to back in such effort unhappily for possessed aid now resents very naturally restraint companionship once imposed upon set down to account estrangement so bitterly rue old man friendship be of great worth at time weighed in balance against woman love sir interrupted agnes with indignation pardon continued richard gently see love be deeply grieved for sake of poor lad who be a devoted to a ever to find so to feel that be in part fault will ask to forgive if can nay mr balfour beseech do cried agnes with crimson cheek a please murmured gravely remember few day hence perhaps few hour may be beyond forgiveness will
