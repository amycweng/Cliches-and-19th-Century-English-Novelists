servant sir will not shake hand with man who ruin mother by gambling debt break heart with hatred of own brother be not true at least do hope walter said sir richard quickly false upon honour returned captain mother never told to say that sir not quite that did not admitted little old man whose eye have begun to lose hard inexorable expression notwithstanding harsh word from moment that walter entered room be so difficult even for social philosopher to be severe stern with young man yet be bound to say walter that be who have be most to blame with respect to good mother who only life for child whose very love for have compelled to withdraw from beneath roof will not now dwell upon clandestine marriage leave to imagine how want of trust in best friend a well a parent evinced in hasty

paid enough of already to seriously embarrass own affair have made solemn promise never to bet gamble more dr haldane said captain hoarsely be glad of walter what be about to say be that in case a well a in of marriage be not so much error a want of frankness evidenced by concealment of matter to be ashamed of having done wrong be proper feeling enough if be not accompanied by acknowledgment of

since happened day hour be quarrel between brother here doctor turned sharply round on young baronet who have be hitherto listening not perhaps without complacency to catalogue of brother misdeed think from what have seen richard that be who be most in fault here be use looking proud cold on never cared three brass farthing for such air though now then misbecame even poor father who be worth dozen of ridiculous assumption of superiority founded upon mere accident of birth naturally offends high spirited young man like walter who if be in place must certainly not make odious in way however might fail in other matter belonging to position suffers nothing readily allow in able hand that have administrative faculty in high degree sir concede be not russia if be be not czar man in mirk ever called tyrant dr haldane perhaps man ever dared sir dare to say that son whose conduct be such that mother can no longer bear to witness be something worse than tyrant be sure that if continue so to

very like to cain abel two young men embraced perhaps for first time in life oh when tell what have seen sir do think mother will come back cried richard with tear in fine eye can not say that be sure

doctor mistress forest re entered that silent room lady be upon knee beside pillow have closed dead man eye folded palm together taken from neck locket to be returned to by trusty hand when time came chapter xiv last if there have happened to be one upon whom poor ralph wild talk on night of abbey festivity have made serious impression whatever be destined to be removed by inquest followed upon death very word have made use of in fury calling lady wife stigmatising sir richard a natural son must have be held to be slight evidence of insanity however be abundantly proved by other testimony waiter at royal marine at coveton came in good faith to take solemn oath to best of judgment gent with beard who have scandalised that respectable house by taking brandy for breakfast be like other man alive a have ever served in other word be nothing short of lunatic postboys whom have commanded to stop let out before chaise must be whirled over first stage pronounced mad porter at railway station to whose civil inquiry a to whither be going angry man have returned so uncivil answer came to same conclusion man nearer home from lord lieutenant to parish constable even of whilom companion from captain walter lisgard to landlord steve gave a opinion that man be mad verdict of coroner jury being in accordance with evidence decided that deceased have met with death in manner with be acquainted during attack of temporary insanity induced by drink nerve of madame de castellan have received much too great shock from recent occurrence to permit presence at inquest indeed such effect did take upon that left not only belcomb england almost immediately declining with many thanks sir richard offer notwithstanding that letty drove over in person to make known to that must take up residence for present at abbey so madame went back again to native land a suddenly almost a mysteriously a have come after while wrote to inform english friend that domestic disagreement have driven from home be in fair way to be healed that be very unlikely that must have to trespass upon kindness more real history of lady coming to belcomb be never absolutely known to more than two person perhaps more le rightly guessed at by third from moment that lady recognised first husband in ralph derrick never concealed from possibility of having to leave abbey become perhaps lifelong exile from home friend for three child sake especially for of sir richard perhaps exaggerated depth to family pride have taken root in heart of eldest son honestly believed that knowledge of being illegitimate must have killed although must never have possessed strength of mind even have enjoyed requisite want of principle to deny in person ralph claim to a lawful husband justly argued that must be utterly unable to establish case in absence must summons witness whose testimony must go half so far a own tell tale face while own character be such that credence must be given to statement unless supported by strong direct evidence thus situated lady turned over in mind scheme after scheme of flight without hitting upon anything gave much promise of entailed residence abroad cruelly far from dear one from whom be about with such heavy heart to flee for own good when have perforce a have seen to take mistress forest into confidence something arose out of conversation between concerning old life together at dijon suggested that ingenious artifice eventually put into effect madame de castellan have be dead year though of circumstance lady child be unaware albeit sir richard have heard good deal of when boy have even dim recollection of personal appearance when be guest of father mother at abbey of remembrance lady took advantage mary in old school time at dijon have be used to act charade at madame house circumstance doubt put into lady lisgard mind idea of personating old frenchwoman lady have learned from amateur performance secret of green room metamorphosis be naturally endowed with small power of mimicry must speak french like native how few strip of black plaster on teeth can counterfeit age toothlessness let of fair reader experiment for supposing that desired transformation must be effected what securer plan one more unlikely to be suspected must be found than secluded cottage of belcomb so close to abbey whither news relating to child must be brought to at once through mary who be arranged must be transferred to madame service in manner be afterwards actually adopted letter purporting to come from dijon taken by sir richard own hand from post bag have be placed therein by mary forest who have used mistress key at earlier hour found that communication from arthur haldane concerning ralph departure for coveton necessitated such immediate action on part of lady there be not one day to be lost in making preparation indeed from time have be ready to start at moment notice though a happened there be need for such urgent haste counterfeit visit in person to abbey be of course running considerable risk establishment of fact of madame de castellan arrival at belcomb lady have rightly judged to be of paramount importance indeed that being effected be doubtful even if unhappy ralph have not met with so sudden end whether suspicion of madame lady being one same person must have ever existed most difficult matter connected with lady flight be in truth after to find reason for sufficient to satisfy mind of left behind child must have be slow to believe that must bring to leave home simply because two boy did not get on well together for in case absentee mother must be considerably more common than be fortunately not only did flame of discord between sir richard master walter continue to burn received plenty of unexpected fuel such a at other time must have caused lady unutterable woe under present circumstance be almost welcome to walter clandestine marriage with very girl to whom brother have offered own hand be incident so painful a to give lady excuse for almost anything walter have left abbey be important that must return thither make thing unpleasant a must not fail to do by mere fact of presence there with rose sir richard with fte in view be easily persuaded to ask new married couple down thing worked together for ill for once be lady good then again walter debt of full extent of however mother be never informed gave additional cause of serious dissatisfaction lastly sir richard opposition to letty marriage with arthur haldane made up very respectable bill of indictment at event a have seen be acknowledged so to be by party against whom have be filed conscience of sir richard walter be really pricked besides there be painful fact of mother departure from own roof owing to conduct whether justified such extreme measure upon part not moreover delegate to whom lady have committed disclosure of motif have be well chosen be necessary that third person must be admitted to knowledge of lady secret in order that affair might be transacted during absence might be prolonged for year even for lifetime where must find so tried trustworthy friend a dr haldane fact too of visiting abbey in person after interval of so many year even after so recent refusal to be present on important occasion of sir richard coming of age gave additional weight to mission upon came brought about a have be shewn genuine reconciliation between brother even exacted from solemn promise disagreement must henceforth cease be destined that good doctor friendly office must cease with when day came to lay ralph derrick body in coffin old philosopher nay cynic a many held to be placed very reverently with own hand little locket around dead man neck have treasured a most precious thing owned for more than lifetime on morrow when buried in dalwynch churchyard doctor followed to grave not only a deceased medical attendant a chief only mourner with tender pity for world battered passionful man who have

epitaph than be often to be read on tombstone after little good news came to mirk from france that lady trusting to what have heard from old friend be coming home again only stipulation made be that withdrawal from abbey be not to be alluded to by of family for indeed added there must be le necessity since principal cause of ill feeling between son no longer a be delighted to understand existed

understood in consequence of sudden death of madame de castellan occurred singularly enough almost immediately after leaving belcomb be thought very unfortunate that two old friend must thus have never be permitted to meet madame demise however of course left mary forest free to rejoin former mistress in whose company indeed returned to mirk have said that besides two person in possession of lady secret there be third who have shrewd suspicion if arthur haldane legal training have really enabled to come to right conclusion in matter also judiciously restrained from saying anything about

possible obstruction be removed in pleasantest manner by union of two young people happier better assorted couple be not fortune to know sir richard remains bachelor although a staid decorous in
