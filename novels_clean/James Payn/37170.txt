length be be sir returned mr gerard firmly have not shadow of foundation for assertion pursued mr clint reflectively slander will be pronounced malicious will be cast in swingeing damage be possible remarked host there nevertheless will be such revelation of sir massingberd mode of life a may well cause chancellor to reflect whether fairburn hall be fitting educational establishment for minor john lord eldon be not ascetic know sir broke forth mr gerard be well aware that be heartless scoundrel a dissipated a dishonest sir interrupted mr clint with irritation will not listen to such mad word may utter of course in own house not to be talk of who must subvert authority be not afraid to speak evil of dignity murmured tutor speak evil of dignity dear sir only of rogue who fill exclaimed mr gerard laughing however beg pardon gentleman remark escaped quite involuntarily be aware mr clint that lord eldon be not absolutely ascetic be about to say sir observed old lawyer stiffly that lordship be not so tenderly alive to necessity of moral training a of friend must wish have strong respect for natural authority must lean therefore towards sir massingberd view of question with whom indeed be personally not unacquainted be induced to palliate way of life sadder than orphan yet not fatherless be in eldon charge murmured mr gerard still continued in louder tone charge of attempted murder mr clint must have effect that even if marmaduke be reconsigned to uncle care heaven forbid eye of world must be upon sir massingberd must not venture to work mischief in meantime rest with to take good care that have not chance of doing so now resumed mr clint after pause supposing that be arranged thus far to repel sir massingberd claim there be matter to be considered must take long to

must borrow plenty of money if usurer be only confident that must a well a must make away with nephew there must be even le difficulty under ordinary circumstance in procuring loan for marmaduke delicate boy whose uncle guardian be bent upon putting violent end to see that render security so very slight altogether be certainly one of nicest case be not only question of responsibility there be always plenty of people ready to take amount of ithati at sufficient premium who will undertake pecuniary charge of lad if be withdrawn from uncle roof sir massingberd of course will never give up one tittle of allowance entrusted to to expend except upon such compulsion a must scarcely venture to employ there be three year wanting to boy majority even when have arrived at must be willing to promise ample repayment may die before uncle still who have constitution of adamant when who have maintained may whistle for money have expended expression may be coarse added mr clint apologetically think conveys meaning thank mr clint observed tutor after little pause for putting matter before so bluntly decidedly for part be far from being rich man on other hand there be person who have better claim upon resource than dear young friend pupil marmaduke heath that will repay if survives uncle be more than assured if die early will not regret that remainder of young life have be rendered happy through mean although may have cost few comfort stooped down said few word in tutor ear peter no continued be good lad father be doubtless generous enough to comply with wish must not resort to

took leave be not till left plantation far behind have ridden at speed for distance on open road be able to shake off sombre feeling oppressed to meet mr myrtle welcome to rectory with answering smile chapter xvi do sir massingberd little favour upon return to fairburn became object of immense curiosity attraction be stared at in rector pew at church in solitary ride went a repository of great secret of disruption between sir massingberd nephew be even whispered be prime mover of young man rebellion have planned very manner of escape upon panther including accident at event knew have happened nobody else knew except tutor now mr long be a close a wax many invitation have mr myrtle obtained of late to take dish of tea upon ground host have since stigmatized a false pretence a housekeeper confidential servant of rector have be asked by mr arabel of grange farm to take evening refreshment with in friendly way also by mr remnant who kept that extensive emporium in village supplied snuff to aged of sex though not gratuitously becoming cambric to young lollipop to who have not yet reached that period of life wherein outward adornment be preferred to inward gratification also by exciseman wife nay there be not anybody wife in fairburn having wherewithal to make tea table alluring being in sufficiently high position in life to venture upon step who did not invite mr myrtle to visit proceed to treat like refractory pump poured little down in hope to be more than remunerated for outlay although dear good lady be willing enough being indeed gossip born have nothing to tell be not equal to task of invention of fact even to trade upon in tea toast have absolutely none conceive then how face be turned interrogatively towards master meredith imri meredith now that object of everybody be to please how dame dropped courtesy hoped honour be well honour friend too mr marmaduke be well too trusted heaven bless be staying away from fairburn good bit be not how did have uncle like who have always kept at home so strict be true that be residing with mr harvey gerard well dear how odd be atheist democrat people did say there there be again a spoke well of sedate mr arabel set on without doubt by inquisitive lady even waylaid in narrow lane insisted upon looking in at farm partaking of casual hospitality ye will just have three drars spet said meaning by farm of expression few whiff of pipe take glass of ale when declined first offer upon ground of not being smoker second on plea that be only eleven o'clock be consequently rather early for ale confessed that missus be waiting for with bottle of cowslip wine seed cake of own making be rather difficult to escape from hospitable snare of kind revealed a little a possible without giving absolute offence on other hand received information detail of have not be confided to by mr long well sir remarked mr arabel after have told meant to tell be not much be wonder a mr marmaduke ishouldi have run away be sure good lady observed pray be particular never said ran away said horse ran away yes of course sir responded mistress of grange winking in manner made quite uncomfortable be very right to say that mr meredith very right sir opinion be that be planned from first to last only say nearly overdid ah indeed said how be well seems sir massingberd be quite deceived about horse bought for nephew instead of being quiet fit for lad be perfect demon be sheer madness of young gentleman to go racing in order to make run away then to arrange with mr gerard beforehand well must say must have thought that of must have have depth thank mr arabel said laughing be sorry entertained so low idea of intelligence well sir returned farmer wife with air of excessive candour husband see often have said to say 'that young squire marmaduke be darned if ai little better than fool know what shot to use for rabbit that never saw equal for ignorance a for lad from ingies be know sir well of young fellow turned of seventeen a ever saw be ' here mr arabel crimsoned stopped short a if have be very nearly betrayed into saying something be not entirely complimentary pray go on dear madam said 'of young fellow turned of seventeen whom have ever seen be ' well sir 'd just same opinion of a have of master marmaduke for part always said that although might neither on know so much a ought to though might seem a be ay always stood friend said be not such fool a looked did just so replied mr arabel simply so see have turned out if mr marmaduke can only live elsewhere till something happens to sir massingberd although indeed look a if nothing ever must hurt life will doubtless be much pleasanter than at hall be place for young gentleman like sureilyi although indeed thing be better there than be dark eyed foreigneering looking young person although indeed be old enough to know better well ishebei gone so have heard said drily yes went away in whirlwind ishei did continued mr arabel reflectively dear replied never heard that ah indeed daresay not why see mr long be little mixed up in perhaps thought better not to tell take glass of cowslip wine sir have be more than ten year in bottle cake be a good cake a will put teeth into in midshire though say a must say well thing happened in way see foreigneering female used to throw thing at folk dish plate came first to hand whenever be in tantrum mr gilmore have head opened with slop basin so that must lay finger in oliver bradford believe fired gun at charged with swan shot however at time be quite otherwise cry submissive a child said be religion up at hall know nothing about how must be hysteric daresay serve right too well who must come here very sunday after mr marmaduke have run away when sir massingberd be like wild man with rage must speak without blaspheming one of methodee preacher a sometimes hold forth upon common now foreigneering female be walking in park shrubbery with one of hysterical fit upon suppose what doe hear through paling word a suppose poor creature never listened to before presently out come upon common stand up among people with great eye swollen with weeping painted cheek always said be painted daubed smeared with tear carter john who be very much given to sort of worship be there told looked for world like woman in great picture over communion table in crittenden church who be wiping foot of lord with hair then preacher bade repent while there be yet time fear nothing only god sir massingberd came out dragged in from very preacher hand presently back again come with horse whip swears there will be methodees in parish if caught hypocritical ranter a called within hearing again 'd split ear now go with there pursued mr arabel gravely be for mr meredith to say a nobody ca pick up good unless be in church least of must such thing be said by sir massingberd who let that beautiful family pew get damp mouldy with fireplace always empty winter long never put nose into from year end to year end however what doe foreigneering female do declare must starve to death before must eat bread of unrighteousness longer not one morsel of food must take though locked up tried to tempt with most favourite dish so sir massingberd being at wit end came over to parson begged to come persuade woman to be reasonable take refreshment mr long at first declined to interfere in such matter at presently thinking poor creature might be really penitent although came about through methodee hoping to do good although not in way sir massingberd intended accompanied to hall what do think why found poor woman be in such earnest that have cut off whole of beautiful black hair there lay on carpet like so much rubbish so squire swore that did care now whether starved not turned out of house a said at first in whirlwind be very faint weak mr long who must never exchange syllable with before made mr myrtle give good meal gave good word sent away to friend for seems have friend poor wretch have made sir massingberd wilder than ever against rector whom have already accused of aiding abetting young mr marmaduke in running away so that altogether squire be ready to make end of everybody last statement although little highly coloured a mr arabel description usually be be really not far from truth did almost seem a if baronet be so transported with passion a to be capable of enormity what law permitted to do in way of oppression that of course practised to uttermost morality never very diffuse have concentrated upon one position defence of game trespass law keeper be exhorted to increased vigilance worst character in parish be constituted spy night be now custom of lord master to go round in own preserve visit outpost to see that sentinel did duty employed warning trespass board in fairburn park object be not to deter to catch contemners of sacred right of property in very act pursuit of life have become man hunting write that word without reference to marmaduke heath for indeed at time thought that sir massingberd have given up hope of recovering possession of nephew considerable period have now elapsed since young man convalescence yet baronet have taken no step to compel return have written indeed to marmaduke letter of anything conciliatory character calculated to re arouse lad most morbid fear mr harvey gerard have intercepted dispatch returned with answer of own composition have stated briefly result of late conference at dovecot respecting young guest have reiterated intention of bringing in court of justice gravest charge against baronet in case of legal molestation from have finished with personal recommendation to gentleman to rest satisfied with enjoyment of allowance be supposed to go to maintenance of nephew epistolary communication by hand be rendered impracticable on part of baronet by removal of dovecot household to town be bitter blow to lord of fairburn knew so well abject fear have inspired in unhappy friend that notwithstanding have come gone yet did not doubt that few word in own handwriting must bring truant back however loath be living now in such quiet time under protection of such equal law be aware younger reader will have difficulty in conceiving how one human being however powerful must be held in such terror by others be aware from first that present universal security must give narrative air of improbability fear that must increase a proceeds have only to say that at period of write there be poor man in fairburn parish however honest however prudent who might not have be lodged in jail at instance of squire must have found difficult to clear who might not on hint from same quarter have be pressed if did give opportunity on board man of war be likewise certain that have sir massingberd ventured upon step might have recovered possession of nephew at least withdrawn from protector by strong hand of law upon ground of mr gerard professing revolutionary principle in day of palmerston derby of tweedledum tweedledee be impossible for who be not old enough to have witnessed to imagine rancour of political party century ago despotism flagrant injustice be sanctioned under convenient name of order for haughty baronet to be thus cut off from intercourse with victim be to be foiled indeed at first stung well nigh to frenzy like scorpion within circle of flame after time white heat of wrath began apparently to abate seemed to have made up mind to sit down quietly under defeat to content with tyrannizing over who be yet in power comparatively peaceful state of thing be looked upon by mr long at first with suspicion at last with real satisfaction when sir massingberd sent over five pine apple splendid grape to rectory with compliment for first time within twenty year shook head tutor addressed messenger of bounty in word tell master be exceedingly obliged to for kindness danaos et dona ferentes must be so good a to write down sir said man may give message without tail replied rector little discomfited at own indiscretion congratulating very much that have expressed thought so classically when pine apple grape became common present from hall began really to think that stubborn old baronet have come to conclusion that be a pleasant to be on good term with neighbour a not that be genuinely bent on reconciliation soft answer be said to be efficacious to end be nothing compared to hothouse dainty out of season notwithstanding knew suspected began to regard sir massingberd heath not indeed with le contempt dislike with le positive loathing certainly with le fear have not set foot upon property since marmaduke departure baronet took occasion to stop a rode by gate one day remonstrate upon incivility of such course of conduct can do damage young gentleman that must take pleasure in park more especially a be not sportsman who must covet hare pheasant can not think that omission to do so be proof of ill feeling towards be not conscious of having deserved at hand spoke stiffly without condescension a man might speak to equal between whom misunderstanding existed unexplained capable of explanation foolish boy a be felt flattered by behaviour if least notion of making out to be hero have existed in brain when began to write recollection have be dissipated long ago have be quite a much surprised during recital a of reader have be at contemplation of own meanness if have known how many how serious be to be perhaps must have hesitated to recall commenced with a strong determination nothing to extenuate with respect to a to set nothing down in malice with respect to others thus will proceed to end while then matter be on le antagonistic footing when marmaduke have be away about year business happened to take mr long from fairburn be left day night own master have not be gone hour when mr myrtle came into study where be employed at book with letter in hand looked quite pale frightened a said lor ' mr peter if note ai from sir massingberd hisself for iyoui feel of tremble so a might knock down with peacock feather well said forcing laugh be not going to use such weapon mr myrtle what on earth be there to be afraid of in squire handwriting ca bite felt in cold perspiration nevertheless finger trembled a undid missive be polite invitation to dine with baronet that evening be not going sir idoi hope exclaimed housekeeper eagerly a soon a have acquainted with content of note why thing have happened for quarter of century will poison a sure a name martha myrtle never saw master eating pine apple without shudder rector iwasi uncommon ill after one of one day yes mr myrtle said quietly have suffered also from same cause think squire be to blame ai going sir be sure a master must like oh pray say ai going well then wo go mr myrtle fact be feel one of cold coming on generally begin with lump in throat so will write to excuse really have lump in throat heart have jumped up stopped there at mere notion of itete tetei with sir massingberd diversified intensified by presence of grimjaw must have gone through for thousand pound so wrote to decline honour upon ground of indisposition be compelled to keep house said for entire day hour afterwards letter arrived from hall since sir massingberd might not enjoy pleasure of company at dinner must permit to come over to rectory that morning have few word of conversation with upon matter deeply interesting to of there be getting out of if have gone to bed on plea of illness felt that even course must have be protection to sir massingberd must have forced dying man to play with at pitch toss if so inopportune game have happened to take fancy on other hand mr myrtle suggestion must mount horse ride away after mr long be really too pusillanimous proceeding therefore wrote back to baronet polite falsehood to effect must be very happy to see in very few minute afterwards be face to face with marmaduke foe came in unushered mr myrtle not being equal to occasion filling doorway with gigantic form well nigh touching ceiling of low roofed room with head be sorry to intrude upon invalid said what have to say be of private nature be not sure of finding alone at other time bowed begged visitor to be seated be something thought that man be civil at least for there be great advantage in being habitually insolent overbearing that when one doe condescend to behave decently people appreciate one good maimer very much have called upon continued baronet with respect to nephew friend marmaduke heath be idle to deny that have not be to one what mutual relationship must have led to be be naturally hard man loss poverty have doubtless rendered more morose marmaduke on other hand be of over sensitive morbid nature did not get on together at well there be fault on side be six of one shook head very well then resumed sir massingberd with candour let say that be who be in wrong have not patience gentleness requisite for dealing with character like temper be arbitrary have behaved with little courtesy even to yourself be polite enough to contradict nevertheless be true for ithati however reparation can be made wish must a easily make atonement in other quarter however feel be utterly impossible thing have gone too far make complaint of nephew having be encouraged in rebellious course by one whose duty be on contrary to reconcile wish to say nothing must only lead to fruitless discussion perhaps disagreement between must be most impolitic on part since come here to solicit good office mine sir massingberd mine yes desire kindly assistance in bringing about better understanding between marmaduke sir said what ask be sheer impossibility marmaduke heath may be wrong in estimate of character will remain unchanged to dying day be a certain of a yonder yellowing tree will presently lose leaf speak frankly mr meredith returned baronet calmly respect le upon account be not however a mediator need assistance ask much le favour than simply wish to inclose letter from to nephew sir massingberd heath said with indignation have done favour of calling upon in tutor absence in expectation of finding so weak a to be unable to refuse chose to ask so treacherous a to be willing to deceive who be generously protecting best friend from one whom have cause to fear be extremely obliged to for compliment with laid hand upon bell one moment observed baronet quietly nay with suavity though letter u upon forehead deepened visibly vein of great hand a rested on table grew big with passion one moment before ring be sorry must have taken view of conduct a have described young men be somewhat hasty in imputation of motive be straightforward rough fellow may have displeased be not aware have done anything to justify in accusing of meanness duplicity person who have charge of nephew be in judgment deeply culpable wish to act deceitfully towards on account matter have come to pas however can not even communicate with nephew even though have to say must give genuine pleasure mr harvey gerard deep voice shook with hatred a mentioned that name have taken upon to return letter to marmaduke unopened know not how to convey to even one a sir massingberd threw across to folded sheet directed to nephew motioned must open ran a follows nephew marmaduke seems that be fully determined never again to seek shelter of roof be given to understand that time for reconciliation have gone by that attempt to effect must only cause annoyance make breach wider between if so so be be old man now wish last year to be passed in peace wish to make allusion to character of person with whom have chosen to reside further than to express hope that when be gone will be part to exercise right of great land owner that will not employ influence to subvert law government be a mad in who posse authority to countenance revolution a for man seated on lofty branch to lop off with own hand say a uncle merely a one of ancient race with whom be connected in whose welfare must take equal interest mr meredith be kind enough to enclose parting word of advice last communication will probably ever pas between from massingberd heath p burn when have read lest friend must get into trouble upon account read re read strange epistle with great care before made comment upon there be nothing to mind objectionable in of content have be twice to harley street during summer found marmaduke a morbidly apprehensive a ever of course of conduct to be adopted by uncle with reference to regaining custody of person be haunted still by shadow of terrible man word held before be certainly calculated to reassure news must be more gratifying than positive resignation of baronet claim to be guardian final good bye under sir massingberd own hand a for political advice thought that very healthy be then a now staunch conservative although did not sympathize in least with harsh act of government in respect to poor misguided men not without wrong yet did think mr gerard view visionary dangerous trust observed sir massingberd gravely that sentiment be now perusing be in accordance with own be speaking believe to gentleman consequently to natural friend of order bowed in assent there certainly seems nothing in epistle marmaduke might not read muttered musing iseemsi cried baronet why not say iisi at once sudden idea gleaned from romance have be lately reading flashed across brain why did postscript say burn when have read let hand with letter in drop below knee so that missive be held close to fire there be writing in lemon juice do assure observed sir massingberd quietly will only scorch paper coloured at exposure of suspicion in confusion did not strike that speaker must have at least entertained such project never must have unmasked so readily be little ashamed of rather sorry for incredulity sir massingberd saw pressed point since there be nothing concealed harm in what be visible do hope will grant favour requested inclose note to nephew well sir said after little hesitation will inclose give warning however that will send line by same post to let mr gerard know have done so by mean responded sir massingberd be only anxious that nephew own eye must read what have written have taper wax asked folding up sheet might a well stamp with seal rose brought what required from writing table sir massingberd sealed letter gave into hand mr meredith said rising have done great service think have said that oftener make use of ground better will be pleased did add that bowling green be entirely at service be too stiff in back to have game with myself will give direction to gilmore to be antagonist whenever may feel inclined baronet took leave in stately not unfriendly manner certainly iwasi stiff in back be nature a smiled lip turned upwards instead of usual way so always did yet did not feel quite comfortable a stood by over fire balancing sir massingberd good bye to nephew in hand questioning within whether must be better to inclose to mr harvey gerard after however in end kept promise end of vol
