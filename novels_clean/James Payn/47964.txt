two seal hanging from on slip think sir said modestly have something rather curious to show eh what said mr erin knitting brow in depreciating manner peculiar to examiner of curio before purchase old deed suppose then turned very white eager sat down with document spread out before be note of hand of usual kind though of ancient date dealing with very small sum of money if have be letter from

marvellous discovery william henry said mr erin breaking long silence regarding son with sort of devout amazement such a might have be exhibited by classic shepherd of old on finding tityrus have be treating a chawbacon be first cousin to apollo be certainly most fortunate young manmaggie for maggie learning that visitor have departed have joined full of vague expectancy see what cousin have brought home with appeal of mr erin to niece be significant in many way must have be most natural in such matter to have turned to dennis for moment must not brook incredulity even critical examination of precious manuscript moreover have said cousin relationship between two young people to have never before alluded be plain that within last five minute william henry have come nearer to old man heart than have be able to get in seventeen year what followed be even still more expressive for took for granted intimacy between son niece up to moment have studiously ignored did know anything added girl of surprise cousin have in store for knew that there be something uncle though not from lip be continued with faint flush felt for day there have be something upon william henry mind judged to be good newswas not so willie young man bowed head colour came into face also how must have watched how rightly have read thought be what be saying to mr erin took notice of of mind have reverted to new found treasure look at dennis cried seal paper be quite a must be have doubt of being genuine deed of time then signaturethere be only two others in world do thinkjust take microscope own hand trembled so that must scarcely hold itthere can be mistake about be without can be proved that spelt indifferently again receipt have inconsistency in case of forgery must certainly not have be overlooked there can be doubt of being genuine signature can there be matter on be infinitely better qualified to judge than be mr erin be cautious rejoinder perhaps have better consult autograph in johnson steevenss edition tush do suppose have not stroke turn of in mind eye reach down book maggie margaret who knew where to lay hand upon book in uncle library made haste to produce volume there did not tell said mr erin triumphantly look at w look at s dennis did look at very carefully yes admitted there be doubt that be fac simile fac simile exclaimed old man angrily why not frankly say that be by same hand at once be begging whole question argued dennis honest implastic nature leading into selfsame error into have fallen at charlecote park be surely more likely upon whole that autograph purporting to be shakespeare must be fac simile than original in other word answered mr erin with burst of indignation be more likely that lad here poor william henry poor sounded almost like poor dear must have imposed upon than not oh oh interposed margaret earnestly be sure that mr dennis never meant to suggest that then what deuce did mean by fac simile ejaculated antiquary with irritation look at up stroke look at down stroke have made accusation against mr erin said frank dennis speaking under strong emotion be at once most cruel undeserved if thought capable of doing injury to william henry especially of sowing suspicion of in mind ii must go drown in river yonder mr erin only said umph in such tone that sounded like then go do how be possible that in throwing doubt upon genuineness of document continued other must be imputing anything to finder indeed have cast doubt on know nothing about then why offer opinion put in old man implacably at event sir hazarded none a to how thing came into william henry possession tut tut replied antiquary once more reverting to precious document who care how got point be that have here not only shakespeare handwriting most incontestable proof to such a ever doubted of honour punctuality in discharge of just debt william henry have be mistaken in lad will honestly confess have built such hope upon when lost poor samuel son died in infancy never thought to be made happy by anything boy must do again be proudest moment of lifeto have under own roof to see with own eye to touch with own finger actual handwriting of william shakespeare then with sigh like one who return to something fain must keep a knowing far more how to value folded up document returned to william henry nay sir said lad gently breaking silence for first time be yours not mine pleasure in acquiring itfor to say truth cost nothingwould all be lost if refused to accept what a gift boy be impossible dont mean that must take cash for for william henry looked abashed disturbed something will at least show that be not ungrateful for one instant young man believed that like stage father mr erin be about to place margarets hand in dower with blessing only walked to bookcase took from shelf where have just be reverently laid stokes vaulting master pushed into hand sir have not heard how gained possession of deed exclaimed astonished recipient of treasure to morrow to morrow answered antiquary a left room with document hugged to heart to morrow will be time enough for detail in heart of heart feared lest there must be flaw in young man story might throw discredit upon genuineness of discovery for night at least wished to enjoy acquisition without shadow of doubt chapter viii how to get rid of company when mr erin have closed door behind there be silence among have left dennis margaret naturally looked to william henry for explanation of so singular scene only turned over leaf of stokes vaulting master with amused expression of countenance reminds observed presently of what one of mr bingleys female client did other day have favourite cat one of toady used to extol in order to curry favour with when died left that a being richest legacy must think of mere money went to hospital margaret gave look seemed to reproach for frivolity dennis remarked gravely enough do hope there be mistake about deed of yours lad for be afraid must be terrible blow to father deed of mine exclaimed young man indignantly how on earth can tell whether be genuine not be very true said margaret how can must hope for best now tell where found willie about well queer story promise can only give word of honour for truth of must hope must be enough said confidently will be enough for maggie said young man quietly be very doubtful whether will be sufficient for others since even to myself must still seem like dream save for documentary evidence if be right a mr erin seems to think be right for be not responsible put in margaret eagerly just so know more about being shakespeare genuine signature than do how thing came into hand be way know horn tavern in fleet street dennis well of course did not dine with ten day ago there nay let be accurate throughout dined with said young man smiling reminds of what have forgotten before be on very day that first met friend did notice old gentleman with flaxen wig dining by in cornerindeed know did for remarked that be rather early in day for man to be drinking port remember making observation answered dennis can not recall gentleman did not notice with particularity seems that noticed took mid day meal there next day there be again sat at adjoining table entered into conversation with manner be at first little stiff reticent like of old bachelor who life alone something said about child bank seemed to attract attention be not aware that account for sale of dunkirk have be found among paper seemed more astonished must know again amazed to find knew about chaucer having beaten franciscan friar in fleet street being ignorant of course of set of people have be brought up amongst here doubtless astonished that so young man must take interest in such matter said be indifferent antiquary from incurable habit of indolence have grown upon during year of seclusion that taste have at one time lain in direction that possessed considerable collection of manuscript bequeathed to by cousin that if liked to look in upon at chamber in temple might perhaps find something worthy of attention of course availed of invitation found friend in unusually large set of chamber have appearance of great neglect room occupied be well cared for enough though informed that saw company others be used a lumber room be filled with old book old armour old manuscript piled up on floor in greatest confusion there be heap of law document relating to own affair have better treatment suppose new friend saw by expression of face thought very eccentric personage for suddenly observed have taken strong fancy to young gentleman be not easily pleased there be one thing must beware of if want friendship to continue can not be troubled with question man who left thing be worried to death by curiosity of other people where did get how did come into hand so on there be thing here possession of must be so envied by people must never have moment peace from importunity if must come across such treasure must reveal place where found part company let that be thoroughly understood between of course promised never to mention name address to one a william henry paused moment to take breath will be rather awkward observed dennis gravely of course there be help for inability to give reference a to discovery of deed will give rise to suspicion suspicion of what inquired margaret with flush on cheek of authenticity of document must rather have said must strengthen suspicion for there will be objector to be certain cousin have nothing to do with said margaret surely be not personally answerable for genuineness of deed certainly not answered dennis gently pray go on willie said margaret be plain that what dennis have said have annoyed in way not only be however quite unconscious of cause of offence william henry appeared equally in dark glanced from one to other with puzzled look before took up tale have paid several visit to templar a will call since then have be most kind hospitable a time be not own can only occasionally leave office have lent latch key so may enter chamber when please pursue research in order a believe to remove from unpleasant sense of obligation have asked to catalogue library for be of course labour of love why good lad be evident old gentleman intends to adopt will make heir exclaimed dennis though spoke laughingly margaret thought to herself that event be by mean out of range of possibility cousin be certainly very attractive have excellent manner a happened somewhat exceptional taste be most likely to recommend to patron perhaps future willie have proposed to in garden at shottery might not turn out so wild dream after think new friend have done enough for a be said william henry modestly in turning over deed yesterday found that document brought home to night mr mean templarwas not at home so have to wait till must see afternoon may imagine what twenty four hour passed noticed a told uncle that have something on mind said margaret have be for day doubt be making acquaintance with new friend possibility might arise from doubt confess allowed to indulge in certain hope returned young man with smile keeping eye fixed on ground what have happened howeveralways supposing that document be genuinehas be far beyond expectation when met patron told what have found be surprised enough by mean in state of elation have just seen in mr erin reason of be be convinced that at once made up mind to give thing be very curious said cousin always set great store by old manuscript did not know there be anything among so interesting a perhaps may find more at event since for discovery must certainly not have be made at least not in lifetime be fair that must reap benefit of note of hand be yours what gracious gentleman exclaimed margaret enthusiastically be not a if did not know value of what be giving away just so be afraid though begged to reconsider matter be not very urgent that must do so must not help picturing to myself how mr erin must receive such treasure how might be meanshere hesitated momentofmaking more acceptable to dennis patted lad on shoulder approvingly understood that in presence be painful to young fellow to allude to father habitually cold unpaternal behaviour what did not understand be that william henry must resent friendly encouragement a being manner of mature man to junior margaret for part attributed cousin hesitation to cause felt that if have be alone together must have ended that last sentencehow might be mean ofin different way in end of course continued william henry smiling took what god have given without much scruple even if nothing more must come of hope will never forget old gentleman kindness nothing under circumstance must be more moderate in better taste than speaker manner not only be there exultation such a might easily have be excused in man so young moreover so unaccustomed to good fortune seemed to have resolutely determined not to encourage in expectation yet there be confidence in tone to one at least of who listened to be very significant if be too much to say that pretty margaret have repented of promise given to cousin at anne hathaway cottage have certainly thought very unhopeful rather must be more correct to say have abstained from thinking of possible result at that night must not shut out from dream mr samuel erin must probably have also have dreamsnot le agreeable though of quite kindbut unfortunately never went to sleep like belshazzar beheld night writing on wall albeit be not in modern character needed in case interpreter be shakespeare autograph seemed to to be inscribed everywhere a though secret of luminous paint have already be discovered to shine miraculously out of darkness came down to morning meal with face of unwonted paleness when turned to william henry wore also unwonted smile listened to narration of how became possessed of deed with interest without much comment yet not word did say about precious document silence however be well understood there must day be gathering of shakespeare friend who must decide upon genuineness in meantime be clear that have firm cheerful faith in such a men pray for so often in vain for first time for year addressed conversation almost wholly to son even recalled event connected with young man childhood on later matter perhaps be scarcely safe to venture lest memory of le cheerful kind must be raked up with do remember boy day when be wont to spout macbeth together how have to hold up paper knife in little hand say be dagger see before william henry remembered very well said so be curious enough that shakespeare must be one common ground have discovered on to meet on term of amity then presently have heard anything of young talbot lately talbot have be that schoolfellow of william henry already spoken of who be poetaster like more fortunate however in worldly circumstance have succeeded to small estate in ireland where lived save when occasionally came to london for week two for pleasure on one occasion william henry have ventured to bring young man to norfolk street have be received with such scant civility by master of house that visit have not be repeated that mr erin must have given trouble to recall name spoke volume of shakespearean autograph thank sir talbot be to be in town for few day at blue bear in strand believe beg if see then that will give compliment said mr erin graciously transformation be quite magical be a though humble wight dwelling in shadow of king bulcinosos displeasure have suddenly become first favourite instead of receiving buffet have be given majesty hand to kiss margaret have never liked uncle so much a in new character be indignant with cousin that did not respond to father kindness with more enthusiasm if have behaved so to willie must have met way afterwards said reprovingly yes answered young man gravely because must have known that loved for own sake then with gentle sigh added why dont meet half way maggie did not indeed reply a must have have tender glance betrayed that if have not got half way be on road to meet went away to work a usual by mean in usual frame of mind be left behind le moved by late proceeding than before midday parlour in norfolk street be reception room of throng of dilettante summoned very morning by mr erin special invitation new found deed be handed round among enthusiast a new born babe heir to million about whom there be doubt a to legitimacy might be received by select circle of female gossip while proprietor like husband confident in wife fidelity regard investigation with complacent smile examined tenderly with great caution through spectacle of description in silence befitting so momentous occasion yet by countenance lit by certain fearful joy be easy to see that upon whole be satisfiednay gluttedby inspection illustration dilettante well gentleman inquired mr erin with mock humilitya mere pretence of submission to possible adverse opinion what say dear sir frederick what be verdict have appealed to one sir frederick eden shakespearean critic of mean distinction who being only titled person present might naturally be considered a foreman of jury be opinion mr erin replied that gentleman with great solemnity that most interesting document be valid hushed murmur of corroboration applause broke from little throng be view also said one mine mine added other voice if mr erin have just be elected king of great britain ireland with empire of india thrown in by anticipation be receiving first act of allegiance from representative of nation must not have looked more gratified serene be certainly conclusion observed with modesty have arrived at then told how william henry have become possessed of document narration redoubled interest excitement sir said sir frederick with emotion felicitate on possession of such son there be reason a know made congratulation mere matter of compliment up to time by mean acceptable one be with little pride satisfaction that mr erin now acknowledged be good lad said discreet well ordered lad of course be very gratifying to that have found favour in eye of gentlemanwhoever may beto whom be indebted for thisthis manifestation be strange word to use under circumstance not inappropriate one to mr samuel erin occurrence in question seemed indeed little le than miracle william henry instrument through have be vouchsafed to wondering eye what have to consider continued dropping voice in hushed solemnity be that in probability other paper connected with immortal bard may be produced from same source company nodded wig in unison be a though in mind eye dish of peach have be placed on table before very mouth watered there be one circumstance said sir frederick who still held document in hand rather to host discomfort who well knew what temptation be have become anxious for return of property think have hitherto escaped notice in examining document have neglected seal have just discovered by close scrutiny that represent that ancient game quintin here be upright beam here be bar here be bag company crowded round most of with magnifying glass gave appearance of beetle who with projecting eye solemn look investigate for first time new promising article of food at top of seal if be not mistaken continued sir frederick in pompous tone with air of man without whose intelligence great discovery must have passed unnoticed will recognise ring to unhook with lance be object of tilter if failed to accomplish bar moving swiftly on pivot swung round bag striking smartly on tilter back be almost certain of unhorsing see itit be here there be doubt of gasped excited company now mark be not only curious resumed knight corroborative of genuineness of document in very high degree observe very close analogy instrument bear to name of shakespeare be not almost certain therefore that seal belonged to immortal bard be always used by in legal transaction then rose hushed amaze of hand eye for moment voice broke awful silence presently under deep emotion mr erin spoke revelation said always need expounder in friend sir frederick have found one thanks to keen intelligence sir value of deed have be placed beyond question be very glad to have be of slight service to cause of literary discovery returned sir frederick modestly perhaps other light may strike if will allow to take document home with indeed will hing of kind put in mr erin precipitately not of course dear friend have least doubt of good faith added in gentler tone in justice to sonunhappily absent to whom belongsi can hardly suffer deed to leave custody perhaps at timefor friend be looking anything pleasedyour request will be complied with at present must be here for satisfaction of doubter such person have reason to believe be among even now murmur of indignation arose from side cast at one such furious glance a thracian nymph may have done before tearing orpheus to piece yes mr dennis continued host sarcastically addressing unhappy frank who have hitherto remained unnoticed quiescent have reason to believe from expression of feature when connect with certain remark fell from in shottery park other day that be only sceptic if to assembly of divine in convocation infidel so often alluded to in abstract in discourse from pulpit have be suddenly presented to in concrete must not have looked at with greater horror than with company regarded young man thus thrust upon attention indeed indeed mr erin pleaded dennis have never uttered syllable must be construed even perverted into doubt one may look dagger yet speak none returned mr erin with severity that must thus venture to misquote favourite bard showed even more than tone perturbation of mind document however will be left herehere repeated significantly for private scrutiny investigation only trust that may find cause to withdraw aspersion groundless in a be disparaging to dear son william henry offensive to respectable learned company about a see with regret to take leave if mr erin have suddenly seized hammer smote on forehead mr dennis must hardly have be more astonished than at gratuitous onslaught resolved to wait till company have dispersed at broad hint received from host proceeded to do then demand explanation mr erin however anticipated be somewhat more vehement dennis said in remark addressed to just now than occasion demanded fact be sort of diversion be imperatively demanded friend saw be getting turbulent discovery of quintin on seal be too much for already excited a be by exhibition of extraordinary document sir frederick in particular under circumstance of such extreme temptation knew to be capable of outrage made youi confess itthe scapegoat by mean of safety of precious manuscript have be secured in compensation take look at a long a like what said about incredulity though somewhat justified by past must admit be in main pious fraud like man of intelligence can not revere document be yours say for next five minute then go into iron case for who will be true to a whose honoured name lie there before in own handwriting have observed if be unsecret to ourselves chapter ix unwelcome visitor although may be very true that king can affect little happiness of subject petty king of householdfrom paterfamilias first down to latest descendantshave very important influence in way difference morose cheerful parent make in life of beneath roof be incalculable in one case atmosphere of existence be cloud in other sunshine must be confessed that up to period jupiter of little household in norfolk street have be something of jupiter pluvius there be storm there be tear even when be not so domestic sky be sullen from date of discovery however of note of hand from william shakespeare to john weather cleared moreover matter looked brighter by contrast be one of many advantage that selfish person of strong will posse that when do condescend to be genial people be prone to believe that always be so at event that have misjudged in setting down a churlish so in orient when gracious light lift up long hid head under eye doth homage to new appearing sight mortal look adore majesty mr erin domestic began to acknowledge master be not bad fellow niece to whom however be fair to say have always be kind be quite triumphant over new found good nature now willie did not always tell so c while frank dennis have reason to believe that have at last be quite forgiven heretical doubt a to whether deer must shed tear a easily a antler a to william henry stride have made in mr erin favour thanks to find of in templar chamber be something magical a if have got seven league boot on father even called samuel a though be verily indeed that son have lost with hope be wrapped up in must be confessed however that may have be partly owing to birth of new hope william henry indeed though have twice visited friend in temple since one momentous occasion have found nothing very newor rather very oldthere on other hand what mr erin justly thought great piece of good fortune one showed promise of much more have befallen on looking over patron paper came across deed of great antiquity in truth to gentleman be especially valuable since established right to certain property have long be subject of litigation for something be certainly due to young man since for legal learning knowledge of nature of document might easily have passed over a being of importance be therefore not so very surprising that old gentleman in sudden glow of gratitude for mind from natural leaning towards young fellow be a be ready laid have given promise whatever might henceforth discover among paper of general interest must by way of recompense for service have rendered become own gladly a william henry doubtless received mark of patron favour joy must hardly have exceeded that of mr erin when news be communicated to must need be confessed however that gratitude be not wholly dissociated from sense of favour to come why dear lad cried note of hand of shakespeare priceless a be may be yet outdone by what remains to be discovered in strange treasure trove of speak of content of a to nature value owner seems to be wholly ignorant there may be for know whole letter in shakespeare handwriting copy of play sonnet two possibly even skeleton of play never filled in with flesh blood character hint of divine tragedygracious goodness mr erin threw up hand in speechless ecstasy a though glimpse of heaven have be vouchsafed to of be not lawful for to discourse further of course be possible sir returned william henry gravely for part dare not trust to think of what may be lying in yonder lumber room just now indeed be giving attention solely to patron library arranging bookshelf making out catalogue after generous promise purposely forego pleasure of investigation lest must be considered grasping fire interrupted old man suddenly with tremulous anxiety think of fire know what happened at clopton house though of course patron must never wilfully destroy scrap of paper with antiquity about yet who can guard against accidentcarelessness one spark from candle world may be robbed of know not what oh dear lad for world sake if not for mine pray lose time never mind work ill settle that with bingley stick to lumber roomi mean precious manuscript dull not device by coldness delay eagerness of old man be in intensity quite touching lover entreating mistress for momentous monosyllable must have be more earnest even more passionate william henry who throughout late stirring incident promised to affect future so nearly have kept studiously calm quiet be deeply moved will do best sir replied in agitated tone nothing plea better than to give pleasure be well said returned old man graciously margaret looked on with approving eye supposing even what young man have so rashly set heart on must bear fruitif dream must not be realisedit be surely well that such friendly relation must be established between man who if not own flesh blood be natural protector be very satisfactory also to see that willie be responding to mr erin overture of good will a to last there must be no doubt a to uncle change of front towards cousin to whom indeed have hitherto shown front at have turned back upon very evening there be proof of a three be sitting down to supper william henry noticed that table be laid for four under ordinary circumstance must have taken for granted that dennis be coming knew that architect be out of town on business be not yet on such intimate term with master of house a to inquire who be expected guest supposed to be one of shakespearean literati who be now dropping in at time presently there be knock at door whereat margaret looked at uncle with significant smile uncle looked at william henry have got pleasant surprise for lad said gaily time agoindeed be before maggie came to live with usyou have friend whose companionship thought be doing good gave cold shoulder be never too late to own in wrong certainly did harm perhaps intended none be only natural that must have friend of own age that must be made welcome in father house so a told be in town sent round note to to ask to drop in to night to supper before william henry must reply door opened servant announced mr reginald talbot new comer be fresh complexioned young gentleman of about eighteen so rather clumsily built for age with long reddish brown hair bold eye did not look at like near sighted eye wore round neck what be then called quizzing glass held by hand through now surveyed present company attire if not more fashionable than mr erin guest be wont to wear showed much greater taste for colour waistcoat be heavily laced buckle on shoe if a be probable be not made of real diamond shone by candlelight a though have be be very kind of mr erin said pon honour to let drop in in way if have known that there be lady presenthere glanced at margaret bowed like dancing masteri must have put on more suitable apparel pooh pooh youre smart enough said mr erin in tone in contempt politeness struggled ludicrously for upper hand be only niece margaret slade there old friend william henry didnt say ladhere turned to son clapped on shoulderthat have got surprise for of course mr erin have meant well just a have done when have made that priceless present of stokes vaulting master a in case must have seemed to close observer that have not exactly hit upon meed of merit most to william henry fancy that young gentleman shook hand indeed with new comer cordially enough whether from surprise other cause must at first find better topic to converse upon than weather suppose said have not be having much more sun where have come from than have have sun echoed other drily suppose there be not much difference in weather of norfolk street that of strand have be in london a wrote to must be ten day not hundred yard away if have cared to come see didnt understand that from letter stammered william henry thought think can explain matter mr talbot interposed mr erin satisfactorily a far a william henry be concerned if somewhat to own disadvantage under misconception be unnecessary to explain have tacitly forbidden son to visit be sorry for hope will now make up for by seeing good deal of one while remain in town youre very good im sure said talbot looked from father to son in vague puzzled way then looked at margaret through spyglass young lady annoyed to be so surveyed cast down eye mr erin with revival of old caustic tone inquired do propose to deprive friend at home of society for length of time week two perhaps more returned other without shade of annoyance have evidently taken host remark au srieux be come up on business of own added grandly for a to old docket though article be not yet run out treat a please be in fortunate position of having competence of own conclude well yes be come into on majority something in land also in hand will then leave law pursue profession of man of letter heaven deliver ejaculated mr erin sir exclaimed visitor make thankful for mercy added host bending over plate beg pardon grace muttered mr talbot growing red to root of hair margaret reddened too for be not usual with uncle to say grace william henry reddened also with suppressed laughter have not given father credit for so much dexterity now daresay william henry must like talk with old friend in own room observed mr erin must make mr talbot quite at home here young gentleman looked a if must quite a soon have remained in society of miss margaret who have obviously attracted admiration while william henry must hardly repress groan so broad hint must scarcely be ignored two young men retreated together accordingly hope william henry be pleased dear said old gentleman when found alone with niece can not say have not made little sacrifice why have not be to see fellowi gave leave nay sir did not give leave implicitly said that if met mr talbot be to give compliment willie be always so very particular not to overstep permission in way mr erin muttered articulate sound such a bumble bee make when imprisoned between two pane of glass be not exactly hum resembled william henry be now that must wish to be there have be occasionsthough to be sure there be now no need to think of themwhen have not be so very careful to obey paternal command well hope appreciates little surprise murmured man of letter forsooth never never be so pestered by popinjay chapter x two poet illustration what on earth be meaning of be first question that reginald talbot put to friend when found alone together of what returned william henry indifferently here be pipe by way will smoke little tobacco there be again cried talbot say once more what be meaning of idea of respectable father permitting to smoke under roof why be only a be under protest that be wont to permit to breathe then a for used to think something worse than one of wicked anomalous emanation from grub street sort of savage with cash in pocket whereas tone to now be a honey of hybla what magic have wrought change in old curmudgeon well perhaps of late have got to understand better consequently friend suggested william henry oh cant be replied talbot contemptuously must say if knew a much about a did must behave worse to than ever dont mean anything offensive to dear fellow added speaker for companion face have grown very troubled on contrary compliment just quality admire most in must least recommend to good grace on other hand if have fault in eye be excess of caution come be frank with be tune have set rhinoceros dancing have have good fortune to find old manuscript have put father in high good humour young lady cousin be too enamoured of old manuscript well not that be aware of laughed william henry then congratulate be quick rejoinder be now obvious to that be enamoured of that affection be bespoken in direction from first be plain from manner in received advance advance yes have heard of power of human eye over brute creation well be nothing to effect of tapped spy glass upon sensibility of angelic woman have never known fail except when mind be preoccupied with object be writing epic to be entitled spy glass view of though founded on personal experience will be quite novel reminds how often have not read poem to one why have never come to see since have be at blue boar dear fellow a heard father say began william henry persuasively tut tut mean real reason put in other scornfully used to meet often enough when rhinoceros did not dance when be very far from dancing yet now fact be dear fellow interrupted william henry earnestly there be reason have reached that point already without guide observed other drily truth be pursued william henry mr reginald talbot took pipe from mouth laughed aloud certainly no diplomatic explanation must have be conducted under greater difficulty people yearn for fame dear erin said to others be very undesirable to be well known even by single individual if imagine wish to deceive talbot be quite wrong said william henry firmly be true can not be so frank with a must wish have secret be not own may be sure that must share listen then told whole story of acquaintance with templar singular result talbot listened to with great attention be very curious remarked when narrative be finished certainly great stroke of luck be like tale from arabian night nay dont mean on score of veracity for william henry have flushed crimson from parenthetic nature be story within story for if can stretch memory so far began with intention of telling why never came to see old friend at blue boar be because have time talbot have to do work at office also to attend upon new acquaintance at temple must be occupied indeed not moment in to say how dye do good morrow there be also father injunction thought fleeting visit a speak of must be worse than nothing must cause more annoyance than being neglected now father be friend will certainly find time to renew ancient day come be better now will fill up what be wanting in explanation make clear if please said william henry indifferently though be not aware that there be anything more yes there be cousin margaret said talbot with cunning air must have braved anger of rhinoceros followed own inclinationswhich flatter must have led to come see mehad favour be more important to than of yore hold in hand hand of have disposal therefore behoves to be on best behaviour have guessed exclaimed william henry with admiration if thought must have sympathised with a see do must have saved trouble of guessing sympathise with when be son of mus indifferent to love wound of friend have not always sympathised with one doe one except admire poetry a much a do can anywhere find friend more capable of appreciating higher flight of mine than have done good deal by bye in way since saw last erin not to mention six canto of spy glass have written one twenty song of may be useful to if inspiration have flagged of late for be to mistresswhose name like yours be fortunately in three syllablesa madrigal two number of miscellaneous piece chiefly satirical to morrowyou said to morrow thinkwe will devote to recitation william henry countenance fell have heard mr reginald talbot recitation before be not extempore have one fatal attribute in common with extemporaneous effusionsthere be knowing where must end if have be invited to recite own poetry must have be different thing nothing must be more agreeable to dear fellow how be to excuse absence from chamber then ill come to chamber instead of coming to will thus have opportunity of seeing how muse have progressed will compare note together to be sure be not a if have room to yourself there disagreeable fellow clerk of yours most unappreciative flippant person yes must spoil everything put in william henry eagerly be better must be alone together even for le time at blue boar very good then give a long a can to morrow want advice for fact be business on be come up to town be about publication of poem publisher can not agree about term seems strange since what want be money down perhaps wouldnt mind selecting few of very bestyou must rig out twin volume together like beaumont fletcher perhaps observed william henry dubiously have private pressing reason for conciliating mr reginald talbot to monstrous proposition a have just be made to felt must never consent must be like yoking pegasus to dray horse a regarded other matter be true that talbot be old friendsor rather must be more correct to say that have for year of boyhood be thrown into one anothers company bond of school friendship be however soon weakened under influence of other condition a hothouse flower fade fail in open air moreover when angered talbot who piqued on knowledge of human nature have habit of saying what thought of antagonist be not le intolerable if happened to be correct taste be true be similar involved rivalry perhaps be secretly conscious that other did not admire verse so much a pretended to do with irish channel between must doubtless have continued to get on capitally together a intimate path of

questioning such be admiration for nameless inmate of temple that respected wish for silence even a be at second hand behaviour be most acceptable to object more so since reticence mr erin thus observed in own case imposed upon visitor who must have otherwise subjected william henry to question forte et dure dozen time day have persuaded that if once mysterious visitor must get to know that

for first time began to believe in possibility of realisation of young man dream notwithstanding what have passed between have hitherto felt more like sister towards than lover be not that feared to risk wreck of own happiness by trusting to so slight bark that while matter be so uncertain natural modest instinct prevented from regarding a regarded there have be sort of false dawn of love with now that uncle seemed to give such solid ground for hope sun have long lain in wait behind cloud of doubt came out with splendour of morn love arose within a mr erin reverently placed treasure in iron

just a in old time black mail be wont to be given by rich to leading powerful robber a insurance on good so mr samuel erin did not hesitate to offer to more audacious formidable of learned brother bribe of most precious kind imaginable though thread taken from shakespeare lock gave pang infinitely keener than drawing out of own beard with pincer must have done actually distributed few of precious hair among friend placed reverently in ring locket may be sure that sir frederick eden have genuine hair two be whispered by envious who be many that upon application becoming numerous mr erin favour grew in proportion a lock did not diminish must only arise from other source of supply among recipient who entertained doubt among who received such sacred relic at there be who have hardihood to assert that human hair must have resisted lapse of time since shakespeare day even produced mr collett hair merchant who came to inspect lockfrom distance of several foot howeverand who have hardihood to express opinion in proprietor presence to describe effect of anger in aged person especially when accompanied with personal violence be painful to one who like present writer have respect for dignity of human nature so will draw veil over what ensued be certain that mr collett left norfolk street on occasion with much precipitationtaking four step led to front door at bound also left hat behind be thrown after into street must be admitted that objection be a absurd a be impertinent since be well known that human hair have survived many century of burial indeed when vault of edward iv who died in be opened at windsor hair of head be found flowing a strong a hair cut from head of living person sir frederick eden privately assured mr erin to be true since be not only present at exhumation have be so fortunate by mean of heavy bribe to sexton a to get of said hair for private collection partly from reason have be suggested chiefly from william henry remonstrance upon patron accountwho felt confident must lay embargo upon future treasure trove if must find report of what have happened to interfere with own ease privacymr samuel erin took little pain to circulate news of son second discovery nevertheless oozed out in spite of william henry found to be in respect public character called to see manuscript inquired also if young gentleman be at home to receive from own lip oft told tale of discovery be exceedingly irksome to must much rather have be reading talking to fair cousin let father have glory of exhibition explanation to maggie never grudged to inquirer be pleased to find be so much sought after took greater pride in than even uncle william henry went to new inn a usual be well understood that time spent there be of little consequence a compared with visit to temple mr erin ever thirsted for new discovery not only on own account because a justly observed greater bulk of more probable must genuineness appear to inclined to question antiquary demand not only treasure credit though mr erin entertained doubt must rather that other people have none just a gentleman who kept thousand pound note framed glazed upon mantelpiece not content with knowing be from bank of england resented imputation from friend of having be issued from bank of elegance moreover mr erin be secretly troubled at continued absence of frank dennis must a have seen on occasion even when there be occasion give rough side of tongue in heart greatly respected old man thanks to rather to temper have few friend bond united to possessed be source of rivalry disagreement denniss father have be a brother after former died mr erin have allowed young man familiarity to certainly none of year have be admitted before since professed just now to be absent on business business have never detained from norfolk street so long before mr erin reproached with having driven away by harsh behaviour even went so far a to confess a much to niece of course annoyed wench to see frank so obstinate in incredulity for that be incredulous about note of hand be certain can only say that never breathed word of doubt to uncle to yet know harboured doubt be confident reply stuck to even after sir frederick found out quintin on seal still only matter of opinion uncle opinion what believer in scarlet woman call inveterate contumacythey used to burn people for well dont agree with know smiled margaret be always stickler for right of private judgment antiquary shook head pursed lip only reply possible to under circumstance must not say when mean private judgment mean judgment coincides with private view perhaps have be little hard on maggie be what keep away wish be back again confession from mouth of such man be pathetic what conveyed a margaret partly guessed be that in crowd of flatterer secret detractor by whom uncle be surrounded felt loss of honest if somewhat too outspoken friend felt remorse too a well a compunction for in heart suspected that be cause of frank absence have doubtless noticed changed relation between herself william henry withdrawn without word of complaint from society recognised right have to choose for did grudge happiness found in choice must not endure contemplation of be out of question of course that must reveal to mr erin be too straightforward to corroborate view of matter knew to be incorrect dont think frank be one uncle to take offence at anything may have said to about deed be too sensiblei mean added with haste of one who withdraws foot from precipice nature be too generous to harbour offence really think that do returned old man in tone of unmistakable relief well in case just drop line let know how matter stand need not put upon at say miss society here very much a of course do margaret be greatly embarrassed task thus proposed to be almost impossible have never written to young man before to do so now in peculiar circumstance for purpose of asking to return to town must be very painful to might be misleading to like mr dennis very much uncle stammered just so interrupted antiquary scepticism of a be about to say be serious drawback still if can get over can surely make allowance for moreover when see lock of hair love letterand perhaps there may be other discovery by time returnshe must be very thomas not to believe such proof now if have be instead of william henry who have found precious relic must have indeed be well dont think must grudge poor willie good fortune sir returned margaret reprovingly be quicker than ever now to take cousin part uncle tone of regret have touched to quick made evident to that new found regard for adopted son be skin deepor rather manuscript deep pity for that have always felt have become deeper more tender sentiment given more courage to defend grudge of course grudge returned antiquary fuming only meant that if frank dennis have william henry gift must be perfect man can tell that if like for single instant margaret saw telling mr dennis felt colour rise to very forehead uncle noticed that there be hitch somewhere became naturally impatient at finding wish interfered with by scruple of slip of girl well write what will continued with irritation only see that brings poor margaret liked frank dennis a have said very much a have only too good reason to believe not so much a wished to do what have to say to be come to not for sake be parallel to nursery address to duck dilly dilly come be killed only be not to be killed tortured be use of compliment be like asking young gentleman to be

discovery newspaper magazine be full of good fortune even disputed genuineness of newly acquired possession made subject of continual comment added fuel to notoriety if such metaphor can be used without offence in case of gentleman of year learning mr samuel erin gazed at william henry with much same air of expectation a very sagacious old dog regard young master whom suspect of having toothsome morsel in pocket have too much respect for own dignity to beg for by sitting up on hind leg barking move tail from side to side mouth water young gentleman did not at first even produce prize sat down at table with cheerful nod seemed to say have found at last by sacred bone rest by avon stream be worth finding well willie exclaimed margaret impatiently what be young man gravely produced two half sheet of paper at sight of for knew that be not new bath post antiquary eye glistened mr erin began william henry why not call father samuel put in old man gently if be sense of favour to come moved be at least deep genuine sense of margarets fair face glowed with pleasure have often heard say father that wished above thing to discover what be in reality shakespeare religious conviction antiquary nodded assent said nothing intensity of expectation indeed precluded speech perspiration came out upon forehead distressed know to believe possibleas indeed language used by ghost in hamlet must seem to imply that be of catholic persuasion in profession of faith found at stratford spurious put in mr erin mechanically that fool malone believed in nobody else be not quite in

even if must turn out shakespeare be not so good protestant a ought to be value of genuine manuscript be not to be depreciated well have be day so fortunate a to discover what will put doubt at rest upon point shakespeare be protestant thank heaven murmured mr erin piously if have done son have advanced claim of true religion quickened step of civilisation throughout world margarets eye opened

be little difficult of accusation must bring against that of want of simplicity dear maggie be certainly most frivolous vexatious know be frivolous replied margaret with sly look at smiling cousin certainly did not intend to be vexatious uncle nay nay be only quoting legal phrase said mr erin have gently drawn two precious ms to placed elbow on of in sign of having taken possession in case of kind need not say that anything in way of criticism a to idea style must be out of place indeed blasphemous one can blame for seeking in proper spirit for enlightenment on point margaret looked up at william henry with half roguish wholly charming smile inquired may dear maggie returned young man laughing outright why of course may even if detected immortal bard in error must be business of mine to defend must think not indeed muttered mr erin what be thinking said margaret be that if willie mr talbot who informed other night know that be poet have written line about spreading wing over

forgiven young fellow former doubt though to eye of faith little flaw be of consequence must certainly give occasion not only for ungodly to blasphemefor that must do in casebut to waverer to cling to doubt if on spur of moment mr erin must have explained matter to own satisfaction must have felt qualm be secretly conscious that theory of evergreen tree must not hold water might satisfy modest inquirer like margaret hard headed unimaginative fellow like frank dennis must not be so easily convinced a for william henry although frank be by mean ill friend be not likely that must have be pleased to see visitor whose presence must need interrupt tte tte with now indulged evening with margaret though be no longer jealous of former rival be certain that must much have preferred room to company welcome be given by three to new comer be however cordial enough be come dennis cried mr erin taking bull by horn in very nick of time william henry have to day found treasure beside previous

countenance have be full of friendship though when turned to margaret have have thought expression of gentle melancholy fell a uttered word gravity little short of disapproval seemed to take possession of hang fellow murmured mr erin to he beginning to pick hole already be most marvellous conclusive evidence went on aloud of shakespeare adherence to protestant faith that heart can desire

presently be made by much le friendly critic why must not have be content to let matter take own course a willie always be on brow on other hand there sat complete serenity from very first attitude

amicable look when marked eye pas over weak point in armour with be acquainted without stoppage brow cleared little gave sigh of relief well inquired gently what say have found error doe seem to straight sailing have really rather not express opinion said dennis quietly if press must need confess that whole composition strike a rather rhapsodical doe then on part must need confess returned antiquary with laborious politeness have misfortune to disagree with to observation young man answered not word face looked very grave thoughtful like of man who be in doubt about important course of conduct rather than of mere literary inquiry nevertheless word when did come seemed to concern with latter topic only doubt said whether word accedehere pointed to phrase after deathe be acceded towas in use in shakespeare time what if be not broke in antiquary impatiently how many word in old time be found in most correct writer must be vain to hunt for in dictionary word though destitute of

protest against whole document now that have failed be very unwilling to offer anything further in way of disparagement have reason for absolutely declining to fall in with mr erin view in matter must

suggestion why be leafy instead of leafless must think be simply because writer made mistake observed dennis quietly everybody speaker included expected outburst shakespeare must have made mistake be

document then just a matter of form be so good a to add name to already lengthy roll of shakespearean critic will be very keystone of edifice of faith face of of enthusiast at modest reasonable request must fall from zenith to nadir must not eat own word looked a if must like to have eaten mr samuel erin william henry who have strong sense of humour be sometimes compelled to rush from room

examination cross examinationsfor when be sceptical be cross examinationstheir pomposity pretence be well nigh intolerable dont know whether patronage contempt be most offensive be quite true that

sat at head of table in shakespearean chair that have purchased at anne hathaway cottage profession of faith be spread before learned epicure a though be something to eat eye devoured william henry have chair to little removed ready to answer inquiry be by far most serious examination to have be subjected acquitted very well have nothing said to tell simple truth a to genuineness of document in question knew nothing have not even opinion to offer on subject visitor be not mr erin personal friend did not fall into rapture affect to do so be by mean so courteous a ordinary folk who came from curiosity have be invited for special purpose of having mind satisfied of coming to adverse conclusion be like star chamber did not a seemed to william henry spare thumbscrew boot after hour two of gentle pressure mr warton observed testimony young man so far a go be satisfactory to while behaviour doe great credit yes assented dr parr think mr erin have son of whom may be justly proud heard address a samuel be gratifying coincidence to that be also baptismal name mr erin felt that must be discourteous a well a embarrassing to undeceive then mr pye be asked to read profession of faith

personal importance to suffer by comparison with of others have preferred to come alone face be fat puffy exhibited unparalleled self sufficiency have sharp nose double chin eyebrow superciliously elevated carried gold headed cane in hand clasped behind spoke in thick slow voice mr erin received with great respect submitted literary treasure for examination with unwonted humility investigation be prolonged apparently exhausting one for visitor called three time a though have be in public house for hot whisky water a dr porson have drunk all there be in case margaret who kept key of cellar took in fresh bottle curiosity compelled to remain presence seemed somewhat to distract attention of guest from precious manuscript doubt authentic murmured devilish pretty antiquity be stamped upon right sort of antiquity suggested mr erin have stamp of time just so must think twenty year of age at most sir ejaculated host mean usquebaugh explained visitor twenty year in bottle at leastdid say at most plump here margaret be about to beat retreat when gentleman rose one moment young lady said know who be will be something to tell childrens child james boswell of auchinleck esq here suited action to word chucked under chin william henry felt greatly inclined to resent liberty mr erin only smiled approval glass said mr boswell proceeded with investigation presently without word of warning threw on knee pressed lip to m kiss invaluable relic of bard said thank heaven have lived to see must that late revered friend great lexithe great lexicog emotion of various kind prevented completion of sentence mr erin led with gentle violence to table on lay list of signature to added name though must be confessed in handwriting be rather illegible chapter xv at member of little household in norfolk street be now in great content that word indeed scarcely describes state of mind of head of house who be literally transported with joy be difficult to identify jubilant triumphant old fellow with grudging smileless to say truth somewhat morose individual have be few month before regard for william henry began to be quite troublesome for though have not least objection to margaret son being alone together must often interrupt little interview from excess of solicitude upon account that somewhat flippant young gentleman used to compare parent on occasion to sweete chickenne of shakespearean profession be always hoverrynge over herre broode indeed affectionate anxiety be partly due to certain apprehension old gentleman experienced when goose laid golden egg for be out of sight at present however a margaret reminded cousin there be not enough of themthough so far a went have very material valueto become nest egg must not be considered a saving capital to appreciable extent be not indeed theirs at having be made over to mr erin for object young people have in view be one a though have remained own if play of shakespeare even part of play must chance to turn up among treasure of temple must indeed be fortune to at event must procure antiquary consent to everything ensure favour in perpetuity idea occurred to margaret only in vaguest way even in william henry mind did take well defined shape nature to do justice be by mean mercenary if must only have called margaret own must have be content a to being able to maintain have always have good opinion of own talent though praise with be now overwhelmed from so many quarter have of course reference to helped to increase self confidence in comparative prosperity being of disposition be by mean inclined to triumph over unsuccessful rival somewhat distressed to find frank dennis standing somewhat aloof visited house indeed not so frequently a have be wont a regarded william henry at least not upon same term have always be friendly to younger man under circumstance when must have be excusable if have be otherwise now avoided not in marked manner certainly with intention if have avoided margaret also explanation must have be easy be not so be not indeed on same term with young lady a have be did not a of old seek society face did not brighten up a be wont to do when addressed treated with respect if be not tender be full of gentleness whereas to william henry be even cold be significant proof of transformation have taken place in mr erin that not only noticed in manner apologised for to william henry be sorry to see dennis lad dont seem to get on together so well a used to do must not mind being little jealous at young man face flushed for jealousy have just then with one meaning thought that father be about to talk with about margaret niece be not in old man thought at be not one went on who can bear to see good fortune of friend with equanimity especially when take form of such stroke of luck a in case what dennis say to be why must not have discovered ms instead of william henry not having done so be little bit envious of be inclined to decry be pity of course can do more harm by than can harm shakespeare by discrediting work of hand young man be sorry nevertheless margaret be still more grieved since dennis have tacitly consented to changed relation with cousin at event have made opposition to thought might have forgiven a have forgiven be subject on must not speak to occasionally there be something to sensitive eye ear seemed to be something in tone manner not resentful a though pitied for choice annoyed exceedingly feeling be in way reciprocated be impossible for margaret to ruffle frank dennis rarely came to norfolk street now unless by special invitation have be proposed by mr erin that must all four go to vauxhall together upon certain eveninga very unusual dissipation for except theatre of when shakespeare be acted in day be very frequently be pretty constant patron antiquary have love for place of amusementbut frank dennis have declined to accompany professed to have previous engagement a went out very little seemed improbable indeed be understood by others that did not wish to go be cause of sincere regret to not excluding william henry for if dennis have come must have paired off with mr erin left margaret to expedition however be looked forward to with pleasure by young people even a be have charm of novelty for for william henry be almost a great stranger to what have now begun to be called life in london a cousin little trip to place by water be delightful while garden with coloured lamp music gaily dressed company seemed to like dream of paradise mr samuel erin be not indeed very good cicerone to spot for folk of age though must have be invaluable to distinguished foreigner with thirst for information reminded rather informed for knew very little about how for more than century

attractive be than rival ranelagh of nevertheless a walpole humorously writes lord chesterfield be so fond that ordered letter to be directed thither be with difficulty old gentleman be persuaded not to take away from radiant scene to neighbouring street to see lodging where poet philip have breathed last by way of reprisal for preference for such gaud tinsel quoted to after dr johnson xerxes remark about army that be sad to think that of brilliant crowd not one must be alive hundred year hence scripture admit that there be time to laugh time to play literary reminiscence much more didactic reflection be felt by young people to be good deal out of place if mr erin must have be induced to visit lodging of mr philip by to meditate on future alone in maze then indeed must have applauded a be company be trifle triste illustration vauxhall garden be presently relieved from however in wholly unexpected manner have explored walk promenaded area listened to band to heart content have just sat down in one of arbour to modest supper when who must pas by with hat on one side air of studied indifference to commonplace allurement around mr reginald talbot few week residence in london have effected revolution in nevertheless must scarcely be called reform from inhabitant of connemara other out of way spot have become citizen of world dissipation of town have not improved appearance face though still full have lost colour have lack lustre look so ably seconded attempt at languor that almost rendered idiotic william henry drew involuntarily back in box to avoid recognition mr talbot eye roving everywhere though with somewhat fish like expression in search of female beauty have already be attracted by margarets pretty face did not quite recognise probably owing to doubtful aid derived from spy glass be evident that be struggling with reminiscence why surely be young friend talbot be not samuel exclaimed mr erin with effusion held out hand to young man at once not because be glad to see far from because thought be making friend of son welcome william henry however be well convinced that talbot be no longer friend circumstance have not hitherto distressed indeed have by mean regretted little tiff since have be mean of keeping talbot away from norfolk street now that have met again have reason for wishing that have not quarrelled very cordiality with other addressed aroused apprehension for knew that be feigned must much rather indeed have seen a on occasion when have last met make advance to margaret herself of be sure dandy whether metropolitan provincial must knew ever rival in affection fellow smarting from slight have be put upon muse might injure in other way knew from experience mr reginald talbot be capable of being what at school be termed nasty ie malignant have be said of great marlborough whenever permitted noble phrase be sure sign that be about to commit baseness similarly fact of mr talbot being upon best behaviour be symptom dangerous to friend on present occasion be studiously genteel manner to margaretvery different from that generally adopted towards fair sexwas distantly polite while to mr samuel erin be respectful to servility what especially marked abnormal condition of mind showed feeling to be under severe restraint be that never alluded to own poetical genius in speaking to william subject might well indeed have be avoided a painful one that must exercise reticence with respect to antiquaryto whom on previous occasion will be remembered have mentioned within first five minute that be man of letterswas something portentous did not indeed talk much did what be thousand time more difficult to himhe held tongue listened circumstance joined to demure behaviour caused mr samuel erin to take much more favourable view of son friend than that have originally entertained finding deeply interested in country of birth in early history related to at considerable length story of disruption of knight templar escape of survivor to ireland of happened to have account in black letter hoped a said at distant date to have pleasure of showing mr talbot under own roof naturally led on to conversation respecting labour of mr erin in shakespearean field concerning young man paid several compliment wherein what be wanted in appropriateness for young gentleman laboured under disadvantage of knowing nothing of subject be more than compensated for by impassioned warmth then by easy gradation fell to talking on new found manuscript amazed mr erin to find that talbot have not yet seen profession of faith have be out of town sir replied for falsehood to son of erin be a natural a mother milk laid on like water on perpetual supply system have not have opportunity of seeing though a may well imagine have heard of little else reminds have favour to ask of there be old friend of mine rather of late father mr albany wallis mr erin frowned have heard of gentleman put in stiffly in sense know trust know nothing to disadvantage sir said talbot with humility can only say that have always spoken to of of extraordinary erudition attainment with greatest regard consideration indeed returned other still drily with relaxation of stiffness in tone be only acquainted with mr wallis by hearsay judging by company keepsfor be known to be friend of one malone of whom in christian charity will say no more than that be fellow whose willow pretence pompous ignorance must disgrace name of charlatani have certainly hitherto have bad opinion of of sir be aware said talbot trouble just now exceedingly sense of ill will have prevented although near neighbour from calling in norfolk street knowing be friend of son have earnestly entreated in case have opportunity to beg permission for to pay visit from twelve to one sir shakespearean manuscript be open to inspection of comer said mr erin with grand air invite investigation even criticism time of course choose to appoint will suit friend said talbot a led to understand have matter of importance connected with manuscript to communicate to somewhat of private nature then let come to morrow evening when will be alone perhaps must like to see william henry think must sir returned talbot a spoke put hand up to mouth to conceal demoniacal grin such a one see on gargoyle carved by piety of monkish architect ill bring to morrow during time william henry margaret in opposite corner of arbour have carried on smothered conversation with one on quite different subject rather a manner of young people be under similar circumstance on subject at be enough to that hand met under table heart met under rose scene looked upon be not more bright than hope music listened to more in tune than tender fancy when mr erin pulled out watch pronounced time to set out for home seemed to that have only just arrived a for mr reginald talbot for last hour so have be totally unconscious of presence when took leave of did with much politeness there be something of suppressed triumph in voice that aroused william henry suspicion shudder involuntarily seized felt like merrymaker at festival who suddenly look up into sky perceives instead of sunshine ragged rim of thunder brooding low chapter xvi bombshell be significant of sensitiveness of mr erin feeling in regard to new found treasure though by mean indicated want of soundness in faith that ignored a much a possible attack upon authenticity by mean involved shutting eye to indeed have privately procured read have be written about ms even to terrible letter of lord charlemont to malone in have said be only sorry that steevens rival commentator be not proprietor of in order a meant that might have have additional pleasure derived from private enmity of exposing sensation antiquary endured from thing be something like of regulus rolling down hill in barrel stuck full of nail knife must not resist temptation of reading more than patient with hay fever in eye can resist rubbing have known young author afflicted with same mad desire of perusing disagreeable criticism can lay hand on thing be much more than criticism be personal imputation of vilest kind at same time law of libel must touch ate into poor antiquary heart never talked about if have perhaps must have be made more tolerable by sympathy of friend argument of partisan except to ignored did not even mention to william henry that one mr albany wallis whom have reason to believe be little better than infidel be coming to norfolk street by permission to examine shakespeare paper weighed upon own mind nevertheless actually regretted that frank dennis chanced to drop in afternoonloyal though knew to be in other matterslest in lukewarm faith if faith must be called at must let fall anything to encourage sceptic thus came to pas that when servant announced mr reginald talbot mr albany wallis be only mr erin who felt astonishment william henry be amazed for though have parted from quondam friend on previous evening on be outwardly good term there have be pretence of renewal of friendship between meeting at vauxhall have a know be accidental talbot have not dropped hint of renewing visit to norfolk street young man have smiling scarcely genial air manner be constrained thing being contrary to habit sat very ill upon addressed solely to host for indeed errand be sufficient excuse permit sir to introduce to friend mr albany wallis gentleman like well versed in shakespearean lore mr walliss name be not unknown to answered antiquary coldly have pleasure of speaking to late mr garrick man of business have not visitor thin grey man with sharp intelligent feature by mean devoid of kindliness bowed courteously have that honour replied gravely have also be acquainted life with many who take interest in drama especially shakespearean drama that of differ from mr erin on subject on have called to day be of course aware believe come in unfriendly spirit take for granted that be equally interested in establishment of truth be to be hoped so returned antiquary with dignity must like conclude to see profession well sir not immediately have other document a be informed in one of be more particularly concerned very good margaret be affair seems said antiquary smiling be relief to mind that profession at least be not about to be impugned here be key of chest bring out shakespeare letter verse with lock of hair for moment two mr wallis remained silent eye followed margaret a rose to obey uncle request with curious look of gentle commiseration in did not know that young lady have anything to do with discovery answered have sir hair verse have become in manner own property that iserunder trusteeship be disinterred from mass of ancient material by son here william henry mr wallis turned face on young gentleman thus alluded to much a policeman flash dark lantern on suspected stranger there be commiseration in now be keen even hostile glance see besides reputed epistle to anne hathaway there be think note of hand purporting to be written to shakespeare from john hemynge dont know a to reputed purporting sir returned antiquary stiffly be adjective not usually applied to document professedly genuine at event under roof of possessor be right beg pardon mr erin put in visitor apologetically one have right to prejudge case of one have only heard ex parte statement be however that particular document ask to look at gentleman upon whose word can rely have seen assures that signature of john hemynge appended to receipt isnot to mince mattersa forgery antiquary started to foot do come here to insult sir inquired angrily mr erin far from returned other firmly one must be better pleased on own account on of belonging to youhere eye lit once more on margaret who have flushed to foreheadif must find informant mistaken fact be posse deed with authentic undoubted signature of john hemynge friend who have seen of assures be wholly different from attached to new found document assertion however a may reasonably reply be out of place in matter question be merely one of comparison have objection to applying test most certainly not sir margaret gentleman wish to see note of hand margaret brought from iron safe gave to mr wallis face still retained trace of indignation eye met of visitor with resolution even defiance if there be fraud here said to girl have nothing to do with behaviour of mr erin have also impressed favourably with of william henry be not so satisfied seemed to to have too much sang froid then a frankly confessed to have be prejudiced against mr wallis be man accustomed to thread labyrinth of mind in matter more important at event more serious than literary investigation have very observant eye conclusion came to be that if there be one person in present company more guilty than a regard shakespearean fabrication a malone have called be mr frank dennis have not indeed uttered one word when girl have approached safe there have be unmistakable sign of trouble in face while at moment when a mr wallis knew a other must need suspect damning proof of worthlessness of one of vaunted discovery be about to be produced exhibited anxiety apprehension to do justice be absent from rest be mortgage deed executed by john hemynge observed mr wallis drawing document from pocket concerning genuineness of there be dispute be found among paper of featherstonehaugh family to whom nation be indebted through late client david garrick for shakespeare mortgage now in british museum if signature of yonder deed tally with well good will believe be pleased to find so if doe not do so there can be question a to be spurious one threw mortgage on table stood with air if not of indifference of one who have personal concern in matter on hand while mr erin compared two signature with minuteness presently beckoned to son in agitated manner eye be better than mine said what do make of william henry just glanced at two document in perfunctory manner a though have be asked to witness signature of client of employer quietly answered be very dissimilar whichever be wrong one can hardly be called imitation for have not letter in common with other there be question young man a to be wrong one remarked mr wallis severely a to imitation be clear enough that deception however clumsily have be seriously attempted only doubt have to clear up be who be forger mr walliss glance flashed for instant upon frank dennis be standing apart with hand over lower part of feature eye fixed on ground looked like one upon whom blow long expected have at last fallen be strange thought mr wallis talbot who have seemed so convinced of younger erin guilt have have not word to say about other fellow own impressionone of sudden conviction to men of stamp be especially liable must be last to call inspirationswas that affair be conspiracy in two young men be alone concerned that moving spirit be dennis suddenly silence be broken by margarets clear tone mr wallis have not examined deed said there be need young lady since uncle cousin have already admitted discrepancy returned visitor be only following example of gentleman yonderhere indicated frank dennis with forefingerin taking matter for granted frank removed hand from mouth showing face ghastly pale quietly answered be judge of thing if have made charge a have done sir think a miss slade suggests must give trouble of seeing with own eye whether be substantiated nay said margaret quickly spoke not of charge if thought that mr wallis be making personal accusation must not have addressed at really young lady protested mr wallis there must be something wrong somewhere know must rather think there be observed mr reginald talbot with snigger who devil asked opinion inquired mr erin with eager shrillness of steam boiler have just discovered safety valve did not forget that be to young gentleman good office that be indebted for unsatisfactory state of thing well thought be matter of criticism murmured young irishman be very reason sir must have held tongue be uncompromising reply really dont know observed william henry who have be idly turning over leaf of mortgage deed during discussion why bitterness must be imported into discussion be equally interested a mr wallis have remarked in establishment of truth for part have nothing to fear from be in way responsible a must be aware for genuineness of document in question only for discovery what have happened to day be doubt a disagreeable a be unlooked for be fault of mine only course open to be suppose to go to friend in temple acquaint with what have happened perhaps may have explanation to offer upon subject must very much like to hear said mr wallis with dry smile mr reginald talbot also began to smilealoud caught mr frank denniss eye have so unmistakably menacing expression in that snigger perished in birth will go father inquired william henry for antiquary sat like one in dream turning over note of hand once so precious to have now become waste paper yes go will wait here till come back answered word dropped from lip like lead chapter xvii mare nest great poet have sung of certain tea party a sitting silent damned be going pretty far a description of social cheerlessness be at tea have presumably bread butter possibly even muffin before whereas little party in norfolk street who sat awaiting return of william henry from problematical patron for mr albany wallis for one did not believe in existence have not even such material comfort to mitigate embarrassment ennui on table there be only two deed one of be in probability forgery mr erin sat drumming finger upon endeavouring to hide anxiety consumed most depressing spectacle company too be on anything good term with one with mr albany wallis be just kind hearted man knew be right be equally certain that be uncomfortable margarets beauty have touched indignation however undeserved distressed felt convinced that at least be innocent of confederation with evildoer whoever be now that have once put hand to plough there be possibility of drawing back must need lay whole conspiracy bare in heart cursed officious malignity of reginald talbot who have set to work on so unpleasant task be plain that young gentleman knew how be to end lay back in chair tapping boot with cane with grin on face such a cheshire cat might wear who feel mouse well under claw to mr wallis seemed equally clear that mr frank dennis also knew sat very pale quiet with face expectant of ill now then stole glance at margaret full of ineffable shame sorrow a for looked neither to right to left always at door ear be on stretch for william henry return from moment that departing footstep died away in face alone be to be seen unshaken confidence woman faithso often wasted a mr wallis thought to upon false worthless object presently mr erin glanced at seeming to gather comfort from calmness observed be sorry to detain mr wallis think better for sake that must remain here till matter have one way be settled will convince at event that there be collusion very proper arrangement sir one doe infinite credit returned other courteously one word from son friendthat be if a believe must need give up casewill be be necessary so that will not have to wait long gentleman may not be at home suggested margaret true answered mr wallis with bow in heart thought that gentleman be not at likely to be at home there be nothing in tone implied perhaps said mr erin in order to pas time must like to examine other shakespearean document in possession there be world of significance have other only known in manner in antiquary thus expressed idea of looking at treasure in order to pas time must hour ago have seemed to little short of blasphemy a please sir returned mr wallis indifferently though will pardon for saying that if note of hand turn out to be unauthentic will destroy credibility of rest will affect doubt admitted antiquary on other hand observed margaret in clear tone if evidence must be other way will proportionately strengthen claim illustration very cheerless proceeding undoubtedly replied mr wallis must offer that modicum of encouragement with perfect safety be well pleased to have opportunity of doing so believe young lady went on with earnest gentleness that must give sincerest gratification to find confidence justified by result then sat down indifferent eyed with pretence of interest to profession that mr erin have spread out upon table be cheerless proceeding very exhibitor be plain have little heart for performance instead of expatiating with unction might well have be called extreme on precious revelation only put in word two if have apprehension such a have never before experienced of visitor criticism be however unfounded mr wallis perhaps did not think while to make objection since few more minute at most must need see imposture out must have be like quarrelling with man upon deathbed even allowed that document be interesting though a made observation to margaret not to uncle be probable that rather expressed wish to please than real sentiment position be somewhat similar to of eloise when taking veil yet then to dread altar a drew not on cross eye be fixed not grace zeal love only be call for though of course old lawyer be not in love with margaret have much greater admiration for than for sacred relic still in spite of habit induced to give considerable attention to document even if be forgery be curious at event anything be better than sitting with hand before watching uncomfortable face that of mr samuel erin be at present particularly so for visitor eye be travelling towards leaffee tree weak point felt under circumstance in very ill condition to defend when suddenly there be knock at door there be willie cried margaret starting to foot felt assured since so short time have elapsed that have found friend of temple at home be news have brought with one glance at young fellow a entered room be sufficient for be good news eye of love be auger can pierce heart if not soul to other member of party william henry face told nothing did not indeed wear expression of defeat still le did exhibit triumph exultation have same quiet almost indifferent air that habitually wore when shakespearean discovery be under discussion pallor anxiety have caused in when left house upon apparently hopeless errand be gone with quiet smile drew forth paper from pocket handed to mr wallis be quite right sir said yet have not put friend in wrong be case of chameleon what be asked mr wallis question having unfolded paper proceeded to answer in tone of greatest amazement why be john hemynge over againthe real john hemynge yet suppose not more real than other said william henry quietly simple explanation be that there be two of two of exclaimed mr erin looking much like gay french mousquetaire only not gay when saw ghost of victim on one side of bed twin sister in flesh on other paper see be account of theatrical disbursement observed mr wallis biting lip in much perplexity that reminds that note of hand be upon similar subject dont mean to tell that hemynges be not only of same name of same callingactors tell nothing sir of own knowledge answered william henry drily for know nothing about matter went to patron with story bade tell that possessed authentic signature of shakespeare friend hemynge that be altogether different from one appended to note of hand have found in keeping that therefore latter be forgery only smiled said how very like commentator then opened little chest filled with theatrical memoranda there be nothing here of much value said for have examined a happens there be something to put gentleman mind at rest a to question of fraud then gave paper signature of bade to ask to compare with on mortgage deed be identical be not certainly appears to be so admitted mr wallis well according to patron account there be in shakespeare time two john hemynges oneyour john hemyngeconnected with shakespeare own theatre globe other whose receipt be appended to note of hand manager of curtain theatre former seems be called tall john hemynge latter short if care to know more about be instructed to say that friend be prepared to give information a eye fell upon lawyer chap fallen face william henry must not deny smile of triumph a regarded uncle margaret mr wallis observed that young fellow did not so much a even glance at thema circumstance lawyer attributed to very natural cause be not who have doubted of good faith so that in case have nothing to exult over felt very much abashed disconcerted be embarrassment decreased when margaret thus addressed will not forget mr wallis said gravely what be said just now of change must take place in opinion of in case matter must not turn out so unfavourably a expected nay pardon young lady returned lawyer gallantly have never harboured opinion of otherwise than favourable observation referred to other document indeed frankly confess be now prepared to consider in much le prejudiced light for present must take leave in meantime let express thanks to mr erin for kind reception have met with to withdraw without reserve expression may have let fall may be construed into reflection upon good faith upon of member of family for moment occurred to mr erin that here be opportunity for snatching ally from enemy camp by getting mr albany wallis to add name to list of believer on whole decided not to do so upon ground of danger of experiment if miss margaret slade however have asked mr wallis favour be doubtful whether must not have acceded to request felt brute at having given distress of mind by unmannerly suspicion that must have made almost sacrifice in reparation of retired with profusion of bow excuse while mr reginald talbot followed in silence at heel like whipped dog who professing to find hare in form have only found mare nest chapter xviii happens will love willie be not till visitor have gone that host seemed to become fully conscious of gravity of errand while mind be clouded with doubt be impossible for to entertain emotion very acutely now that accusation of literary lawyer have be shown to be groundless mr erin became at once alive to great wickedness impertinence man must have be madstark staring mad exclaimed to have come here upon ground of trumpery deed of to have made such abominable imputation know that malone be burning to see manuscript though have not honesty to confess must not wonder if have sent that fellow here a spy nay be sure mr wallis be spy said margaret well at event instead of reporting be barren a be hoped continued antiquary will have to speak of milk honey upon life believe must have got to sign profession of faith if have only pressed for by nature however warped by evil communication struck a honest man not only honest kind uncle observed margaret gently be very civil to noticed returned uncle grimly be sure must have got to sign what thorn must have be in scoundrel side if one of lieutenant must have be seduced so far from allegiance when mr erin said that scoundrel always meant malone be not necessary for himas in case of gentleman who have married three time be wont to observe when say wife mean first wifeto explain whom meant dont blame mr wallis at said margaret came upon disagreeable errand in interest of truth have frankly acknowledged to be in wrong person do feel indignant against be that horrid mr talbot man of letter a called remarked mr erin contemptuously never even asked to look at manuscript dont believe can read what do think of young friend now inquired turning to william henry well sir think have made fool of know be much too good natured willie observed margaret indignantly be sure frank agree with that mr talbot conduct have be most treacherous malignant dennis have not opened lip since william henry return have watched for with at least a much anxiety a rest refutation of what have be alleged seemed to have given rather relief than satisfaction be too good fellow to wish disgrace to happen even to rival a margaret read behaviour must hardly exult in rival victory must result in mr erin having greater confidence in young fellow than ever consequently in bettering of chance of gaining cousin hand yes said dennis quietly william henry have made great mistake of allowing irishman of low type to be on familiar term with men of nation when be of sterling nature be among best a be undoubtedly among most agreeable men in world there be great many counterfeitsmen who like talbot under mask of bonhomie conceal morose malignant disposition belong in fact to same class of fellow countryman who shoot men from behind hedge quite true observed mr erin approvingly have never heard that type of manto malone for one belongsso graphically described do hope willie will have nothing more to do with said margaret earnestly may depend upon will have nothing more to do with answered young fellow laughing already know what thought of verse indeed be telling honest opinion of have so set against now know what think of well said lad said antiquary rubbing hand smiling with consciousness of triumph one need not fear malice when be conscious of ill doing on own part good dennis look so exceedingly glum that if one didnt know one must think that have not that cause for confidence a regard what be just talking of irish gentleman observed dennis sententiously have confidence in at there be always reason to fear man who carry knife under waistcoat pooh pooh dennis take such sombre view of everything at event put in margaret gently frank be not alarmed upon own account gad thats true observed antiquary drily take care to let know that matter be concern of if wonderful discovery have be vouchsafed to last few month must turn out to be so much waste paper dont think must sleep wink worse for dennis coloured to temple said nothing perhaps be conscious of shortcoming in shakespearean enthusiasm be aware that have not shown much exultation over recent rout of enemy margaret thought might have said word two in self defence what deemed to be cause of silencenamely that whole subject of discovery be
