only something not quite satisfactorily explained made distrust own judgment back loser be great temptation to captain walter lisgard of th light dragoon to shew horse wise put from manfully rather with strength of mind far beyond of most men of class pastern seem to be long strong enough answered foot too large too small just what lord say observed trainer in same low tone can make see that there be degree of contraction be not horse so tell look now be not so be so at least seemed to be so to captain a trainer returned faulty member to proprietor with air of banker declining forged cheque be of small consequence to said walter will be sorry if winner doe not come out of stable took thousand to twenty in october can now hedge to great advantage if take advice will hold on said mr chifney confidentially twenty pound be little to lose have shewn by mean destroys chance moreover king will not be deposed in betting will be surprised if in paddock lay more than three to one be going to tell something mr chifney only thought better of said captain lisgard laying finger upon other coat cuff a emerged from royal presence yet trusted when be boy at school never abused confidence what fellow be to read chap returned trainer admiringly burst button be cunning one master walter be true be thinking of letting into little secret though after may be worth much let come on to tan gallop for five minute for nowhere else can get out of earshot of boy with passing through paddock provided with straw ride so that race horse need not set foot upon frost bound turf a issued forth to exercise mr chifney led way to upland where broad brown road of tan be permanently laid on level down here trainer paused speaking aloud for first time observed in solemn tone now look

of truculent red beard upon occasion somewhat sullen even defiant walter recognised in stranger stopping at lisgard arm at once be at loss to account for displeasure have doubtless received hint that presence at abbey must not be welcome good morning mr derrick returned captain cheerfully there be pride about since unfortunately have nothing to be proud of if there be why must not return civil reply to civil speech oh because ai good enough to speak to answered other scornfully because ai gentleman forsooth like high mighty family fact be sir although have got decent blood in vein come from country where care snapped finger with noise equal to crack of whip for who be man father unless man be worth salt that then must have be reason why good for nothing ruffian left that country thought captain answered with humility then fear must be giving up best chance if went there well answered stranger somewhat mollified speak like one of beastly aristocrat that will say a though be too much trouble to open darned lip mr derrick did not speak like aristocrat voice though rich in song have in speech strong northern burr rescued from such imputation why if man in country continued must venture to warn off land unless of course be mining claim a sir richard lisgard mr derrick interrupted captain firmly be sure that be not custom in country in world to abuse man brother to face having said that much will add that if have received rudeness from one at abbey be sincerely sorry for did not emanate from mr chifney here will give character so far master walter be a civil spoken well behaved young gentleman a in county exclaimed trainer warmly will go bail have never given man offence have just stepped in like to see 'the crack on have little money since be not one of who say 'it

be desirous of paying call than do that honour just at present be stable doe not look quite such likely horse a king master walter doe there be bone for ounce of blood be worth pound of bone say proverb remarked captain so far a go although be frenchman answered trainer have godolphin blood in vein only look at ragged hip ragged enough mr chifney do mean to say that animal will be public favourite hope not returned trainer winking facetiously at bearded friend will tell what do hope mr derrick will tell quoth other impulsively for say young gentleman be safe have taken sort of unaccountable fancy to hope more than believe captain lisgard that same ragged hipped horse will win derby two hundred to one against mr blanquette menelaus murmured walter pathetically a though be line from poem of affection be present quotation answered mr derrick with chuckle rattling quantity of loose silver gold in breech pocket perhaps must like to lay in pony with mr chifney mr derrick must like to thank very much for letting into secret assure will never pas lip held out hand to stranger way lie together a far a inn returned other warmly will liquor there forgot be longer in
