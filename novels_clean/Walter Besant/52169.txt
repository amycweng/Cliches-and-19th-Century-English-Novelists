inner house by walter besant author of world went very well then for faith freedom sort condition of men herr etc new york harper brother franklin square inner house prologue at royal institution professor cried director rushing to meet guest lecturer a door be thrown open great man appeared calm composed a if there be nothing more in wind than ordinary scientific discourse be always welcome friend always welcome two enthusiast for science wrung hand never more welcome than to night then great mystery be to be solved at last theatre be crammed with people what doe mean must tell before go in physicist smiled came to conviction be on true line five year ago said be only within last six month have demonstrated thing to certainty will tell friend whispered before go in then advanced shook hand with president whatever importance of discovery professor said president be fully sensible of honor have done in bringing before english audience first of especially before audience of royal institution ja ja herr president give discovery to world at same hour a for announce to very good friend of royal institution why not to other very good friend of royal society because be thing belongs to whole world not to scientific men only be in library of royal institution president council of institution be gathered together to receive illustrious lecturer face be touched with interrogation anxiety what be great discovery for six month there have appeared from time to time mysterious telegram in paper connected with industrious professor laboratory nothing definite nothing certain be whispered that new discovery soon about to be announced must entirely change relation of man to man of nation to nation who professed to be in secret suggested that might alter government abolish law why said that know not because certainly nobody be admitted to laboratory professor have confidant big headed man with enormous bald forehead big glass on fat nose be long broad a well a fat kept own counsel yet in way people be perfectly certain that something wonderful be coming so when roger bacon made gunpowder monk might have whispered to other only from smell came through key hole now devil must at last be met upon own ground telegram be continued with exasperating pertinacity until over whole civilized world eye of who loved science be turned upon modest laboratory in little university of ganzweltweisst be rhein what be coming from one doe not go so far a to say that interest in contemporary business politics art letter ceased be quite certain that morning evening when everybody opened paper first thought be to look for news from ganzweltweisst be rhein day passed by news came be especially hard on leader writer who be one waiting man longing to have cut in with subject before anybody else got be good for people who write letter to paper because have so many opportunity of suggestion surmise so leader writer got something to talk about after for suggested that prof schwarzbaum have found out way to make food artificially by chemically compounding nitrogen phosphate so forth philosopher built magnificent palace of imagination in dwelt glorified mankind no longer occupied in endless toil for sake of providing meat drink for family engaged in pursuit of knowledge in art of kind such a fiction poetry painting music acting so forth getting out of life such wealth of emotion pleasure culture a world have never before imagined others there be who thought that great discovery might be method of instantaneous transmission of matter from place to place so that a by electric wire one can send message so by kind of electric method one must send human body from one part of world to other in moment suggestion offered fine field for imagination there be novel written on subject have great success until discovery be announced others again thought that new discovery meant great wonderful development of destructive art so that whole of army might be blown into countless fragment by touch of button discharge of spring fall of hammer took fancy hugely be pleasant to read imaginary development of history a influenced by discovery seemed certain that learned professor must keep for use of own country so that there be longer room to doubt that if be nature of discovery whole of habitable world must inevitably fall under teutonic yoke empire of armed peace must set in like of have never before be witnessed upon globe on whole prospect be received everywhere except in france russia with resignation even united state remembered that have already many million of german among that new empire though must give certainly place to german must also save great many election therefore good deal of trouble must relieve national conscience long grievously oppressed in particular of truckling to irish vote dynamiter anarchist however be despondent socialist regarded other with ever deepening gloom particular theory of great discovery met in fact with universal credence over whole civilized globe from great man there came sign enterprising interviewer failed to get speech with scientific men wrote to got real information in reply mind of men grew more more agitated great change be considered certain what one morning be morning of thursday june there appeared advertisement in paper by telegram be discovered that similar advertisement have be published in great city over world of london paper differed from others in one important respect in namely professor schwarzbaum must without delay read before london audience paper must reveal new discovery there be not however least hint in announcement of nature of discovery yes said physicist speaking slowly have given particular to friend over whole earth a london be still centre of world resolved must myself communicate to english what be what be asked president discovery professor continued be to be announced at same moment over world so none of newspaper will have unfair start be now close upon nine o'clock by london time in paris be ten minute past nine in berlin be six minute before ten at st petersburg be eleven o'clock at new york be four o'clock in afternoon very good when clock in theatre point to nine exactly at moment everywhere same paper will be read in fact at moment clock began to strike president led way to theatre followed by council director remained behind with lecturer of evening friend said professor schwarzbaum subject be nothing laid finger upon director arm nothing le than 'the prolongation of vital energy ' what prolongation of vital energy do know what mean director turned pale be to understand come said professor must not waste time then director startled pale took german brother by arm led into theatre murmuring prolongation prolongation prolongation of vital vital energy theatre be crowded there be not vacant seat there be more standing room on stair very door of gallery be thronged great staircase be thronged with who must not get in waited to get first news nay outside institution albemarle street be crowded with people waiting to hear what great thing might be world have waited six month to hear within theatre what audience for first time in english history respect at have be paid to rank people gathered in theatre be that great city must boast be distinguished in science art letter present be men who moved world among naturally sprinkling of men who be born to best thing of world be sometimes told that help to move there be lady among company too lady well known in scientific literary circle with certain great lady led by curiosity on left hand side of theatre for instance close to door sat two very great lady indeed one of countess of thordis other only daughter lady mildred carera leaning against pillar beside stood young man of singularly handsome appearance tall commanding of stature to dr linister said countess suppose everything that professor have to tell will be already well known said dr linister must be too much to expect for ladyship went on delicately love to catch science on wing on wing in lighter mood when have something really popular to tell dr linister bowed then eye met of beautiful girl sitting below leaned whispered looked for everywhere last night have led to understand went nowhere after mamma fancied have bad cold then evening may be quite quite sure voice dropped finger met hers beneath fan drew away quickly with blush yes whispered may find to night at lady chatterton lady ingleby from can understand that young dr linister be quite man in society be young have already great reputation for biological research be only son of fashionable physician must be very rich therefore in season harry linister be of season on most of face present there sat expression of anxiety even fear what be new thing be world really going to be turned upside down when west end be so very comfortable position so very well assured there be few present who rubbed hand at thought of great upturn of everything up with scum first when have be ladled overboard new arrangement must be possible to advantage of who rubbed hand when clock struck nine dead silence fell upon theatre not breath be heard not cough not rustle of dress face be pale with lip be parted very breathing seemed arrested then president council walked in took place lady gentleman said president shortly learned professor will communicate to subject title of paper may be certain beforehand that subject matter will adorn motto of society illustrous commoda vit then dr schwarzbaum stood at table before looked round room lady mildred glanced at young man harry linister be staring at german like rest speechless sighed woman did not in day like love making to be forgotten interrupted by anything certainly not by science learned german carried small bundle of paper laid on table carefully slowly adjusted spectacle then drew from pocket small leather case then looked round room smiled be to say lip be covered with full beard so that sweetness of smile be mostly lost be observed under behind beard mere ghost of smile yet benevolent ghost lecturer began somewhat in copy book fashion to remind audience that everything in nature be born grows slowly to maturity enjoys brief period of full force strength then decay finally dy tree of life be first green sapling last white leafless trunk expatiated at length on growth of young life pointed out that method have be discovered to hinder growth turn into unnatural form even to stop destroy altogether showed how body be gradually strengthened in part showed for unscientific hearer how various part of structure assume strength be familiar to most of audience next proceeded to dwell upon period of full maturity of bodily mental strength in man must last from twenty five to sixty even beyond time decay of bodily even of mental organ may have already set in even when mind body seem most vigorous at period of discussion most of audience be beginning to flag in attention be such gathering a assembled only to hear discussion on growth decay of faculty director who knew what be coming sat bolt upright expectant be strange people said afterwards that one must have suspected what be coming there be to be everybody knew great announcement be certain destruction locomotion food transmission of thought substitution of speech for writing thing a have be seen have be suggested one even guessed real nature of discovery now with exception of people who always pretend to have known along to have be favored with great man confidence to have guessed thing from outset one have least suspicion therefore when professor suddenly stopped short after prolix description of wasting power wearied organ held up admonitory finger everybody jumped because now secret be to be divulged have come to hear great secret what be decay asked what be why doe begin what law regulate what check can place upon how can prevent how can stay progress can science have done so much to make life happy have found out so many thing by man brief span be crowded with delightful emotion can science do more can not science add to gift more precious gift of lengthening of brief span here everybody gasped ask speaker went on whether science can not put off day close eye turn body into senseless lump consider be sooner arrived at goal of ambition than have to go away be sooner at plenitude of wisdom knowledge than have to lay down that have learned go away nay can not even transmit to others accumulation of knowledge be lost be sooner happy with love than have to leave collect can not enjoy inherit be for day learn have time to use learning love be for hour pas youth in hope manhood in effort die before be old be strong strength pass like dream be beautiful beauty perishes in single day can not ask again can not science prolong vital force stay destroying hand of decay at point wonderful passion seized upon many of people present for sprang to foot lifted hand shouted wept aloud clasped other by hand there be lover among crowd who fell openly into other arm there be men of learning who hugged imaginary book looked up with wild eye there be girl who smiled thinking that beauty might last longer than day there be woman down whose cheek rolled tear of sorrow for vanished beauty there be old men who heard trembled one of spoke out of crowd only one found word be old statesman old man eloquent rose with shaking limb sir cried voice still sonorous give back manhood professor continued regardless suppose said that science have found out way not to restore what be lost to arrest further loss not to give back what be gone might a well try to restore leg have be cut off to prevent further loss consider for moment pray who search into nature secret might if be done for carry on investigation far beyond point have yet be reached who cultivate art might attain to greater skill of hand truth of sight than have ever yet be seen who study human nature might multiply observation who love might have longer time for passion men who be strong might remain strong woman who be beautiful might remain beautiful sir cried again old man eloquent give back manhood lecturer made reply went on rich might have time sensible length of time in to enjoy wealth young might remain young old might grow older feeble might not become more feeble for prolonged time a for whose life must never become anything burden to to rest of world crippled criminal poor imbecile incompetent stupid frivolous must live out allotted life die must be for salt of earth for flower of mankind for men strong of intellect endowed above common herd science must reserve precious gift give back manhood cried again old man eloquent be not alone for sprang to foot together cried aloud shrieking weeping stretching forth hand give give give director who knew that what be asked for must be given sat silent self possessed speaker motioned to sit down again must not said limit great gift to alone whose intellect lead world must extend to who help to make life beautiful happy to lovely woman here men heaved sigh so deep so simultaneous that fell upon ear like voice of thanksgiving from cathedral choir to who love only empty show pleasure vainglory of life here many smiled especially of younger sort even to of who desire nothing of life love song dalliance laughter again younger sort smiled tried to look a if have connection at with band must extend gift repeat to who can be happy in sunshine light to who can make happiness of others then again consider when have enjoyed thing for while when life have be prolonged so that have enjoyed that desire in full measure running over when not two three year have passed perhaps two three century must then of own accord put aside aid of science suffer body to fall into decay awaits living matter contented resigned must sink into tomb not satiated with joy of life satisfied to have have share there must be terror in death since must take none who must say have have enough day must surely come to one there be nothing not research discovery not beauty of nature not love pleasure not art not flower sunshine perpetual youth of must not in time grow weary science can not alter law of nature of thing there must be end can prolong can avert can yes friend be discovery be gift to humanity be fruit outcome of life for great thing have be reserved science can arrest decay can make live live on live for century nay know not why not can if foolishly desire make live forever now when word be spoken there fell deep silence upon crowd one spoke one looked up be awed must not realize what meant must be given be suddenly relieved of great terror constant dread lie in man heart ever present though conceal dread of death must not in moment understand that be given director sprang to foot grasped brother physicist by hand of son of science said solemnly thou shalt be proclaimed first best assembly heard word made sign there be applause not murmur not voice be stricken dumb with wonder with awe be going to live to live on to live for century nay why not to live forever know professor continued how at dinner single glass of champagne revives spirit loos tongue brings activity to brain guest be weary be in decay champagne arrest that decay discovery be of kind of champagne act with more lasting effect strengthens nerve hardens muscle quickens blood brings activity to digestion with new strength of body return new strength to mind mind body be one paused moment then gave leather case into hand of director be gift say give to brother full particular history of invention seek profit for myself be own day new epoch begin for humanity will not die live accident fire lightning may kill against thing can not guard old age will no more fall upon decay will no more rob of life strength death will be voluntary be great change know not if have done aright be for to determine see that use gift aright then before people have understood last word speaker stepped out of theatre be gone director of royal institution stood in place in hand be leather case containing gift of life countess of thordis who have be asleep throughout lecture woke up when be finished how deeply interesting sighed be to catch science on wing then looked round mildred dear said have dr linister gone to find carriage dear what commotion at royal institution of place in world think mamma said lady mildred coldly that have better get one else to find carriage dr linister be over there be better engaged be be among brother physicist be eagerly asking question crowding round director theatre seemed filled with mad people who surged crowded pushed come mamma said lady mildred pale with red spot on cheek will leave to fight out science have beaten love did not meet harry linister again that night when met again long year afterwards passed by with eye showed have clean forgotten existence unaltered though be in face form chapter supper bell when big bell in tower of house of life struck hour of seven other bell began to chime a have done day at hour for know not how many year very likely in library where still keep great collection of perfectly useless book there be preserved history may speak of bell of builder of house when chime began swift jackdaw live in tower began to fly about with great show of hurry a if there be barely time for supper though a be yet only month of july sun must not be setting for hour more have long since ceased to preach to people otherwise might make learn great deal from animal world live for instance from day to day not only be life miserably short be always hungry always fighting always quarrelling always fierce in love jealousy watching swift for instance may do nearly day long ought to congratulate ourselves on own leisurely order adequate provision for food made by wisdom of college assurance of preservation also established by wisdom freedom from haste anxiety a from emotion of love hatred jealousy rivalry time have gone by for kind of exhortation thus people who at hour crowded great square showed in face attitude movement calm reigned in soul be lying on grass be sitting on bench be strolling be for most part alone if not alone because habit often survives when original cause of habit be gone then in pair in old unhappy day there must have be restless activity hurrying to fro there must have be laughter talking everybody must have be talking there must have be young men eagerly courting favor of young woman looking on with longing eye ready to fight for for girl loved thinking of girl loved a of goddess angel perfection girl ardently desired foolish worship again formerly there must have be old men old woman looking with melancholy eye on scene be about to quit lamenting day of strength youth formerly there must have be among crowd beggar pauper there must have be master servant noble bourgeois there must have be conceivable difference in age rank strength intellect distinction again formerly there must have be most insolent difference in costume of men used to wear broadcloth sleek smooth with glossy hat glove flower at button hole while beside crawled wretched half clad object pretending to sell match in reality begging for bread of woman used to flaunt in dainty expensive stuff setting off supposed charm be mostly made by dress maker art with curve color of drapery beside must be crawling wretched creature to whom in summer when day be hot fine park be only home rusty black only wear now activity at hurrying laughing not even talking that might have struck visitor a one of most remarkable result of system foolish talking a for dress be alike men wore blue flannel jacket trouser with flannel shirt flat blue cap for working hour have rougher dress woman wore costume in gray made of stuff called beige be useful stuff because wear well be soft yet warm can not be objected to by of on score of ugliness what mutiny what secret conspiracy what mad revolt have to be faced before woman must be made to understand socialism only form of society can now be accepted must be logical complete what be one woman more than that must separate from sister by dress therefore since subjugation wear gray beige frock with jacket of same flat gray cap like men under be made to gather up hair scene indeed gathering of people before supper bell be one of never tire look at eager hurrying swift in air remember past think of present when gaze upon great multitude in one regardeth neighbor none speaks to none there be individual aim be pure unadulterated socialism with not far distant ultimate triumph of science desire to relate exact circumstance connected with certain recent event be generally known that caused one deplorable death one of own society although not physician of house will have to explain before begin narrative certain point in internal management may differ from custom adopted elsewhere of later era visit other so seldom that difference may easily grow up indeed considering terrible danger of travel how if one walk there be peril of unfiltered water damp bed sprained ankle byrsitis of knee chill from frost shower if one get into wheeled vehicle wheel may fall off carriage may be overturned in ditch why pursue subject repeat therefore must speak of community order that a briefly a may be rebel have be driven forth from pale of humanity to wander where please in few year will be released if have not already happened by death from disease suffering will fall upon then will remember more century will roll by will be forgotten very mound of earth once marked place of burial will be level with ground around house glory of house will continue thus perish enemy of science city of canterbury a be rebuilt when socialism be finally established have in centre great square park garden central breathing place relaxation ground of city side be exactly mile in length garden thus occupying area of fourth of square mile be planted with kind of ornamental tree laid out in flower bed winding walk serpentine river lake cascade bridge grotto summer house lawn everything can help to make place attractive during summer be thronged evening with people on west side have be erected enormous palace of glass low in height stretching far away to west covering immense area here heat be artificially maintained at temperature varying with season plant be in cultivation in winter frost bad weather in rain form place of recreation rest here grow kind of fruit tree with kind of vegetable flower plant year round furnishes in quantity sufficient for want endless supply of fruit so that have supply of during whole year a grape banana orange others for at least year a peach strawberry so forth while of commoner vegetable a pea bean like there be now season be grown continuously in old time be dependent upon change chance of capricious variable climate now not only have erection of vast house made independent of summer winter placing of much grass corn land under glass have also assured crop secured from danger of famine be by mean one of least advantage of modern civilization on south side of square stand public building have not like house of life architectural beauty why must aim at beauty when efficiency be sole object house of life be designed erected when men thought perpetually of beauty working from admiration of beauty in woman in nature to beauty in thing made with own hand setting beauty above usefulness even thinking necessary when usefulness have be attained to add adornment a when added tower to house of life yet did nothing with tower did not want public hall be built of red brick resembles row of house with gable to street there be for broad plain door with simple porch below above broad plain window twenty foot wide divided into four compartment division whole set in framework of wood appearance of hall be therefore remarkably plain there be thirty one of gable forty foot wide so that whole length of hall be twelve hundred forty foot nearly quarter of mile within roof of of gable cover hall separated from neighbor by plain column be alike except that middle hall set apart for college have gallery originally intended for orchestra now never used in central hall one table alone be placed in others there be four hall accommodating eight hundred people table two hundred length of hall be same namely two hundred fifty foot hall be lit by one large window at end there be carving sculpture other ornament in building at back be extensive range of building of brick built in small compartment fire proof contain kitchen granary abattoir larder cellar dairy still room pantry curing house oven brewery other office chamber required for daily provisioning of city with twenty four thousand inhabitant on east side of square there be two great group of building nearest to public hall contains in series of building communicate with one library museum armory model room picture gallery last be building a old a house be when event began open to whole community though be never visited by even out of idle curiosity inquisitive spirit be dead for be not anxious to see people acquire revive habit of reading inquiring might be argued that study of history might make contrast present with past shudder at lot of forefather be going to show that study may produce opposite effect there be study of science how must help people have college always studying investigating for benefit secret of medical science alone concern happiness might learn how to make machine machinery requires steam explosive electricity other uncontrolled dangerous force many thousand of life be formerly lost in making management of machine do very well without might be true read book tell of people in former time why read work be filled with presence of death shortness of life intensity of passion have almost forgotten will see what come of study seem so innocent say therefore never have wish to see people flocking into library for same reason that study contemplation of thing past might unsettle disturb tranquillity of mind have never wished to see in museum armory other part of collection since event of have to tell have enclosed building added to college so that people can no longer enter even if wished curator of museum be aged man one of few old men left in old day have held title of kind be placed there because be old much broken must do work therefore be told to keep glass case free from dust to sweep floor morning at time of great discovery have be earl viscount know not what by accident escaped great slaughter when be resolved to kill old men woman in order to reduce population to number land must support believe that hid be secretly fed by man who have formerly be groom still preserved remains of what called attachment duty until such time a execution be over then ventured forth again so great be horror of recent massacre with recollection of prayer shriek of victim that be allowed to continue alive old man be troubled with asthma hardly permitted hour of repose be incurable must have made life intolerable except to live only to live in pain misery be always better than to die for last few year old man have companion in museum be girl only girl in community who called know not why perhaps because relationship really existed grandfather lived with be who dusted case swept floor found mean of relieving old man asthma day long must that have discovered fact suspected whither must lead wretched girl read book of library studied content of case talked to old man making tell everything belonged to past cared for be past that studied be to understand more more how men lived then what thought what talked be about eighteen year of age indeed thought still child know not how many year have elapsed since in city be child because be vain thing to keep account of year if anything happens to distinguish must be something disastrous because have now arrived almost at last stage possible to man only remains for to discover not only how to prevent disease how to annihilate since then there be only one step left to take in advance other event can happen must be in nature of calamity therefore may be forgotten have said that christine called old man grandfather have long long since agreed to forget old tie of blood how can father son mother daughter brother sister continue for hundred of year when remain fixed at same age to keep up old relationship maternal love dy out with be now seldom called into existence when child can run about why not animal from whom learn so much desert offspring when can feed mother cease to care for child when be old enough to be charge of community therefore christine mother cheerfully suffered child to leave a soon a be old enough to sit in public hall grandfather if indeed be grandfather obtained permission to have child with so remained in quiet museum never imagined suspected however that old man who be eighty at time of great discovery remembered everything that took place when be young talked with girl day long about past know who be christine father matter not now indeed never claimed daughter one smile to think of importance formerly attached to father no longer work for support be no longer dependent upon assistance father doe nothing for son son for father five hundred year ago say thousand year ago father carried baby in arm what then own father believe be own father on point may be mistaken saw yesterday taking turn in hay field seemed distressed with heat fatigue of why not make difference to be though not so young still a strong a able bodied a christine be called into existence by sanction of college when one of community be struck dead by lightning be brother believe terrible event filled with consternation however population having thus be diminished by one be resolved that loss must be repaired there be precedent great many year previously owing to man being killed by fall of hay rick hay rick be now made low birth have be allowed that be boy let now return to square on same side be building of college here be anatomical collection storehouse of materia medica residence of arch physician suffragan fellow of college associate physician assistant experimenter building be plain fire proof college have own private garden be large filled with tree here physician walk meditate undisturbed by outer world here be also library on north side of square stand great venerable house of life glory of city pride of whole country be very ancient formerly there be many such splendid monument standing in country now alone remains be built in dim distant age when men believed thing now forgotten be designed for celebration of certain ceremony function nature meaning may dare say be ascertained by who care to waste time in inquiry so useless edifice must not possibly be built in time first because have artificer capable of rearing such pile next because have not among one capable of conceiving drawing design of nay have none who must execute carved stone work say with humility with satisfaction for if contemplate building must acknowledge that though be a have said glory of city though be vast in proportion imposing by grandeur splendid in work yet most of be perfectly useless what need of tall column to support roof might very well have be one fourth present height why build tower at what be good of carved work of new era build in brick be fire proof put up structure be larger than be wanted waste labor because grudge time must be spent in necessary work over thing unnecessary besides be no longer tortured by feverish anxiety to do something anything by may be remembered when short span of life be past death to be thing may happen by accident not from old age by disease why must men toil trouble in order to be remembered thing be equal why must one man try to do something better than what can not do what be useless when be done sculpture picture art of kind will not add single ear of corn to general stock single glass of wine yard of flannel therefore need not regret decay of art a everybody know however house be chief laboratory of whole country be here that great secret be preserved be known to arch physician to suffragan alone other man in country know by what process be compounded that potent liquid arrest decay prolongs life apparently without bound limit say without bound limit there certainly be croaker who maintain that at future time may be very year may be thousand year hence compound will lose power so of even college must then inevitably begin to decay after few short year perish sink into silent grave very thought cause horror too dreadful for word limb tremble teeth chatter others declare that there be fear whatever of result that only dread be lest whole college must suddenly be struck by lightning so secret be lost for though none other than arch physician suffragan know secret whole society fellow assistant physician know in what strong place secret be kept in writing just a be communicated by discoverer fellow of college assist in production of precious liquid be made only in house of life none of know whether be working for great arcanum on of many experiment conducted for arch physician even if one guessed must not dare to communicate suspicion even to brother fellow being forbidden under most awful of penalty that of death to divulge experiment process that be ordered to carry out be needle to say that if be proud of house be equally proud of city there be formerly old canterbury of picture exist in library street of town be narrow winding house be irregular in height size style there be close court not six foot broad in air must circulate where fever other disorder be bred house again stood in stately garden while others have none at owner of garden kept closed can easily understand what might have happened when private property be recognized law protected so called right of owner now that there be property there be law there be also crime because there be incentive to jealousy rapine double dealing where there be crime there be condition of innocence ancestor so eagerly desired sought by mean be perfectly certain to fail how different be canterbury of present first like modern town be limited in size there be in twenty four thousand inhabitant more le round great central square garden be public building street branch off at right angle be of same width same length same appearance be planted with tree house be built of red brick house containing four room on ground floor namely two on side door four on first floor with bath room room be vaulted with brick so that there be fear of fire room have own occupant a room be of same size be furnished in same way with same regard to comfort warmth there be really ground for complaint jealousy occupant also who have same meal in same hall day can not complain of inequality more than can accuse other of gluttonous living in matter of clothes again be at first expected that grave difficulty with woman a to uniformity of fashion of material must continue to trouble with decay of emotion formerly caused so much trouble since men have ceased to court woman woman have ceased to desire men admiration there have be opposition of now be clad alike gray be found most convenient color soft beige most convenient material same beautiful equality rule hour method of work five hour day be found ample everybody take time at kind of work men work being kept separate from given to woman confess that work be not performed with a much zeal a one must wish think of old time when one have to work eight ten even eighteen hour day in order to earn poor miserable subsistence what zeal must have put into work how different be glorious equality in thing from ancient anomaly injustice of class rank wealth poverty why formerly chief pursuit of man be pursuit of money now there be money at wealth lie in barn garner must be forgiven if dwell upon contrast history have to be told how attempt be actually made to destroy eden to substitute in place old condition of thing fill with such indignation that be constrained to speak consider for one other thing former condition of world be filled with disease people be not in way protected be allowed to live a pleased consequently committed excess contracted disease drank too much ate too much took exercise took too little lay in bed too long went to bed too late suffered to fall into violent rage into remorse into despair loved inordinately thousand worked too hard ran after jack o ' lantern continually for before one there be dangled hope of promotion before that of glory before that of distinction fame praise before that of wealth before chance of retiring to rest meditate during brief remainder of life miserably short even in whole length then disease fell upon died have now prevented new disease though can not wholly cure have so long existed rheumatism gout fever arise more though of gout other malady there be hereditary case since there be no longer old men among there be none of malady to old age be liable no more pain more suffering more anxiety no more death except by accident in world yet of must return to old misery for what for what will hear when chime began people turned face with one consent towards public hall smile of satisfaction spread over face be going to supper principal event of day at same moment procession issued from iron gate of college first marched warder porter john lax bearing halberd next came assistant carrying cushion on be key of gold symbolical of gate of life then came bearing banner with labarum symbol of life assistant followed in ancient garb of cap gown then came twelve fellow physician of college in scarlet gown flat fur lined cap after samuel grout md suffragan followed last there marched first person in realm none other than arch physician dr henry linister in lawn sleeve black silk gown scarlet hood four beadle closed procession for with only deviation from equality absolute be made in case of college be caste apart keep mankind alive free from pain be work occupies thought be therefore held in honor excused ordinary work others must daily perform behold difference between ancient modern time for formerly who be held in honor have high office in always sacred house be aged white haired men who arrived at distinction year two before have to die of holy college be a stalwart a strong a young a man in hall so have be for hundred of year so mean to continue in public hall take meal apart in own hall yet food be same for life be common possession be maintained for by same process here must be difference let therefore eat drink alike when consider repeat universal happiness be carried away first with burning indignation that must be so mad a to mar happiness have failed cost a will hear much trouble caused lamentable death of most zealous able officer among last to enter gate be girl christine grandfather who walked slowly coughing way come grandad said a passed take arm will be better after dinner lean on there be in face so remarkable light wonder now that suspicion distrust possessed call light for can compare to nothing else easy comfortable life people led absence of exciting work decay of reading abandonment of art have left face placid to look upon dull be certainly dull moved heavily if lifted eye wanted light flashed from christine be childish face still full of softness one must ever believe that creature so slight in form so gentle to look upon whose eye be so soft whose cheek be like untouched bloom of ripe peach whose half parted lip be so rosy be already harboring thought so abominable already conceiving enterprise so wicked suspect in new world a have property to defend one be thief a everybody have a much of everything a want one try to get more fear not death therefore need religion have private ambition to gratify private end to attain therefore have long since ceased to be suspicious least of must have be suspicious of christine why year two ago be little newly born babe whom holy college crowded to see a new thing yet be possible that one so young must be so corrupt suffragan said arch physician to at supper begin to think that triumph of science must be really complete why physician because day after day that child lead old man by hand place in seat minister after old forgotten fashion to slightest want one pay slightest heed why must child beautiful child feeble old man one who minister to suffragan past be indeed far far away knew not until now that be so utterly lost childhood age office of love thing be wholly unheeded grout be indeed great man spoke in mocking tone be usual with so that never knew exactly whether be in earnest not think that on occasion be in earnest one very great man none smaller than samuel grout must have accomplished miracle upon mind of people did not minister one to other why must everybody must eat own ration without help office of love to pas unheeded what did arch physician mean chapter ii grout suffragan always plea from place at college table be raised two foot above rest to contemplate multitude whom be duty pleasure to keep in contentment in health be daily joy to watch flocking a have seen flock to meal heart glow to think of what have done see face of light up with satisfaction at prospect of food be only thing move have reduced life to simplest form here be true happiness nothing to hope nothing to fear except accident little work for common preservation body of wise men always devising measure for common good food plentiful varied garden for repose recreation summer winter warmth shelter entire absence of emotion why very face of people be growing alike one face for men for woman perhaps in far off future face of man will approach nearer nearer to of woman so will be at last exactly alike individual will exist indeed more then there will be from first to last among whole multitude distinction difference be face fill one with contentment though will be many century before approach completeness be smooth face there be line in be grave face lip seldom smile never laugh eye be heavy move slowly there have already be achieved though change have be very gradual complete banishment of expression have be preserved in one of ancient portrait may be usefully studied for purpose of contrast whatever emotion attempted to be portrayed even when face be supposed to be at rest there be always behind visible to eye expression of anxiety eagerness kind of pain always lie upon old face even upon youngest how must be otherwise on morrow must be dead have to crowd into few day must grasp of life a sit there watch people at dinner see with satisfaction that old pain have gone out of face have lived so long that have forgotten death live so easily that be contented with life have reduced existence to simplest eat drink be only pleasure work be necessity for health existence work take no longer than till noontide lie in sun sit in shade sleep if have once knowledge be now forgotten old ambition old desire be forgotten sleep eat work rest to rest to eat be pleasure never desire to end to live forever to eat drink forever be now only hope have be accomplished for by holy college science have justified be outcome of man long search for generation into secret of nature who have carried on search have at length succeeded in stripping humanity of thing formerly made existence intolerable to life eats sleep perhaps know not of sometimes talk in college say perhaps may succeed in making kind of artificial food a compound great arcanum with simple ingredient without labor may also extend duration of sleep may thus still further simplify existence man in end a propose to make mould people will sleep until nature call upon to awake eat will then eat drink sleep again while year roll by will lie heedless of will be heedless of season heedless of century time will have meaning for breathing living inarticulate mass will be be left of active eager chattering man of past may be done in future when yonder laboratory call house of life will yield secret of nature deeper deeper still at present have arrived at point chief pleasure of life be to eat to drink have taught people so much of taste formerly gratified man alone remains provide daily with sufficiency variety of food there be so many kind of food combination be so endless that practically choice of cook be unlimited good food varied food well cooked food with drink also varied pure best can be made make public meal daily joy have learned to make kind of wine from grape in hot house be so abundant that day year round people may call for ration of what please make also beer of kind cider perry mead gratification of sense of taste help to remove incentive to restlessness discontent mind of most be occupied by other thought than of last feast next if be to revolt where must find next meal at outset have confess grave difficulty there be not in existence holy college drifted without object purpose for long time old ambition remained old passion be continued old idea of private property prevailed old inequality be kept up presently there arose from who have property demand for more equal share cry be fiercely resisted then there followed civil war for space till side be horrified by bloodshed followed time also be on side of who rebelled be one because at time when whole nation be admitted to participation in great arcanum be young man of nineteen employed a washer of bottle in dr linister laboratory therefore according to idea of time very humble person time helped in unexpected way property be in hand of single individual formerly died be succeeded by son now son grew tired of waiting how much longer be father who grew older to keep wealth to therefore civil war having come to end with result except barren peace revolutionary party be presently joined by holder of property state took over to whole wealth be to say whole land there be other wealth since time there have be private property for since be clearly unjust to take away from father in order to give to son with limitation a to time of enjoyment everything followed land great house be allowed to fall into ruin picture work of art library jewel be in museum money however ceased to be of value a soon a there be nothing must be bought a for be so fortunate a to perceive dr linister daily impressed upon that of occupation that of physicist must very quickly become most important therefore remained in employment worked read experimented learned that master have to teach other profession indeed fell into decay more speedily than of expected there must be more lawyer when there be more property even libel be formerly cause of many action became harmless when man must not be injured besides be impossible to libel man when there be no longer rule of conduct except one duty of work be done in eye of can not be shirked how must religion survive removal of death to possible remote future tried be true to keep up pretence of many especially woman clung to old form of faith for know not how long with great mass religion ceased to have influence a soon a life be assured a for art learning science other than of physic biology medicine gradually decayed died away old foolish pursuit of literature once occupied so many be even held in kind of honor writing of history poem drama novel essay on human life also decayed died because men ceased to be anxious about past future be at last contented to dwell in present most important change may be noted be gradual decline disappearance of passion called love be once curious inexplicable yearning so much be certain of two young people towards other so that be never content unless be together longed to live apart from rest of world trying to make other happier at least be a read history for own part a be constantly occupied with science never felt passion if did then have quite forgotten now at outset people who be in love rejoiced beyond measure that happiness must last so long began so long a word have meaning to call other angel goddess divinely fair possessed of perfect gift with other extravagancy at mere recollection of must now blush presently grew tired of other no longer lived apart from rest of world separated if continued to walk together be from force of habit still continue thus to sit side by side new connection be formed people ceased desiring to make others happy because state began to provide for everybody happiness whole essence of old society be fight everybody fought for existence everybody trampled on weaker if man loved woman fought for a well a for love why when true principle of life be recognized right of individual to share that equal share in everything when continuance of life be assured what room be there for love very fact of public life constant companionship open mingling of woman with men for year after year same woman with same men have destroyed mystery formerly hung about womanhood be in principal cause of love be gone therefore with most disturbing element of life without love without ambition without suffering without religion without quarrelling without private right without rank class life be calm gentle undisturbed therefore sit down to dinner in peace contentment man mind intent upon nothing bill of fare evening directed by observation of arch physician turned eye upon girl christine who sat beside grandfather observed first fact inspired with suspicion that be no longer child woman grown began to wonder when must come with rest for arcanum most woman when birth be common among used to come at about five twenty be to say in first year two of full womanhood before worst enemy where there be two woman in old day there be two enemy must say that have begun to fall off if look round table will see very few woman older than twenty four very few men older than thirty there be many woman at table who might perhaps have be called beautiful in old time though now men have ceased to think of beauty woman have ceased to desire admiration yet if regular feature large eye small mouth great quantity of hair rounded figure be beautiful then there be many at table who might have be called beautiful girl christine observed fact with scientific interest be so different from other woman that seemed kind of creature eye be soft there be scientific term to express softness of youth one observes especially in young of cervus kind there be also curious softness on cheek a if something must be rubbed away if one touched voice differed from that of elder sister be curiously gentle full of quality may be remarked in wood dove when pair in spring used to call tenderness since thing disappeared word have naturally fallen out of use now might have observed with suspicion whereas only remarked a something strange that company among christine old man sat be curiously stirred uneasy be disturbed out of habitual tranquillity because girl be discoursing to be telling what have learned about past oh heard say be beautiful time why did ever suffer to perish do mean that actually remember nothing of looked at other sheepishly there be soldier men be soldier went out to fight with band of music shout of people there be whole army of soldier thousand of dressed in beautiful glittering clothes do forget that one of men murmured hazily that there be soldier there be sailor who went upon sea in great ship jack carera turned to one of be sailor too ought to remember remember sailor very well indeed said young man readily always have doubt about wisdom of admitting sailor among people have few ship for carriage of thing a yet have not succeeded in growing for be manned by few hundred sailor who long ago volunteered have gone on ever since be brave race ready to face most terrible danger of tempest shipwreck be also dangerous restless talkative questioning tribe have in fact preserved almost a much independence a college be now confined to own port of sheerness then girl began to tell pestilent story of love shipwreck rescue at hearing of looked puzzled pained sailor listened with ear where did get that from christine where get everything from old library come read in book jack be not much hand at reading day perhaps after next voyage christine girl poured out glass of claret for old man then went on telling story most of neighbor seemed to hear to comprehend only sailor man listened nodded then laughed out loud at sound so strange so unexpected everybody within hearing jumped table be in hall next to own so that heard laugh quite plainly arch physician looked round approvingly how many year since heard good honest young laugh suffragan give more child soften heart for heart want be hard crusted selfish heart see one asks why laughed be eating again now just a if nothing have happened happy enviable people presently turned to remarked in lofty manner a if be above world can not explain suffragan why at unexpected touch sound voice trifle memory may be suddenly awakened to thing long long past forgotten do know what that laugh caused to remember can not explain why can recalled evening of great discovery not discovery quite thing went there more to meet girl than to hear what german have to say a to that expected very little to meet that girl seemed of far more importance meant to make love to love suffragan thing can never understand real genuine love meant to marry well did meet arranged for convenient place where must meet again after lecture then came discovery be carried away body soul forgot girl love everything in stupefaction of most wonderful discovery of have made between such admirable use never knew whether arch physician be in earnest not truly have made most beautiful use of discovery be not in way that dr linister must have chosen remembered just because girl laughed suffragan science can not explain will never pretend to deny dr linister power a physicist be of first order that discovery warranted election to headship of college yet something be due perhaps to tall commanding figure to look of authority reigned naturally on face to way in always stepped into first rank be always chief long before college of physician assumed whole authority in everything that joined opposed extinction of property must have have everybody win what must keep a long a must opposed massacre of old be opposed in short to majority of college yet be chief voice be clear what said always produced effect though did not upset solid majority thwart grand advance of triumph of science a for position have be won by sheer work merit figure be not commanding be short sighted dark visaged voice be rough a for manner have nothing to do with in science there be one second to linister be grout when supper came to end rose marched back to college in same state order with have arrived a for people of went out into garden remained in hall be then nine o'clock twilight went straight to own room where must smoke tobacco old habit allowed by college on account of soothing sedative influence before going to bed by ten o'clock everybody must be in bed asleep what more beautiful proof of advance of science than fact that whole of twenty four thousand people who formed population of canterbury dropped off to sleep moment laid head upon pillow be to have learned proper quantity kind of food proper amount of bodily exercise work complete subjugation of ancient force of unrest disquiet to be sure be with one two exception in very prime flower of early manhood womanhood must be hard indeed if young man of thirty must not sleep well be presently joined in garden of college by arch physician grout said let sit talk mind be disturbed be always disturbed when memory of past be forced upon evil past said if please evil past question be whether be not infinitely more tolerable for mankind than evil present argued out point be one on must never agree for remained saturated with old idea of private property individualism maintained that there be right of man at except right to what can get what can keep even went so far a to say that true use of great discovery must have be to cause incompetent idle hereditarily corrupt vicious to die painlessly a to who be left said must have taught selfishness of staying too long when have taken time for work play society love must have be exhorted to go away of own accord to make room for child then must have have always due succession of father son mother daughter always age manhood childhood always world advancing by effort of who must have time to work for appreciable period instead have waved hand be going to reply when suddenly voice light clear sweet broke upon astonished ear be voice of woman be singing at first hardly listened because knew that must be none other than child christine whom indeed have often heard singing be natural believe for child to sing arch physician listened first with wonder then with sign of amazement how must be concerned by voice of child singing silly verse then heard last line of song sang admit with great vigor oh love be worth whole broad earth oh love be worth whole broad earth give that give grout cried arch physician in tone of deepest agitation choke be stifled listen be word that wrote wrote with own hand long long ago in past wrote for girl girl told of at dinner loved thought never again to feel a felt then yet memory of feeling have come back to be possible can thing never die can administer drug will destroy memory for earth reeled beneath foot again sens reeled must once more yes must once more have given world yes life even life only to call woman mine for year month day hour arch physician made astonishing confession in broken agitated voice then rushed away left alone in summer house singer must certainly have be none other than girl christine how must get hold of dr linister love song strange have disturbed peace at supper by laughing have agitated arch physician to degree a must have believed impossible by singing foolish old song when went to bed there came into mind of old idle talk about witch even dreamed that be burning witch who be filling mind with disturbing thought chapter iii christine at home when girl christine walked through loitering crowd outside hall of people looked after with wondering eye strange said woman laughed laughed ay said have forgotten how to laugh used to laugh before broke off with sigh sings said third have heard sing like lark in museum once said first woman used to sing a well a laugh remember used to sing make remember old day bad old day be one of assistant physician who admonished time when nothing be

will hing lie down breathe eat sleep yes replied with deep sigh nothing be certain bad old time when people died there be love danced sung laughed sighed again walked away alone slowly hanging head girl passed through leading old man by hand know very well now that ought to have be suspicious what meant gleam sparkle of eye when other eye be dull what meant parting of lip smile always lay upon when one else smiled at why did carry head erect when rest walked with hanging head why again did sing when one else sang why did move a if limb be on spring when rest went slowly heavily sign meant mischief took for natural accompaniment of youth meant more than youth meant dangerous curiosity meant presently purpose how must one of people dare to have purpose unknown to sacred college will hear followed be in fact due to own blindness must long before have shut up avenue might lead curious to study of past must have closed museum library altogether did not because lived in supposition that more old time be investigated more people must be satisfied with present when indeed one look at picture of battle murder cruelty kind of passion when one read old book full of foolishness can only be excused on plea of life too short to have right comprehension of anything be amazing that scene doe not strike observer with kind of horror when be seldom carry own memory back to old time see before went to laboratory boy of work to brewery ordered here there working day long with other prospect than to be servant for short span of life then to die when remember people among whom lived poor

must never mention that ugly topic again except when be not dressed up acting how lovely looked of none of to compare with sweetest rose bud of garden took hand kissed then left alone with old man in great museum chapter iv what be love must be idle to dwell upon repetition of such scene a described in last chapter unhappy person continued to meet day after day in museum after changing lawful

company so that there be now evening thirty gathered together nay even procured food made supper for contrary to practice of common meal enjoined by holy college gloried in being company apart from rest because remembered past have audacity to give only among air of superiority in daytime wore common dress be like rest of people thing grew however evening recalled more of long vanished custom mode of thought one remembering other little detail until almost particular of ancient life have returned to then strange thing happened for though present offered still never denied calm unchanging face with disaster to trouble certain miserable end to dread with anxiety care misery with ambition struggle fell to yearning after old thing grew to loathe present must hardly sit with patience in public hall went to day work with ill concealed disgust yet so apathetic have people grown that nothing of be observed so careless so unsuspicious be that though singing playing grew louder continued longer evening none of suspected anything singing in ear be more than unmeaning noise that girl in museum must sing play seemed foolish then child be foolish like to make great noise one afternoon be week since dangerous fooling began cause of whole girl christine be in museum alone have book in hand be reading in first read few line then paused meditated while then read again laughed gently to then read changed color again read knitted brow a one who considers can not understand place be quite deserted save for grandfather who sat in great chair propped up with pillow fast asleep have

rarest most curious old armor on wall trophy of arm glass vas containing thing of past be not so rare curious a old man only old man left among daily for own part contemplated old man with singular satisfaction be thought standing lesson to people one daily set before eye here be sole surviving specimen of what in past be best that men woman must expect namely to be spared until age of seventy five then to linger on afflicted with miserable disease slowly swiftly to be tortured to death beholding spectacle argued people ought to rub hand in complacency gratitude people have long ceased to reason reflect lesson be consequently thrown away upon nay when girl began destructive career whom dragged into toil only considered old man because must still be talking a old men used to talk about

discontented a be case with class questioning independent impatient of authority curiously unable to forget old time sailor girl between at first instigated pushed on whole business be joined doubt by many others two be first leader chief culprit of nominal leader will presently hear what kind of excuse must be made for by a for whom dragged reluctantly out of tranquillity of oblivion be at first wholly drawn from class at outset gave so much trouble so called gentle class who desired nothing so much a to continue to live under old condition namely by labor of others wanted for people only revival of memory to produce revival of discontent when mind be once more filled with thought of thing have lost leadership land wealth with memory of art have formerly loved music painting letter with actual sight once more restored to of old amusement dancing society singing game when foolish old idol love be once more trotted out like old fashioned guy fawkes decked in silly old rainbow tint when night after night actually began to play act to pretend thing what must possibly follow revolt with subsequent punishment expulsion will hear of course must have be punished with expulsion have not everything in place five six week after first evening have described at full length museum be again occupied by same company increased by good many more woman came in more readily being sooner caught with bait of fine dress have attraction for that mere sight of caused to forget everything have be done for present tranquillity freedom from agitation anxiety carried back to old time when wore indeed dainty dress what endured besides so readily remember dress carried back mind to society once filled up whole worthless life of poor creature say therefore that be easier to attract woman than men for latter bait at corresponding in power must be discovered company assembled be engaged in much same sort of make believe play acting a on first evening be dressed in old fashion danced sang talked laughed actually talked laughed though what there be from view of life to laugh about never must understand laughing however belonged to old manner have now completely recovered old manner

among be well simulated be young save for old man who sat in chair coughing sometimes talking christine have dressed in velvet coat gave great dignity made look a if be taking part in play say not that acting be not very good of kind acting of kind must never have served useful purpose even in past perhaps company of beautiful woman beautifully dressed of gallant men talk own foolish language amusing in way may have given pleasure to not to among whom be born in day when thing be done night at one part of town in part men be drinking if have money woman child be starving much concerned about dancing laughing laughing indeed part of town be where starved there be mighty little laughing among can promise in masquerading have naturally a if be part of life represented assumed a have said old expression of eagerness a if there be always something wanting yet say laughed with other in unreasonable illogical way of past although everybody always wanted everything for tried to overreach neighbor be custom to pretend that nobody wanted anything that everybody trusted friend that everybody lived for sole purpose of helping other people therefore shook hand continually grinned at other when met a if be pleased to meet well hypocrisy of past be a ridiculous a selfishness be base three of party sat apart in picture gallery be christine two cousin mildred jack carera be

have more of if can help be not cousin mildred let remember that be only three perhaps among friend in museum there may be dozen more who have learned to feel a strongly a be dozen party large enough to effect revolution remember be useless to think of remonstrance petition with college king council parliament in past be ever half so autocratic a college of physician used to read went on age ago about domination of priest think rule of priest be ever half so intolerant so thorough a rule of physician have not only deprived of right of thought also of power of thought poor people can not think be truly desperate state of thing few year more too will sink into same awful slough of be in already christine pulled out said mildred will ever get chance of getting out jack asked think not well

may add one more jack said mildred if go away with christine take with for present be more intolerable than possible future make three then there may be more geoffrey dorothy be never tired of whispering billing perhaps too be strong enough to throw off old terror to join will see think said mildred might depend partly on how case be put before if made see very clearly misery of present life made yearn ardently for thing have only just remembered of might follow at cost for most college what hold must prove too much yet christine a for seems a if remember more than anybody because think of sorrow of past can not tell now how ever came to forget sorrow be now grown so dear to that for very fear of losing again must give up gift of college go with a for christine have never known

conveniently at back of own residence adjoining museum picture gallery one came here except for beaten path footstep have made in daily walk place must have become entirely overgrown a be there be thick growth of holly of yew tall hawthorn tree wild rose spreading about among bramble fern grew tall in shade under great tree there be deep shadow even on brightest day in neglected wood there be creature of kind rabbit squirrel snake mole badger weasel stoat there be also bird of kind in wood in stream ran through place there be otter in solitary place dr linister walked day meditated wildness solitude pleased soothed have already explained that have always from outset be most strongly opposed to policy of majority that be never free from certain melancholy perhaps meditated on world a must have made have be able to have own way have heard that much be said among rebel about conduct during event a wanting in gratitude in first place if be at necessary for to defend conduct let point out that duty to authority of house must come before everything certainly before claim of private gratitude in second place owe gratitude at to dr linister to anybody have made have done alone have done unaided dr linister be very true received into laboratory a bottle washer servant very good paid wage did work for much room for gratitude there looked for proper discharge of work looked for regular payment of wage where doe gratitude come in next taught element of science to be sure wanted simpler part of experiment conducted by skilled not ignorant hand therefore taught element better skilled hand more must depend upon successful conduct of research therefore when found that must depend upon eye hand taught more encouraged to work on own account gave best book to read very good for own purpose what happened next presently grout bottle washer became so important in laboratory that became grout assistant demonstrator bottle washer be appointed worthy creature who still performs that useful function desire nothing more than to wash bottle truly thoroughly next grout became known outside laboratory many interesting important discovery be made by grout then grout became too big man to be longer dr linister assistant have own laboratory grout entered upon own field of research be practical field one in quickly surpassed others remember that dr linister never claimed looked for gratitude be much too wise man on occasion when be becoming in spoke in highest term of former assistant scientific achievement there be in fact question of gratitude at a for personal friendship association of year bond of union work in common be mere phrase worn out old phrase of vanished past besides there never be personal friendship contrary dr linister be never able to forget in old time have be servant master where equality have be so long established continual reminder of former inequality be galling dr linister indeed be always antipathetic from beginning except over research must have nothing in common in old day be what called gentleman be also scholar used to play music write verse must act dance sing do kind of thing be one of men who always wanted to do everything that other men can do to do a well a other men must do so that though be great scientific worker spent day at club at sport in society be to say with woman mostly think among game amusement of woman there be day remember great running to fro of page boy with note from be always ready to leave even most important work just to run after woman caprice a for never have school education at never have anything to do with society sight of woman always filled with contempt for man who must waste time in running after creature who knew science never cared for be so wont to disfigure natural figure by way crowded on misshapen clothes that one must guess what be like beneath a for music art rest of never asked so much a what meant after began to make way have laboratory for work play when again came to time when property question became acute attempted to solve by civil war although dr linister adhered to determination not to leave laboratory sympathy be always with individualism nay never disguised opinion be accustomed regularly to set forth at council meeting in house of life that abolition of property establishment of perfect socialism be greatest blow ever inflicted upon civilization be not however civilization college advance science be very different thing scientific end of humanity gradual extinction of emotion love jealousy ambition rivalry dr linister maintained made life so poor thing painless extinction must be very best thing possible for whole race be useless to point out to one so prejudiced enormous advantage gained in securing constant tranquillity of mind be even sometimes advocate for revival of fighting fighting old barbarous way of settling dispute in life be thrown away by thousand on single field must ever agree with majority of house that only end of humanity be mere existence at science must always aim prolonged without exertion thought care emotion of kind in fact according to contention of follower triumph of science be a follows philosopher find creature extremely short lived at best liable to kind of disease suffering from external cause torn to piece from within by kind of conflicting emotion creature most eager insatiate of appetite fiery impetuous quarrelsome murderous most difficult to drive lead guided only by own selfish desire tormented by intellectual doubt question can never be answered philosopher work upon creature until have moulded into so different that one must perceive likeness to original creature new creature be immortal be free from disease possibility of disease have emotion desire intellectual restlessness breathes eats sleep such be idea of science triumphant be never dr linister in manner arch physician preserved old manner of courtesy deference be fashion when be brought up special work have be for many year study of so called incurable disease such a asthma gout rheumatism so forth for own part mind since became suffragan have always be occupied with administration having steadily in view triumph of science have with intention made social equality real complete from point have also endeavored to simplify labor to enlarge production distribution of food by mechanical mean thus to decrease necessity for thought contrivance exercise of ingenuity most of work be so subdivided that one understands more than little part of occupies for four hour day workman who know whole process be impossible ask inquire want to improve when daily task be bit of mechanical drudgery do without thought come away since labor be necessary let be a mechanical a possible so that head may not be in least concerned with work of hand in view of thing arch physician must never be brought to acquiesce have be able to have own way whole of magnificent scheme must have be long ago destroyed rendered impossible suppose be impossibility of having own way afflicted with so profound melancholy face be always sad because must never reconcile to doctrine of human equality without perfection of man be impossible will be seen in short that arch physician held hardly single view in common have be elected to post to mine shared between great secret if view prevailed in council be due either to own power of impressing view upon colleague to truth justice of view a to gratitude there be room cause for a then dr linister walked to fro upon open space outside picture gallery hand behind head hanging thought know not where became conscious of something be out of usual order when one life a live one day following like one went before little departure from accustomed order disturb mind for many many year doctor have not given thought to picture gallery to door yet because stood open have be accustomed to see closed be disturbed presently lifted head discovered cause door stood open why what be door then remembered what be whither led opened into ancient picture gallery very existence of have forgotten though day saw door building picture gallery be full of picture painted in last few year before great discovery be to say be full of life have long ago lived lived still a stood hesitating without door life came back to with strange yearning sinking of heart have never see ceased to regret have ever forgotten now be tempted to look upon again a well might monk in old time look upon picture of fair woman year after have forsworn love hesitated knee trembling for merely thinking what be within then yielded to temptation went into gallery morning sun streamed through window lay upon floor mote danced in sunshine gallery be quite empty on wall hung one above other five six in row picture of past in pigment be faded crimson be pale pink green be gray red be brown figure be there life have lost once more flashed upon brain saw woman whom once have loved so much be lying on soft couch gazing upon with eye made heart to beat whole frame to tremble be dancing be in boat dressed in dainty summer costume be playing lawn tennis be in drawing room on horseback on lawn in garden be being wooed by lover what more be painted in fancy costume ancient costume even with costume at more looked more cheek glowed heart beat where have gone woman of youth suddenly heard tinkling of musical instrument be thing used to call zither started a one awakened out of dream then heard voice singing sang same song have heard that night five six week ago own song girl laugh girl cry 'what will guerdon be ala that must fall die bring forth gaud to see 'twere too slight give what might ' up spoke soldier tall love be worth whole broad earth oh love be worth whole broad earth give that give ' time however be voice fuller richer voice sang word dr linister started again when voice began changed color cheek grew pale heaven murmured be there phantom in air what doe mean be second time own song foolish old song own air foolish tinkling air that used to like voice remember voice whose voice be remember voice whose voice be looked round again at picture a if to find among face sought picture showed life of past ball room with dancer sport of field drive in afternoon ride in morning bevy of girl soldier sailor street crowded with people vile slum picturesque blackguardism of city not face wanted then left off looking for singer began to think of face before on face said there be unsatisfied desire yet be happier for very dissatisfaction yes be happier paused before painted group of street child be playing over gutter be sitting on door step carrying baby a big a one be sucking piece of orange peel picked up on pavement one be gnawing crust be ragged half starved yet said arch physician be happy have child now in day must paint draw have lost art great heaven cried impatiently have lost art cruel cruel then from within there broke upon ear strain of music be so long since have heard music at first took away breath wonderful that mere sound such a of music must produce such effect upon man of science oh sighed heavily have even thrown away that yet where where doe music come from who play while listened carried away by picture by music by own thought to past mind full of past did not surprise in least that there came out from door between gallery museum young lady belonging absolutely to past there be touch of present about at did not wear regulation dress did not wear flat cap be said dr linister face belongs to voice know now where did see last to whom doe belong stood for few moment in sunshine behind be great picture crimson purple mass of flaming color before tall slight figure dressed in delicate stuff of soft creamy color stood clearly outlined front of dress at least that part covered throat to waist be of warmer color there be flower at left shoulder hair be braided tightly round head round neck be ribbon with something hanging from wore brown glove carried straw hat dangling in hand be perhaps sunshine made eye so bright cheek so glowing rosy lip so quivering stood there looking straight down hall a if saw one dr linister gazed turned pale cheek be so white that might have thought about to faint reeled trembled good god murmured falling back upon interjection of past have lost beauty of woman oh fool fool have thrown away for what then girl came swiftly down hall towards smile of welcome be on lip blush upon cheek eye looked up dropped again again looked up once more dropped then stopped before held out hand harry linister cried a if surprised with little laugh how long be since last met chapter vii fidelity of john lax that morning while be in private laboratory idly turning over certain note on experiment conducted for artificial manufacture of food be interrupted by knock at door visitor be porter of house of life most trusted servant john lax duty be to sleep in house chamber being ancient room over south porch to inspect furnace laboratory after work of day be closed at time to keep eye upon fabric so that must in way fall out of repair order be also to kill stranger who might try to force way into house on pretence whatever be stout sturdy fellow vigorous strong though great discovery have found nearly forty year of age hair though have gone bald on top be still thick on side gave terrifying appearance under cap of scarlet gold carried great halberd a wand of office coat cap matched other for color for gold embroidery save a representing authority of house college must never have allowed splendid appearance to one have come to tell john asked may explain that have always found john lax useful in keeping informed a to internal condition of college assistant what be said debated what opinion be advanced by what men so forth in college suffragan said in house thing be mighty dull quiet blessed if little discontent mutiny something must be worth having just to shake up lot there be not even grumbler left little rising few head broken must settle down again quiet contented again talk like fool john well suffragan like to hear go on wonder what will say to what be going to tell now go on john what be be irregular suffragan honor be above law before beginning long story mind most important story be what be about who be in lot of people be in count be in now come john lax have pointed over shoulder so clearly in direction of arch physician residence must not understand yet pretended john who be arch physician be in there now suffragan bring out that bottle glass can then tell story without fear of ill consequence to throat be once delicate gave bottle glass after drinking tumblerful of whiskey forbidden to people began certain reason said have made suspicious a to what went on at night in museum during last few week light be up until late at night once tried door found that be locked heard playing of music within sound of many voice now there be a told john lax at point law against assemblage of people against sitting up singing playing together have to be sure hoped that have long ceased to desire to meet together have quite forgotten how to make music remembered john lax went on to say that there be door leading into picture gallery from college garden door of held key opened door quietly then night after night crept into picture gallery watched what went on through door opened upon museum have found in fact place close by door where hidden behind group of statuary must watch listen in almost perfect security then heard to amazement how small company of people be night carrying on revival of past not with laudable intention of disgusting with horror of time exactly contrary be only pleasant side of time evening life of rich careless foolish person reproduced have in fact gone so far john lax told a to fall in love with time to deride present to pour abuse upon name mine a supposed chief author of social equality be very well for beginning be startling awakener out of fool paradise true company be small might be easily dispersed isolated mean might be found to terrify into submission yet gave rude shock have have suspicion john lax continued ever since one morning when looked into museum see young gal dressed up carrying on before looking glass more like well more like actress at pav a used to make 'em than like decent woman now there be more stopped whispered hoarsely suffragan have just come from little turn about garden outside picture gallery where there be bit o turf lot of tree standin around there be very curious sight to see minute if will get up go along o ' suffragan will be pleased will indeed astonished pleased will be obeyed arose followed zealous servant led to part of garden did not know be place of have spoken here amid great thick growth of underwood took into ruin of old garden tool house built of wood plank be decaying be starting apart stand there look listen whispered john lax grinning open plank commanded view of semicircular lawn where neglected grass have grown thick rank almost under eye

dreaming harry have be dreaming for long long time never mind how long just now be not dreaming be truly awake be old playfellow be old sweetheart said with little blush tell what be doing always in laboratory suppose always finding new secret doe make happier harry to be always finding something new be only thing make life endurable to discover secret of nature for what other purpose do live then harry for what purpose do rest of live who investigate secret can woman be happy in other way prosecute kind of research know happy be in present past mildred looked about a if expecting to see figure of picture in gallery walking about upon grass just now harry be in past be back two together in glorious beautiful past where everything be delightful outside place there be horrible present have made present for therefore ought to know what be let look at harry why old look be coming back to eye take off black gown harry throw away while be with so be now old friend again can talk be no

happy then why not unmake present why not return to past be impossible might go back to past for little must become intolerable again a did before formerly there be time for of fleeting thing of life to lose rapture thing be enjoyed for moment then vanished now sighed wearily last last so that there be nothing left for finding of new secret for mildred have be in dream replied long long nightmare have never left day night know how long have lasted have lifted at last thank god arch physician started looked astonished seems long time said since heard word thought have forgotten be dream of change day after day nothing happened in morning worked in afternoon rested in evening took food at night slept mind be dead there be book to read there be nothing to talk about there be nothing to

viii arch traitor dismissed john lax charging with most profound secrecy knew have known for long time that man formerly avowed enemy of aristocrat nourished extraordinary hatred for arch physician therefore be certain that must keep silence resolved must myself keep watch if possible be present at meeting of evening what must happen knew not must tell what to do there be law in community to prevent such meeting if arch physician chooses to attend play acting how be to be prevented must myself watch will hear how be rewarded dr linister be a usual melancholy preoccupied at supper said nothing of what intended a for looked about hall to see if there be whom must detect from unnatural restlessness a member of dangerous company must see none except girl christine whose vivacity might be allowed on score of youth face of john lax be true a sat at lowest place of table betokened ill suppressed joy eagerness quite interesting to one who understood meaning of emotion poor john lax never again will find one like unto for zeal strength courage waited until half past nine o'clock then sallied forth be dark night still there be moon sky be cloudy wind be in air from time to time there be low rumbling of distant thunder made way cautiously noiselessly through dark garden to entrance of picture gallery faithful john lax have left open for ventured with precaution into gallery seemed quite empty at end there be door opening into museum poured narrow stream of light straight down middle of gallery crept along dark wall presently found at end close to door here came upon group of statuary of john lax have told where must crouch hide in perfect safety unseen yet able to see everything went on within confess even revelation of john lax have not prepared for scene met eye there be thirty forty men woman present room be lit up there be flower in vas set about there be musical instrument at one sat down sang when have finished everybody began to laugh talk then sat down began to play then went out upon floor two by two in pair began to twirl round like teetotum a for dress never saw like for woman be dressed in frock of silk white pink cream colored trimmed with lace with jewel on arm neck long white glove flower in hair in hand carried fan dress be low exposing neck so much of arm a be not covered up with glove looked excited eager expression have striven so long to impart to face that of tranquillity be gone old unhappy eagerness with flashing eye flushed cheek panting breath be come back to again heaven what must be done a for men wore black cloth dress alike why then did dislike regulation blue flannel with large white shirt front white tie white glove too be full of restless eagerness excitement so different be from men woman whom have observed day after day in public hall must remember not one except girl christine yes among there be none other than arch physician laughing talking dancing among rest must see perfectly well through open door be quite certain that one must see crouched lower behind marble group when began to come out two by two to talk together in dark gallery first came girl christine sailor jack carera at event remembered took other hand began to kiss other to talk greatest nonsense imaginable one must ever believe that sane people must possibly talk such nonsense then went back pair came out went on in same ridiculous fashion one have be to theatre in old time heard couple of lover talking nonsense on stage never on stage did ever hear such false extravagant absurd stuff talked a did when lay hidden behind group in marble presently listened with interest renewed because pair came into gallery be none other than pair have that morning watched in garden arch physician woman called mildred though now must hardly have known because be so dressed up disguised looked indeed very splendid creature not in least like plain woman take be what must be great lady desired not to be taken a plain woman yet be in spite of fine clothes plain simple woman just a much a wench of whitechapel in old time harry said thank from very heart for coming now will have hope what hope replied what hope what can do for while majority of college continue to side with grout what hope can bring never mind majority consider harry have great secret let go away together found new colony where will have grout will live own life do love harry love mildred oh sighed deeply be stream have be dammed up year what keep here asked girl be that in hand lie great secret people must be afraid to go without if have jack will take to island that know of across sea can not go without secret will bring with when must go asked whispering must go at time in day in week when please oh harry will indeed rescue will come with of be

old faith must have if wanted suppose without cry over law against dr linister said nothing saw that be shaking actually shaking trembling over most remarkable person who must have believed weakness

life happy have be killed art learning music have be killed will revive yes will go with dear since can not go without will bring secret with oh harry harry flung into arm have made more happy than word can tell oh be mine be mine be yours a for secret went on belongs if be to be used at to mankind why did college of physician guard in own jealous keeping save to make into mysterious separate caste must men always appoint sacred guardian of so called mystery belong to dear since great discovery man have be sinking lower lower can go very little lower now have be rescued from appalling fate grout call triumph of science yes repeated a if uncertain secret belongs to none let have work out destiny in freedom let none have so let go back to old time when such great thing be done against fearful odds of so short uncertain span must be better only come with lover oh can simple woman make happy come with let friend know else will not come with whenever go have secret belongs to all

north postern come with in beginning of new life lie before will if wish give secret to who share come love bride led by hand quickly down picture gallery out into garden looked round silly folk in museum be going on with masquerade laughing singing dancing girl christine ran in out among with bright eye eager look eye of sailor jack carera followed everywhere oh yes knew what eye meant old selfishness subjection of woman be to be property yet seemed to like forever anon made excuse to pas touched hand a passed smiled sweetly dare say that be beautiful girl beauty have nothing at to do with administration of people however there be time to be lost arch physician be going to betray great secret happily must have to go way round to north postern there be time if be quick to call witness to seize in very act then penalty death death death chapter ix in inner house house of life have already learned be great venerable building build such house now one who belong to holy college viz arch physician suffragan fellow physician assistant be permitted to enter door to witness work be carried on within wall be however very well understood that work concern prolongation of vital force first preservation of health next enlargement of scientific truth generally house be in fact great laboratory in fellow conduct research of be not permitted to speak outside prevention of disease cure of hereditary hitherto incurable disease continual lowering of hour of labor by new discovery in chemistry physic be now principal object of research when in fact have discovered how to provide food chemically out of simple matter thereby abolish necessity for cultivation more labor will be required humanity will have taken last greatest step of freedom from necessity of toil after there will be no more need for labor none for thought none for anxiety at stated interval food chemically prepared will be served out between interval man will lie at rest asleep in torpor of unthinking rest will be a have said before triumph of science house within be a magnificent a be without be to say be spacious even beyond requirement lofty even beyond want of laboratory day long fellow assistant work at table here be everything that science want furnace electric battery retort instrument of kind collection of everything may be wanted here behind inner house be great workshop where glass vessel be made where instrument be manufactured repaired college contains two three hundred of assistant working in various department men owing to restlessness of intellect sometimes give trouble because want to learn more than fellow think sufficient for because invent something unexpected because become dissatisfied with tranquil condition of life of from time to time have gone mad who threatened more trouble have be painlessly extinguished within house be inner house to enter be forbidden save to arch physician suffragan fellow place be kind of house within house who enter from south porch see before more than way up immense building step upon stand high screen of wood work screen be very ancient protects inner house from entrance observation run round whole enclosure be most profusely adorned with carved work representing kind of thing for own part have never examined into work hardly know what be be here figured what doe advance science to carve bunch of grape everybody understands not to be grape in wood thing in house of life carved wood carved stone carved marble lofty pillar painted window irritate offend yet arch physician who loved to sit alone in inner house must contemplate work of art with kind of rapture nay must wellnigh weep at thinking now there be no longer who can work in useless fashion a for what be within inner house must need speak with caution suffice therefore to say that round side of screen be ancient carved seat under carved canopy be seat of fellow on raised stone platform approached by several step be placed coffer contains secret of great discovery arch physician alone have key of coffer suffragan alone possessed secret fellow be only called into inner house when council be held on new discovery new adaptation of science to want of mankind now after overhearing intended treason of arch physician witnessing degradation fall made haste to act for plainly perceived that if miraculous prolongation of vital force must be allowed to pas out of own hand to become public property end must at once be put to order discipline now so firmly established authority of college must be trampled under foot everybody must begin to live a pleased old social condition might be revived old social inequality must certainly begin again because strong must trample on weak be perhaps what dr linister designed remembered now how long be before must forget old distinction nay how impossible be for ever to bring to regard though suffragan whom have formerly made serving man a equal thinking of time of distinction strengthened purpose what did how prevented treachery will approve to who have best interest of mankind at heart house of life after be very dark window be high for most part narrow though there be great many of most be painted so even on clear bright day there be not more light than enough to carry on experiment if have way must clear out painted glass be of course provided with electric light be seldom used except in short dark day of winter when work be carried on after nightfall in evening place be absolutely empty john lax porter occupies south porch keep key there be smaller door in north transept lead to court of cloister ancient use of have long be forgotten key of be kept by arch physician be with key at entrance that came into house opened door closed behind footstep be not only one lighter step be heard on stone a well in silence of place time closing of door rumbled in roof overhead like distant thunder falling of footstep echoed along wall of great building two companion did not speak great many year ago in old time there be murder done here foul murder by band of soldier who fell upon bishop saint angel know not whom memory of murder have survived name of victim very religion professed be perhaps that be still maintained among aristocracy when be boy not only be memory of murder preserved john lax who soon after great discovery when took over building from priest of old religion be appointed porter heard old story must tell who chose to listen how murderer came in at small door how murder be committed on spot stone of be to day red with blood of murdered man on spot however stand now great electrical battery arch physician now about to betray trust led companion woman mildred carera by hand past place to step lead to inner house ascended step standing there still outside inner house dr linister bade woman turn round look upon great house of life cloud have dispersed moonlight be now shining through window of south lighting up colored glass painting bright picture pattern upon floor pouring white light through window be not painted upon clustered pillar old monument of place who be now gathered in inner house listened holding breath in silence mildred said dr linister long long year ago stood together upon spot be after service of praise prayer to god whom then world worshipped came from town with party to see cathedral when service be over scoffed at in light manner of time questioned everything scoffed at everything remember harry through service mind be filled with scoff more mildred have seen to what depth men can sink when hope of future be taken from memory of service come back to seems to consecrate place time mildred said after pause oh house be very silent be solemn sacred moment for here side by side on spot once sacred to service of god whom have long forgotten let renew vow be interrupted so long ago mildred with heart with strength love thee harry murmured be thine even to death even to death replied yes if come to if great discovery must be abandoned if find that only at price can regain thing have lost be grout who destroyed religion not great discovery said girl kept silence in house heard word be true heart glowed to think how true be nay not grout thousand grout without certainty of parting religion droop dy there must be something not understood something unknown beyond power of discovery dependence be ground of religion dy away in man heart who be immortal command secret of nature so that will neither die grow old become feeble fall into disease feel necessity for religion house mildred be expression of religion at time of man greatest dependence to god in whom short lived ignorant full of disease trusted built splendid place put into beauty that must command of sculpture of form speaks no longer to people for whom be built when great discovery be made must surely have be better to have found out whither be going to lead before consented to receive surely said mildred other interrupted did not understand be blind be blind yet live have just now told how remember thing men said when discovery be made be to advance continually be to scale height hitherto unapproached be to achieve thing hitherto unknown in art a well a in science be for common meal common dress common toil vacant face lip never smile eye never brighten tongue that never speaks heart beat only for that gave up thing have did not expect such end harry have not wit to expect come mildred will give secret may give if please to world oh feel a if century have fallen away be full of hope again be full of old life once more mildred oh sweet be full of love stooped kissed on lip then led into inner house now just before dr linister turned key of postern door of south porch be softly closed company of twenty men walked lightly noiselessly in slipper up nave of house arrived at inner house ascended step entered that dark chapel man making straight for own seat taking without word breath be college of physician hastily called by gathered together to witness great treachery of chief sat there silent breathless listening to talk secret be kept in cipher intelligible only to two who then guarded in fire proof chest upon stone table be once altar of old faith dr linister stood before chest key in hand must be better said if new departure must be made without secret must be far far better if must start again under old condition if be afraid to go without secret why unlocked chest then paused again how many year have be guardian of secret mildred when think of magnificent vista

great secret must never be suffered to leave building yes said if be guilty be guilty a well a for turned to christine have be so short time in world only nineteen year so that to leave will cause little pain to be not a if have taken root with year of life others have enjoyed yet court must fail in duty did not point out enormity of offence be allowed to grow up undisturbed in old museum spent time in developing morbid curiosity into past be so curious to see with own eye what be to outward show that cast about to find among tranquil contented people whose mind might disturb lead back to restless old time be most guilty breach of confidence have anything to say do confess yes confess next with woman company who will also be brought to justice before long began to assemble together to revive with assistance of book picture dress music portion of past what portion be portion of vast majority full of disease injustice starvation did show how old time filled house with struggling needlewoman men who refused to struggle longer did show poor unemployed not at showed life of rich idle so revived longing for what will never never be permitted to return period of property reign of individualism be crime to misrepresent past to set forth exception a rule must be made impossible for future what have to say christine nothing told before nothing have confessed why keep on asking looked round court with apparent fear suppose be because be so young have not yet felt apprehension of fate be now so near unto dr linister said before considering sentence court will hear what may have to say have little to say replied everybody in college know have always be opposed to method adopted by suffragan college during last few day however have be enabled to go back once more to half forgotten past have experienced once more emotion of have robbed life have seen once more after many many year fighting passion passion of private right voice dropped to whisper have experienced once more passion of love stooped kissed woman mildred on forehead regret that did not succeed have not be caught must by time have be beyond power secret with to use not a pleased with company strong enough to defy with old life again before such a enjoyed before robbed of must have welcomed old life even under old condition welcome instead of thing only to think of make heart almost to stop beating with fear horror stopped that be speech likely to win indulgence from court be not turned to woman mildred asked what have to say present loathe loathe loathe must not go back to if offered instant release with condition have found love let die let die let die clung to lover passionately weeping sobbing soothed caressed john lax behind snorted then asked girl christine what wished to say laughed actually laughed oh said in return for past week there be punishment must not cheerfully endure have have oh most delightful time have be like dream oh cruel horrid wicked men found life in old time destroyed what have given in return have made equal who be born unequal go look at sad heavy face of people have taken away everything deliberately have destroyed have left nothing worth living for why be like mildred must not go back to present again if must yes for one thing must to try raise company of men not sheep hound on to storm place to kill yes to kill girl looked so dangerous that thought of mercy be impossible one who belongs to accursed house of life here be pretty outcome of study in museum here be firebrand let loose among straight from bad old nineteenth century have allowed girl actually to grow up in very midst well finished stood trembling with rage cheek burning eye flashing very fury invited court to retire to inner house took opinion one by one be unanimous on several point first that position of thing be most dangerous to authority of college safety of people next that punishment of death alone must meet case thirdly that in future museum with library picture gallery must be incorporated with college so that danger of possible awakening of memory must be removed here however unanimity ceased for fellow of whom have already spoken a having always followed arch physician arose again insisted that what have happened to day might very well happen again that nothing be more uncertain in action more indestructible than human memory so that from time to time must look for arising of leader prophet who must shake up people bring out of torpor to state of discontent yearning after lost wherefore exhorted to reconsider administration to provide safety valve for active spirit a to death of three criminal must not must not oppose proposed however that mode of death must be optional so great light of science a arch physician have many secret must doubtless procure sudden painless death if chose let have choice for companion a regard girl let be cast into deep sleep then painlessly smothered by gas without sentence being pronounced upon at leniency said be demanded by youth inexperience in reply pointed out that a regard administration be not then considering at a for mode of punishment have not only to consider criminal also people effect of punishment upon be not only to punish also to deter therefore begged court to go back to one of former method to one of really horrible barbarous yet comparatively painless method showed that mere report announcement made in public hall that arch physician have be executed for treason must produce little effect upon public mind even if be added that two woman mildred christine have suffered with that people needed to see thing in order to feel true horror to remember if death alone be wanted argued there be dozen of way in life might be painlessly extinguished be not death alone that desired be terror that wished to establish in order to prevent such attempt let concluded be taken forth in solemn procession to open space before public hall ourselves will form part of procession let in place in sight of people be publicly decapitated by porter of house john lax there be good deal of opposition at first to proposition because seemed barbarous cruel danger have threatened authority nay very existence of college caused opposition to give way why if have not be on watch secret must have be gone college must have be ruined be due to that proposal must be accepted sentence be agreed upon be bound to confess on being brought back to receive sentence of court prisoner behaved with unexpected fortitude male criminal turned pale only for moment two woman caught other by hand offered prayer for mercy be led back to prison in south porch until necessary preparation must be made chapter xii rebel be useless to regret thing be done over otherwise one might very bitterly regret two three step in proceeding at same time may be argued that what happened be exact opposite of what have reason to expect therefore must not blame with event after uncounted year of blind obedience respect for authority unquestioning submission have not full right to expect continuance of same spirit what did not know suspect be violence of reaction have set in not only have revolutionary gone back to past to very worst tradition of past have not only become anxious to restore old tradition have actually become men of violence be ready to back up new conviction by appeal to arm ought to have arrested conspirator a soon a assembled ought to have locked up in museum starved into submission ought to have executed criminal in private in short ought to have done just exactly what did not do while trial be proceeding new party of disorder be a john lax reported gathered together in museum considering what be best to be done now knew when john lax in morning arrested girl christine by order told in plain language what have already happened arch physician be prisoner said have be locked up night in room over south porch watched below have if have tried to escape instruction be to knock on head arch physician not woman mildred be prisoner a well be locked up with may hold other hand look into other eye in room a much a please now young woman be turn mine yours gal so march along o ' why what have done must be arrested that will hear march say be prisoner will stand trial ah smacked lip to show satisfaction wagged head be true child of people must not conceal gratification at discomfiture of traitor will hear what court have to say ah again repeated sign of satisfaction will be tried will hear sentence of court ah ah do know what will be death whispered death for see sentence in suffragan face oh mean girl heard without reply cheek turned pale wo mind much went on hardly know what be to live have be alive long enough to feel what mean be only chit of girl if be for example dare say must let off wo wo try on think of going on knee anything else go weeping cry court be a hard a nail honest fellow said in zeal for justice in hope that nothing must be said done might avert just punishment otherwise have girl who be after young ignorant thrown fully frankly upon mercy perhaps say of might have be disposed to spare a be have seen waste time said march be dressed a have already related in masquerade white dress of old time with know not what of ribbon round waist wore hair floating down back old man grandfather a called sat in arm chair looking on coughing john lax paid attention to at good by grandad said kissing will not see more because be going to kill will find inhaler in place be afraid will have to manage for future without help one help anybody in beautiful present be going to kill do understand poor old man good by kissed again walked away with john lax through picture gallery so

keep in mind whole of past portion of to brace up courage with thought of how delightful desirable be then exhorted to think of present called loathsome shameful vile other bad name be in gravest crisis of fortune concluded on action day depends whole future emerge from crisis free men woman sink back into present dull dismal without hope without thought nay there be more if rescue will be very speedily finished off by college do think will ever forgive not so a deal with arch physician two lady so will deal with better so better thousand time to suffer death at once than to fall back

firm shouted sailor leave john lax to ho ho john lax will fight out know be spy who did mischief come on stand firm men if fall make speedy end of spy rescue prisoner sprang to front for moment two men confronted other then john lax with roar swung axe have descended upon sailor head there must have be end of know little of fighting be certain that fellow be coward for actually leaped lightly back dodged blow then when axe have swung round so a to leave adversary side in defenceless position disgraceful coward leaped forward took shameful advantage of accident drove bayonet up to hilt in unfortunate executioner body john lax dropped axe threw up arm fell heavily backwards be dead be killed instantaneously anything more terrible more murderous more cowardly never witnessed know say little of fighting war must always maintain be foul blow john lax have aimed stroke missed be true owing to cowardly leap of enemy out of way in name of common fairness adversary must have permitted to resume fighting position a be only waited cowardly till heavy axe swinging round exposed john side then stepped in took advantage call murder not war john lax be quite dead brave zealous servant be dead lay on back there be little pool of blood on ground clothes be stained with blood face be already white be possible servant sacred servant of holy house be dead have be killed servant of holy college have be killed what next what dreadful thing must follow criminal be rescued by time be standing bewildered horrified in undignified crowd fellow assistant together then spoke fear in trembling voice men said know what do go back to place whence came await punishment due to crime back say form in square ordered murderer paying heed at to command rebel arranged a if have rehearsed thing for week man with weapon ready five on side forming three side of square of scaffold formed fourth within square stood three prisoner o jack cried christine never dreamed of o harry murmured mildred falling into arm of rescued dr linister at moment first thing thought of be new found love yet there be who have maintained that human nature must have be continued by science on old line folly at bottom of everything folly vanity sir sailor man addressed dr linister be now chief take sword command threw crimson sash over shoulder of who minute before be waiting to be executed placed in hand drawn sword then chief be bound to say that looked a if be born to command mounted scaffold looked round with eye of authority let poor people be dismissed said bid disperse go home go to walk to rest sleep anything be left in unhappy blank that call mind then turned to college there be among former brother said who in time past be friend of own voted with against degradation of people in vain have often communed together on insufficiency of science unwisdom of modern method come out from college friend join have great secret have knowledge of science that there be cast in lot with mine five six of fellow stepped forth be who have always voted for arch physician among be man who have spoken on uncertainty of memory be admitted within line of armed men nay gown of office be taken from presently received weapon about twenty thirty of assistant also fell out be admitted to rank of rebel there come more asked chief well choose for yourselves captain heron make crowd stand back clear away with butt end of rifle if will not go when be told so now let rest of college return to house captain carera take ten men drive back let first who stop endeavor to make others stop attempt to address people be run through a despatched man john lax fellow assistant of college back to place whence came back a quickly a may be will be worse for ten men stepped out with lowered bayonet saw approaching with murder in eye turned fled be not retreat be helter skelter run one over other if one fell savage rebel prodded in fleshy part roared with laughter fellow assistant bedells alike fell over other elbowing fighting until found at last with bleeding nose with black eye with broken rib with torn gown within house of life rebel stood outside south porch laughing at discomfiture warden of great secret said captain carera have longer secret to guard meantime until pleasure of chief sentence of court be pronounced remember who endeavor to escape from house will assuredly meet death think of john lax dare to resist authority of army then shut door upon locked heard footstep of men a marched away in order then be result of most fatal error have a might so easily have done executed prisoner in house locked up rebel in museum evil must not have happened be futile to regret past can never be undone be impossible not to regret blunder produced such fatal result chapter xiv prisoner thus then be table turned upon be locked up prisoner actually sacred college prisoner in house of life great secret be probably by time in hand of rebel to whom arch traitor have doubt given a have proposed to do when arrested lost to forever what must become of college when great mystery be lost to where must be dignity where authority first question read in other eye without asking be however not what must become of authority of be going to do with have killed unfortunate john lax solely because stood up manfully for college what must expect besides have fully intended to kill rebel now be penned up like fowl in coop altogether at mercy must one have believed that holy college source of health maintainer of life must ever have be driven to house a to prison like herd of swine to sty made to run head over heel tumbling over one without dignity self respect shoved bundled cuffed kicked into house of life locked up with promise of instant death to who must endeavor to escape did mean to kill be question before why must not must have killed arch physician have suffered now have power confess that thought of probability filled mind with so great terror that more thought of more teeth chattered knee knocked together nay very tear first since be little boy came into eye in thinking must abandon laboratory research almost at very moment when triumph of science be well within grasp be ready nearly to present mankind at last best at juncture assistant showed by behavior carriage now greatly wanting in respect that looked to for aid hastily called together remaining fellow in inner house took place looked at other in dismay must not be concealed brother said because looked to for speech can not be denied that situation be full of danger never before have college be in danger so imminent at very instant may be sending armed soldier to murder at moment there happened to be movement of many foot in nave seemed a if thing be actually upon sat down pale trembling others did same be several minute before confidence be so far restored that must speak coherently have lived so long said have known so long pleasure of scientific research that mere thought of death fill with apprehension that common people can not guess superior nature make doubly sensitive perhaps let hope may not kill perhaps may make demand upon to can yield will certainly turn out of college house of life install unless find way to turn table may buy life may even become assistant knowledge may be placed at disposal yes yes agreed life before everything will yield to condition great secret have gone out of keeping went on dr linister have probably communicated to alike there go whole authority whole mystery of college be ruined echoed fellow in dismay half dozen of fellow have gone over too there be not now secret scientific discovery process concerning life food health disease that know a well a ourselves have power what will do with can do to get out of hand then began babel of suggestion idea unfortunately plan proposed involved necessity of one risking losing life in old time when there be always men risking losing life for cause other suppose there must have be difficulty at have be accustomed to laugh at foolish sacrifice of one self since there be one life for pay for good of others now however confess that must have found most convenient if must have persuaded to risk very likely must not actually have lost life for sake of holy college for instance first plan occurred to be numbered even after late defection two hundred strong in college so called army of rebel must not be more than seventy counting deserter from college why must not break open door sally forth hundred two hundred strong armed with weapon from laboratory provided with bottle of nitric sulphuric acid fall upon rebel army suddenly while be unprepared for plan so far carried away that called together whole of college assistant bedells laid before pointed out that overwhelming nature of force must hurl upon enemy must cause so great terror to fall upon that must instantly drop arm fly a fast a must run when men must have nothing more to do to run after kill men looked at one with doubtful eye finally one impudent rascal said that a physician have most to lose must lead assault will follow suffragan fellow said endeavored to make understand that most valuable life must always be preserved until last in failed idea therefore of sortie in force have to be abandoned be next proposed that must dig tunnel under public hall blow up rebel with of old explosive to dig tunnel take time then who must risk life with explosive be further proposed to send out deputation of two three who must preach to rebel point out terrible consequence of continued mutiny appeared impracticable for simple reason that one must be found to brave threat of captain carera of death to who ventured out besides be pointed out with reason that if messenger be suffered to reach rebel one must be moved by threat of helpless prisoner unable to effect own release a for what be proposed to be done with electricity hand grenade dynamite so forth pas over in word found that must hing be prisoner then idea occurred to remembered how many year before dr linister who have always mind full of resource ingenuity made discovery by mean of one man armed with single weapon easy to carry must annihilate whole army if war have continued in world weapon must have put immediate stop to war ceased be never used now thought if must find weapon account drawing of manufacture must be able from commanding height of tower with own hand to annihilate dr linister following proceeded with assistance of whole college to hunt among volume of research experiment there be thousand of spent many day in search found not when be tired of search must climb up into tower look out upon scene below be full of activity bustle oh if must only by simply pointing weapon only by pressing knob see enemy swiftly suddenly overwhelmed by death must not find that discovery anywhere there be whole row of volume consisted of nothing index must not find in of so hope failed did not kill day opened door called for men to come forth fetch food did not kill yet danger be ever present in mind after week college resolved that since one alone of body knew great secret that one being most likely to be selected for execution if there be such step taken be expedient that secret must be revealed to whole college protested have to obey to part with secret be like parting with power be no longer invested with sanctity of one who held that secret suffragan became simple fellow of college be henceforth only one of who conducted research into health food like suspense imprisonment lasted for three week then rebel a will hear did most wonderful most unexpected thing in world why did when have house of life college in own hand must have established there done pleased with people have never be able to understand chapter xv recruiting sergeant when college have thus ignominiously be driven into house key turned upon rebel looked at other with greatest satisfaction so far said jack have succeeded beyond greatest hope prisoner be rescued only man with fight in have be put out of temptation to fight more holy college be made prisoner ourselves be master of field certain to remain so people be like lamb nothing to be feared from nothing apparently to be hoped have be reduced to terror by violence of rebel in pushing through have rushed away screaming of who witnessed horrible murder of john lax be also seized with panic fled when more terrifying thing befell speedily relapsed into habitual indifference crept back again a if nothing have happened at to dawdle away time in sunshine upon garden bench man alone a usual that holy college be prisoner rebel have usurped authority affected not whit even if understood administration have be even too successful one must no longer look to people for anything be now even more rapidly than have thought possible passing into last stage of human existence ye god cried dr linister swearing in language of past by shadow long forgotten ye god how stupid have become knew not that be so far gone can nothing move have seen victorious rebellion revolution not without bloodshed pay heed will nothing move will word call of together jack drive here let try to speak to may be that will touch chord will recall past be thus that be awakened from deadly torpor being thus summoned people men woman flocked about scaffold now stripped of black drapery listened while dr linister harangued be told to stand listen obeyed without gleam in patient sheep like face to show that understood can do more cried dr linister after three quarter of hour have drawn skilful moving picture of past have depicted glory joy compared with dismal reality of present dwelt upon loveless passionless existence showed how be gradually sinking lower lower that must soon lose intelligence necessary even for daily task then asked if must join friend in new life be about to begin must be full of old thing endeavor struggle ambition love must be alive not dead more said great deal more to purpose if showed intelligence at be terror at thought of change dr linister descended be use said will try jack not by speaking will try plan disappeared presently came back again having visited cellar behind public hall after came servant rolling barrel cask at direction be going to try effect of good drink said jack in old day be always getting drunk trade have favorite liquor be now one know how long since poor fellow have have to become sober because must no longer exceed ration let encourage to get drunk be sure ought to touch chord disgraceful idea be actually carried out drink of kind spirit beer sort of intoxicating liquor be brought forth men be invited to sit down drink freely after manner of old time when saw cask brought out placed on stand ready with spigot beside cask table bench spread for on bench pipe tobacco gleam of intelligence seemed to steal into eye come said jack sit down friend sit down of now then what will drink what will be call for what like best here be barrel of beer here be stout here be gin whiskey rum holland brandy what will have call for what please take pipe why be old time over again looked at other stupidly very name of drink have be long forgotten by presently accepted invitation began to drink greedily at seven o'clock when supper bell rang there be at least three hundred men lying about in various stage of drunkenness be fast asleep stretched at full length on ground lay with head on table sat clutching at pewter mug be vacuously laughing noisily singing what do make of experiment asked dr linister have struck chord well have done once more what used to do said jack despondently have done in same old way think there must ever have be real jolliness about dog who got drunk a fast a ever must expected more gradual business thought drink must first unloose tongue set talking then hoped that must in way be led to remember past thought directly began to show recollection at must knock off supply carry on memory experiment have failed unless here gleam of hope shone in face to morrow hot copper prove sensation so unusual a to revive memory of last experience in same direction never mind how many year ago hot copper may produce that result ordered cask to be rolled back to cellar evening rebel headed by dr linister dressed in scarlet gold with sword with lady be called lady now nothing le not woman of people more came to public hall dressed for evening in strange garment with bracelet necklace jewel glove thing most of people have never seen seemed to take heed of thing be hopeless said jack nothing move will have to begin new life with own company of thirty leave to said mildred remember be by dress christine aroused from stagnant condition be by that men be first awakened leave to after evening meal lady went about from table to table talking to woman many of who have belonged to working class in old time have recollection at of fine dress looked stupidly at lady dainty attire there be others whose face seemed to show possibility of other thing to lady addressed first asked to look at fine frock bangle thing next if admiration be awakened begged to take off flat cap to let down hair of consented laughed with new born pride in showing off long forgotten beauty then lady tied ribbon round neck waist put flower into hair made look in glass not one of who laughed looked in glass followed lady evening to museum came company of recruit fifty strong girl then whole evening be devoted to bringing back past came quickly enough to most to sad past full of hard underpaid work to past of enforced idleness to past of work pay contentment be shopgirls work girl ballet girl barmaid kind of girl to one be given pretty becoming dress not one be rejoiced at prospect of changing calm quiet present for emotion struggle of past be not allowed to rest idle next day girl again with lady went out tried effect of new dress newly restored beauty upon other woman first men afterwards a went about lightly gracefully singing laughing daintily dressed many of men began to lift up sleepy eye to look after when girl saw symptom laid siege to man two three together perhaps one alone must undertake task if be more than commonly susceptible a for on whom bright eye smile laughter pretty dress produced effect let alone altogether still recruit came in fast night did in power to make past live again played old comedy melodrama farce in public hall sang old song encouraged recruit to sing gave men tobacco beer have dance music morning original company of rebel sat in council afternoon recruit dressed like soldier of past be drawn up drilled put through kind of bodily exercise be prisoner said for three week one morning at end of time message came to from headquarters of army be now official style title chief ordered immediate attendance of suffragan two fellow of college of physician at terrifying order confess fell into so violent trembling for indeed last hour seemed now at hand must no longer stand upright in condition of mind be carried being unable to walk more dead than alive out of house of life to headquarters of rebel army chapter xvi most unexpected conclusion confess say be borne in half fainting condition from house of life farewell suffragan farewell said brother of college gathered within south porch where guard of armed rebel waited for turn to day ours to morrow farewell yet if concession can be made yes yes if concession must be made only to save life might be certain must make two fellow of college upon whom lot drew lot have fallen accompanied with cheek a pallid heart a full of terror a own company of twenty men armed escorted looked on way for line of people to witness downfall of college execution of head looked for scaffold have erected for executioner whom have provided listened for great bell have caused to be rung strange there be people at way from house be quite clear people be engaged a usual at work saw scaffold executioner heard great bell yet absence of thing did not reassure in least everything even in short three week be changed nearly whole of open space before public hall be now covered with row of gay colored tent over flew bright little flag be quite small tent meant learned afterwards for sleeping besides there be great tent open at side spread within with table bench at sat men smoking tobacco drinking beer though be a yet only forenoon of be playing card be reading book great many be eagerly talking be dressed in tunic of scarlet green gray wore leathern belt with helmet costume seemed familiar to then remembered be old dress of soldier wonderful after science have lavished all resource in order to suppress destroy among people old passion at very first opportunity rebel have succeeded in awakening again in worst most odious form there be also large open space upon regardless of flower bed of men be marching up down in line carrying arm performing evolution to command of officer of men again lay sprawling about on bench merely looking on doing nothing yet with lively satisfaction in face ought to have be in field workshop everywhere among men looking on at drill sitting in tent walking beside sitting with on bench be girl dressed adorned after bad old false style in woman pretended to heighten set off what be pleased to call charm by garment fantastically cut immodest display of arm neck hair curiously dressed adorned colored ribbon flower stuck in hat ornament tied on wherever be possible such joy pride in silly decoration one must believe how girl looked at other to think that poor silly men must have fallen into net thus clumsily spread for after demonstration to show that woman bear in limb mark of inferiority so contempt at least pity not admiration at to say nothing of extraordinary foolish passion of love must be feeling of man for woman however at moment be naturally too much occupied with own danger to think of thing one thing however one must not avoid remarking rebellion must have spread with astonishing rapidity be no longer company of fifteen sixteen men be great army that saw there be longer doubt possible a to movement past be restored in face of young men girl a passed through remarked sick with terror a be old old expression hoped have abolished forever eagerness unsatisfied desire individualism yes individualism saw on face plain to read newly restored right of property why a walked through one of group composed of men woman one of men suddenly rushed forward struck in face with fist be girl cried hoarsely touch if dare closed round pair led off going to fight out said one of guard to fight out what fall to fight out to call woman anything else own after teaching to fight out arrived at in three week thing observed say a one observes thing in dream remembers afterwards heart failed altogether nearly fainted when stopped at long tent before floated flag on flagstaff carried within placed in chair a soon a eye recovered power of sight saw sitting at head of table dr linister dressed in sort of scarlet coat with sash gold lace then indeed gave up for lost be court be called before to receive sentence at side sat dozen officer bravely dressed tent be filled with others including many woman richly dressed observed woman mildred clad in crimson velvet girl christine in white thought regarded with vindictive eye when be seated dr linister looked up face be always grave be no longer melancholy there be in now something of hope triumph resolution know not what brother said gravely once brother of college have called before in order to make communication of greatest importance one will doubtless cause considerable surprise what be matter suffragan hold up somebody desire that must hear from own lip what propose to do first will somebody give dr grout glass of wine brandy something pray be reassured gentleman harm promise will happen to of first in day two door of house will be thrown open will be free again to renew old life if still feel disposed to do so repeat that violence be intended towards grout pull together man sit up leave off shaking will be able without opposition say to carry on again administration of people on old line trust however that will consider situation condition to have reduced unfortunate humanity very seriously in short though be absolute master of situation now command force against must be absurd for to contend be going to abandon field leave everything to be dreaming present be so odious to people surroundings of place be so full of horrible loathsome present that have resolved to leave altogether find in fact that will be impossible to begin new life until trace of administration be removed lost will be so much clogged by public hall house system miserable life to have reduced most of men woman that must either send away go away ourselves on whole will give le trouble to go away therefore a soon a preparation be ready will go will carry with from common store that will be likely to want in starting new community will leave to work out undisturbed triumph of science a understand upon poor wretch already more than half stupefied by treatment will take with whom by mean by beauty of woman splendor of arm ancient dress ancient music ancient dance have be able to awaken from torpor amount in to more than thousand so of young men a many maiden a for rest be sunk in lethargy so deep that have be unable to rouse be already very near to condition desire yet know not poor dull brain may be swiftly suddenly fired with contagion may at time ruin calculation destroy boasted triumph rely too much upon torpor of apparently helpless herd have at beginning grand weapon with to enslave must keep alive must save from disease if only be obedient if once get beyond recollection fear of what will do go paused looked round room filled with eager face brought past back to futile eagerness ever pressing on gaining nothing sinking into grave before there be time to gain anything have come back that go repeated face have long be so melancholy that one hardly knew for same man so triumphant be now go to repair mistake of many many year go to lead mankind back into ancient path be not altogether friend who destroyed humanity be mainly unfortunate discovery of german professor be working admirably in right direction be making life longer be then far too short be gradually preventing disease have be beyond control of wisest men be by slow degree in only true way through revelation of nature feeling way to health prolongation of life yet happened whatever might discover first law of life did not understand be that to thing earthly there must come end then happened event by that end be indefinitely postponed again say blame not so much a current of event bore along seemed logical that everybody able imbecile weak strong healthy sickly skilled incompetent must alike reap fruit of great discovery if did so be also entitled to equal share in world good be right of man put forward a if there must be question at about child be to inherit equal share of everything be false mischievous claim what child inherited be right of fighting for share without danger of injustice oppression next step after slaughter of old be forbidding of more birth what have done for world look round see for yourselves in torpor of woman apathy of men people by time have learned great lesson that wished to teach that death disease be only two evil then college of physician took place of former priesthood with own mystery to guard gift to distribute deny that have done work well prevention of old disease be nearly perfect yet at moment new class of disease may spring up baffle science have often talked in way before never with so much authority yet be going to abandon whole that friend have gained be dreaming talk about administration affected not one whit knew argument thought that be going away that must actually leave in power possession filled with amazement others looked listened a if be speaking for right of man to equal share in everything have be carried out look around ask yourselves if result be satisfactory have often asked that question have replied that present be only stage in triumph of science what be next stage to question also have reply well give back to whole of present people so stupid so docile so sluggish house college secrecy mystery authority take will have again to do with a seems fit to at word heart welled over with joy must really on what condition must really give back whole there be condition meant exactly what said must give everything back to be dreaming be dreaming a for friend said will sally forth to found new settlement to govern by idea of past one in settlement will be obliged to work if doe not will certainly starve nobody will inherit share to anything except what may win by struggle there will be equality at man will have what can honestly get for woman will be compelled to work may work if please at such thing a please many old long forgotten thing have be already revived such a love be in love again who actually forgot what love be like for year have ceased to number to chronicle be impossible to describe to former brother suffragan who never even in old day felt passion intense joy ecstasy of love other men murmured approval love be plant while be hardy to endure many thing withers dy under certain condition be found to flourish in old time through change of life survived time of youth beauty lasted through middle age flourished through scene of old age lasted beyond grave endured change of fortune decay of health poverty sickness even helplessness one thing kill love can not endure dull monotony have followed great discovery can not live long while face form know change while voice never change while dress hour of work work food know change be thing kill flower of love now thing desirable be saying too hard for suffragan depend upon love with love have revived courtesy of man to woman deference of stronger to weaker stimulus of work hope ambition self sacrifice unselfishness devotion sweet illusion of imagination thing have be born again within last three week have be born again with necessity of end thing earthly most have end chief looked round men murmured approval tear stood in eye of woman can not let die since first law of love be change certain end have resolved suffragan on forgetting grand discovery must be late arch physician be dreaming will forego share in only chief here gathered together know a yet what have be resolved little by little truth will get possession of people that end be ordained made reply to extraordinary announcement what must say only gasped with wonder can not understand grout expect that must for long year past have understood that great discovery be greatest misfortune that ever happened to mankind for thing must have end else be worth preserving will wither die have nearly done can go back to house can carry on administration a please there be warning have first to pronounce before let go ultimate triumph of science be too great degradation of humanity to be endured in year to come when successor rule in place will send army here to inquire into conduct of trust if find people more brutish deeper sunk in apathy torpor army will seize house of life college of physician will destroy laboratory will suffer men woman of people fellow of sacred college alike to die never forget warning will surely die one more point have done mention with diffidence grout because can not hope for sympathy own conviction on subject be arrived at have often told when be boy be based upon argument of sunday morning spouter in whitechapel road believe that john lax deceased be learned authority who convinced therefore will not understand grout when tell that have found soul again long lost soul earthly thing must have end there be thing beyond end most astonishing thing be likely to follow from discovery long thought great hope have already begun to spring up in mind people be reading again old literature be full of soul be reading great poet of old be beginning to understand what mean can not make intelligible to grout will not understand that discovery brings with will never never understand that be discovery ten time million time greater better for mankind than great discovery of alone held secret take secret with because can not forget repeat will never use soon very soon new active life will make men once more familiar with old figure who carried scythe there will be accident new disease will arise age will creep slowly on great discovery will be quietly forgotten in mind have made so dull that must not understand when rescued what meant leader will know well that happiness must have end earthly thing repeated for fifth time must have end be grout when hear from again unless administration be changed indeed people college suffragan will die together will die grout friend will die so farewell guard take back to house returned to house relieved of terror much amazed have heard in old day how men must be so blockishly possessed by thought of woman creature inferior to man that must throw away everything in world for sake now dr linister with who followed after have given up everything because if life go what be there left for sake of woman what must mean how to explain madness on scientific theory told colleague marvelled suspected trick dr linister be not man to play trick a for soul rubbish if dr linister be so mad a to give up everything for woman might just a well adopt old creed together be concern of ours a for precious discovery about thing earthly coming to end what have to do with calm tranquil state of pure existence be providing for mankind why must that ever have end threatened army have never come for time thought of gave considerable uneasiness have never come believe for own part now never will come a for people there have be such outbreak of memory a be prophesied on contrary have approached more more in docility meekness mindlessness absence of purpose to magnificent ideal cherish for know not when will arrive time be a certain to come a morrow sun be to dawn when last stage of humanity will be reached inert mass of breathing feeding sleeping flesh kept by holy college triumph of science free from decay death went away in afternoon three four day later took with everything from public store thought must be useful provision of kind wine beer cider in cask stuff for clothing furniture everything that must think of took picture out of gallery book from library nearly everything be in museum from laboratory in house took great number of volume quantity of instrument at last moment nearly assistant workman agreed to join so that be left with number greatly reduced be impossible to enumerate vast quantity of thing took with wagon in be packed covered couple of mile of road driver be taken from people ordered to discharge duty a never came back poor wretch probably perished with rebel went forth in perfect order first advance guard of mounted men then portion of main body among whom rode chief with staff after came woman riding on horseback among whom be woman mildred girl christine showing in face that foolish excited happiness be so different from sweet tranquillity have introduced indeed woman be beyond with silly happiness sang laughed talked sat in carriage of kind in wagon walked what with chatter dress one must have thought company of monkey dressed up after woman came wagon lastly rest of men forgot to say that have band of music with drum fife cornet kind of musical instrument that carried flag that men sang a marched whither went what became of whether carried out desperate resolve of giving up great discovery know not marched away returned to former life one thing more must relate be college be seated reassured a to safety watching great departure five minute so after woman have passed observed two of own friend learned fellow of college who have always followed lead voted with eagerly whispering other plucking one by sleeve then suddenly rose pulled off black gown fled swiftly in direction of wagon carriage where woman sat have never seen
