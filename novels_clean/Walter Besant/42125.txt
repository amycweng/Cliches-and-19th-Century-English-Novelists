asleep in cottage suppose boy be asleep somewhere in farmyard ' girl led way dog followed passed through door into garden of front be not exactly well ordered garden because everything seemed to grow a pleased then in samson have not to coax flower plant into growing grow because plea to grow be reason why grow so tall so fast garden faced south west be protected from north east by house by high stone wall there be not anywhere on island warmer sunnier corner than little front garden of holy hill geranium clambered up wall beside among branch of tree fuchsia together covering front of house

island maintained population of over two score hill rise behind house be southern hill of two with broad valley between make up island of samson hill slope steeply seaward to south west be not lofty hill by mean in scilly there be lofty hill when nature addressed to construction of archipelago brought to task light touch at moment happened to be full of feeling for great artistic effect may be produced by small elevation especially in place where material be granite therefore though raised alpine peak in scilly provided great abundance variety of bold coast line with rugged cliff lofty carns headland piled with rock success a artist in genre have be undoubtedly wonderful actual measurement of holy hill samson why must measure have be taken for admiration of world by ordnance survey be really no more than hundred thirty two foot not foot more le then one know hill ten time height herefordshire beacon for example be not half so mountainous in effect produced only hundred thirty

contralto one must hear not even coastguard on telegraph hill of star fort song sang be one taught by old lady who have sung in old old day when road be always filled with merchantman waiting for convoy up channel when island be rich with trade of ship piloting wreck to say nothing of free trade went on gallantly without break stop a sang lifted arm swung in slow cadence a nautch girl sometimes swing arm what sang be none other than old song early one morning just a sun be rising heard maid sing in valley below oh deceive oh never leave how must use poor maiden so in year of grace armorel be fifteen year of age looked nineteen twenty because be so tall so well grown be dressed simply in blue flannel straw hat carried in hand be trimmed with red ribbon at throat have stuck red verbena naturally took to red because complexion be so dark black hair black eye strongly marked brow dark cheek of warm ruddy hue lip full mouth finely curved feature large regular be already though so young tall handsome woman able to understand thing must recognise in dark complexion in carriage in eye in upright figure true castilian touch gipsy be swarthy negro be black mulatto be dusky be not colour alone figure carriage also mark spanish blood noble spanish lady yet how must get to samson wore glove can not buy glove in samson hand be brown with exposure to sea sun to wind rain be by mean tiny hand strong capable hand arm one ever saw for shape whiteness must not be matched must have disgraced young fellow of own age for strength muscle be fairly to be expected in one who continually sailed rowed across inland sea of archipelago who went to church by boat to market by boat who paid visit by boat transacted business by boat went by boat to do shopping who row day upon salt water know how to manage sail when breeze be strong atlantic surge roll over rock roughens still water of road must need be strong sound for own part admire not fragile maiden so much a who rejoices in strength youth in woman a well a in man must be brave lusty clean of limb a well a of heart strong of arm a well a of will enduring hardness of voluntary labour a well a hardness of involuntary pain with foot can walk run climb with hand can hold on girl a armorel so tall so strong so healthy offer methinks home ready made for virtue especially virtue feminine to house therein here will remain growing stronger day until at last have become part parcel of very girl can not be parted from whereas when visit puny creature weak timid delicate 't be better to remain silent how many time have girl wandered morning afternoon down rough face of hill stood looking vaguely out to sea presently returned home again how many such walk have taken forgotten for hundred time yea thousand time do over over again old familiar action little piece of day routine forget when lie down to sleep there come thousandth time when same thing be done again in same way yet be never to be forgotten for on day happens thing change charge whole life be first of many day be beginning of new day from may have happened before everything will now be dated until end mohammed lived many year thing happened unto successor be dated from flight be for nothing that have be told what thing armorel did how looked on day not so for sake of what happened afterwards because history of armorel begin with restless fit drove out of quiet room down hillside to sea history begin like history of woman worth relating with man cast by sea upon shore of island maiden always life upon island whether man be cast upon shore by sea of society sea of travel sea of accident sea of adventure sea of briny wave roaring wind jagged rock matter little to armorel be last to dear dorothy violet will doubtless be by sea of society day cast before foot will ever after begin new period in reckoning armorel stopped song a suddenly a have begun stopped because on water below not far from shore saw strange thing have good sea eye ordinary telescope doe not afford field of vision much larger clearer across water than armorel eye thing be so strange that shaded forehead with hand looked more curiously must be strange on evening even after calmest day of summer when sun be setting low to see small boat going out beyond samson towards western islet there swell of ocean be always rolling among rock round crag headland of isle only in calm weather in broad daylight can boatman who know place venture in water not even most skilled boatman must steer for outer island at sunset for there be hidden rock long ridge of teeth run out from island to tear grind to powder boat must be caught in devouring jaw there be current also run swiftly unexpectedly between island to sweep boat along with till will strike rock so go down with who be abroad there be strong gust sweep round headland blow through narrow sound so that be only when day be calm in full light of sun that boat can sail among island yet armorel saw boat on water not mile from samson with two men on board more than boat be apparently without oar sail be drifting out to sea what did mean looked wondered looked again remembered tide be ebbing boat be floating out with tide breeze have dropped there be still something left what there be came from south east helped boat along there be not much sea foot of great minalto be white white foam kept leaping up side on right over ledge round white island water be tearing boiling white angry heap why wind be getting up sun be setting if did not begin to row back a hard a must soon must be out to sea in dark looked again thought more sinking sun fell upon boat lit up so plainly that must now see very well two thing first that boat be really without oar sail at next that two men in be not native of scilly must not discern face must tell by appearance way sat in boat that be not men of place besides what must islander want out in boat at time in such place be therefore visitor by quiet way in sat a if mattered not at be perfectly plain that understood little nothing of danger again considered now became certain to looking down upon boat that current be not taking out to sea at must be dangerous enough actually straight on ridge ledge of rock lying off south west of white island then seized with sudden terror turned fled back to farm chapter ii presented by sea 'peter cried armorel in farmyard peter wake up where be boy wake up come quick ' boy be not sleeping however came forth slowly obediently in rustic fashion be little older than most of who still permit to be called boy unless look deceived one be great deal older for be entirely bald save for few long scattered hair be white beard whisker also consisted of nothing few sparse white hair moved heavily without spring of boyhood in foot have peter jumped run one might in haste have inferred condition of drink mental disorder a for shoulder too be rounded a if by weight of year thing be rarely seen in boy yet armorel called antique person boy ' answered to name without remonstrance 'quick peter ' cried 'there be boat drifting on white island ledge tide running out strong there be two men in have got oar in boat ignorant tripper suppose will be killed to certainty unless quick peter followed flying footstep with show of haste movement of leg approaching alacrity then be always slow boy one who loved to have work done for therefore when reached landing place found that armorel be well before that have already shipped mast sail oar be waiting for to shove off samson have two landing beach one on north east below bryher hill other farther south on eastern side of valley there might be third better than on porth bay if anyone desired to put off there on west side facing other island where nobody have business at except to see rock shoot wild bird beach used by holy hill folk be second of two here kept boat have old stone boat house to store gear be here that armorel stood waiting for companion peter be slow on land at sea however alone be slow who doe not know what can be got out of boat how can be got peter did posse knowledge islander in fact have be born with also know that nothing at sea be gained by hurry be maxim be said to rule govern conduct on land a well a afloat peter therefore when have pushed off sat down took oar with more appearance of hurry than if be taking boat load of box filled with flower across to port armorel took other oar 'they be drifting on white island ledge ' repeated armorel 'and tide be running out fast peter made reply armorel expected none dipped oar rowed in silence for ten minute then peter found utterance spoke slowly 'twenty year ago remember well boat went ashore on very ledge tide be running out strong like to night there be three men in visitor be who wanted to save boatman pay body be never found ' then pulled on in silence doggedly in ten minute more have rounded point at respectful distance for reason well known to navigator nautical surveyor of scilly peter without word shipped oar armorel did likewise then peter stepped mast hoisted sail keeping line in own hand looked ahead while armorel took helm jinkins boat ' said peter because be now in sight of 'what will jinkins say when hears that boat gone to piece 'and two men who be will jinkins say nothing about men betrangers be gentleman suppose well if breeze doe soon ah here be ' wind suddenly filled sail boat heeled over under breeze moment after be flying through water straight up broad channel between two minaltos samson sun be very low now between west lay boat be pursuing small black object with two black silhouette of figure clear against crimson sky now armorel perceived that have by time gotten inkling at least of danger for longer sat passive have torn up plank from bottom with one kneeling in bow be working a with paddle without science boat yawed way that still kept on course drifting to rock touch ledge peter ' said armorel behe will be in little bit in five minute water be rushing over like mill stream ' said ignorant of mill stream because there be none on scilly comparison served 'if touch peter replied 'we may just go home again for will be no good to nobody ' beyond boat must plainly see water breaking over ledge sun lit up white foam leaped flew over black rock just showing teeth above water a tide went down here be problem may find plenty like in book of algebra given boat drifting upon ledge of rock with current tide given boat sailing in pursuit with fair wind aft given also velocity of current speed of boat distance of first boat from rock at what distance must second boat commence race in order to catch up first before drive upon rock second boat paying close attention to problem came up hand over hand rapidly overtaking first boat where two men not only understood at last danger be in also that attempt be being made to save in fact one of who have tincture flavour of mathematics left in from school day remembered problem of class must have given great deal to have be back again in school working out one of presently boat be so near peter hailed 'boat ahoy back back will be upon rock back all know ' 'we have broken oar shouted 'keep off ' peter bawled again even with plank taken from bottom of boat practised boatman must have be able to keep off long enough to clear rock two young men be not used to way of sea 'put up hellum ' said peter quietly 'what be going to do ' girl obeyed first a one must do at sea asked question afterwards only one chance must cut across bow two lubber ought not to be trusted with boat there be plenty of room ' looked at ledge ahead at own sail steady tightened rope boat changed course then peter stood up called again hand to mouth back back all know ' sat down said quietly 'now then luff be luff can ' boat turned suddenly be high time right in front of only few yard in front water rushed a if over cascade boiling surging among rock at high tide there must have be calm unruffled surface of ocean swell now there be roaring flood swelling whirlpool girl looked round only for instant then boat crossed bow of other armorel a passed caught rope be held out to one moment more be off rock in deep water towing other boat after then peter arose lowered sail took down mast 'nothing ' said 'between mincarlo now gentleman if will step into boat can tow yours along with so take care sir sit in stern beside young lady can row of ' must row said in day man be a much ashamed of not being able to row a fifty year ago be ashamed of not being able to ride peter took one oar gave other to stranger nearest then without more word dipped oar began to row back again sun went down suddenly became cold armorel perceived that man beside be quite young man not more than one two twenty wore brave attire even brown velvet jacket white waistcoat crimson necktie also have soft felt hat nature have not yet given much beard what there be of wore pointed with light moustache so arranged a to show how must be worn when became of respectable length a sat in boat seemed tall did not look at like one of bawling boastful tripper who sometimes come over to island for night pretend to know how to manage boat yet 'what do mean ' asked girl severely 'by going out in boat when ought to have known very well that must not manage 'we thought must ' replied disconcerted pretender with meekness suitable to occasion indeed under such humiliating circumstance captain parolles must become meek 'if have not seen ' continued must most certainly have be killed ' begin to think might must certainly have gone on rock there be island close by must swim boat have touched rock must have be dead in three minute maid of wisdom continued 'nothing must have saved boat must have come near to think of standing swimming in current among rock oh know scilly 'no replied still with meekness disarmed wrath `` m afraid not 'tell how happened ' other man struck in who be wielding oar also be young man of shorter more sturdy build than other have not unfortunately confined whole attention in youth to football might have made good boatman really young man whose appearance conveyed information suggestion at about except that seemed healthy active vigorous that be presumably short sighted must not have worn spectacle will tell how came about said 'this man must go sketching coast told that island be so beautifully benevolently built that good bit have got bit on next island across cove on other side of bay put there on purpose for finest view of first bit only get arrangement know in isle of scilly isle of greece must be persuaded so took boat went to sea like three merchant of bristol city saw jerusalem madagascar very well if have turned up in nick of time believe must have seen river styx a well with cocytus very likely good old charon certainly tantalus too much punished overdone up to neck ' armorel heard wondering what in name of goodness talker of strange language might mean 'when oar broke know ' talker went on ' began to laugh so caught crab while lay in bottom laughing like tom of bedlam oar dropped overboard there be five mortal hour drifted have tobacco flask did mind so very much boat thought might pick up ' beome boat echoed armorel 'and outside samson 'as for rock never thought about have known of rock must not have laughed 'you have saved life said young man in velvet jacket have soft sweet voice trembled little a spoke indeed be solemn thing to be rescued from certain death 'peter did ' armorel replied may thank peter ' thank ' said softly persuasively 'the other man may thank peter ' a like so long be a remember that will have to be lesson to a long a live never to go out in boat without man will be lesson promise man go out with next time will not be dick ' went on enforcing lesson go in boat alone unless know water be plymouth tripper then plymouth people generally know how to handle boat 'we be from london ' in twilight blush caused by being taken for plymouth tripper be not perceived ' be artist came to sketch ' said with slight emphasis distinction there must be no mistaking artist from london for plymouth tripper 'you must be hungry 'we be ravenous at moment one can only feel that be better to be hungry alive than to be drowned dead ' said earnestly 'you know how strong water be must have thrown down rolled over over among rock head must have be knocked to piece face must have be crushed out of shape bone must have be broken peter have seen so ' 'ay ay ' said peter `` ve picked up just so be well off rock gentleman ' silence fell upon twilight be deepening breeze be chill armorel felt that young man beside be shivering perhaps with cold looked across dark water gasped 'we be coming up ' said 'out of gate of death jaw of hell strange to have be so near unto dying five minute more there must have be end two more men must have be created for other purpose to be drowned armorel made reply oar kept dipping dipping evenly steadily across water on hand flashed light st agnes bishop from south be white light from north crimson splendour of round island wind be dropping there be little phosphorescence on water gleamed along blade of oar in hour boat rounded new pier be in harbour of hugh town at foot of landing step ' said armorel 'you have better get home a fast a can have supper ' cried artist realising fact for first time 'you be bare headed will kill ' ' be used to going about bare headed will come to harm now go get food 'and ' young man stood on stepping stone ready to mount 'we will put up sail get back to samson in twenty minute there be breeze enough for ' 'will tell ' said artist 'before go to

there ought to know so much dorcas husband wife will know other doubt not if be only for man forgiveness after many cross rub 'twould be pity wife if did know other golden crown 'd be sorry to think be not about somewhere ' armorel listened without much interest wondered vaguely how dorcas must look in golden crown hoped that might not laugh when must be permitted to gaze upon thus wonderfully adorned then listened in silence while thinker followed up speculation on next world decree of heaven with freedom of kind strangely brutal freedom consigns without thought of pity majority of mankind to doom be too ignorant to realise too stupid to understand deceased lady be agreed might perhaps though be by mean certain have fallen under conviction of sin at remote period before of knew not since be certain a for husband be cut off in sin like roseveans struck down in sin without warning so that if old lady expected to meet after separation of nearly eighty year on shore of everlasting praise must certainly be disappointed because be otherwise situated disposed of therefore might just a well go up old wrinkled kind of talk be quite familiar to armorel generally meant nothing to right of private judgment be claimed freely exercised in scilly where branch of church catholic called bryanite greatly flourish formerly must have passed over talk without heeding now have begun to think of a well a of many other thing roland word on religious thing startled into thinking listened therefore wondering what view people like roland lee must take of great grandfather present condition of poor old lady prospect of meeting again then thought wandered from nebulous speculation heard more though conversation became lurid with flame of tartarus old religioners gloated over hopeless suffering of condemned sweet holy thing indeed have mankind made of gospel of great joy before separated chessun rose left room noiselessly armorel have experience of situation knew that something be going to be done something connected with impending funeral something solemn in fact chessun returned after ten minute quarter of hour others making pretence of expecting nothing

for small portion of year during summer month apple tree be now in blossom white pink flower bright in sunshine contrasting with grey lichen wrapped branch hung down like ribbon room be oldest part of house only remaining portion of earlier house be low small fireplace have never be modernised stood wide open with dog broad chimney window be of three narrow light one of must be opened be still provided with old diamond pane in leaden setting armorel observed muslin blind put up by dorcas to keep out prying eye in dull cloudy day room must be gloomy a be even with bright sunshine out of door air seemed cold oppressive perhaps from fresh association of death armorel shivered a looked about greater part of room be taken up by large bed in old lady time have curtain head thing at four corner like plume of hearse in faded crimson then looked splendid now bed have be stripped curtain plume be gone only skeleton bed left with four great solid post upper beam feather bed lying exposed with bare pillow case upon mattress bedstead be magnificent without trapping because be made of mahogany black with age no longer make such bedstead there be also table old black table with massive leg

silk dress arranged so a to present most extraordinary presentment of venerable lady much elongated without face seemed to be sitting in chair below peg dressed a usual nodding great bonnet pulled out to eight ten foot in length armorel caught ghostly similitude started trembling seemed a if in moment wrinkled old face with hawk like nose keen eye must come back to bonnet cap be so much startled that turned bonnet round then figure seemed watching with shoulder be uncanny be not so terrible a faceless form beside fireplace be cupboard one of huge cupboard one only find in old house armorel tried door be locked against wall stood chest of drawer brass bound massive tried handle lock be fast under window stood old sea chest be very big sea chest one must judge from rich carving ornamental ironwork that be probably sea chest of admiral at least perhaps of admiral hernando mureno armorel ancestor if such be rank in navy of catholic majesty sight of sea chest caused girl to shiver with fear of expectation nobody contemplates absolutely unknown without certain fear contained be certain thing dorcas have seen of must not speak chest seemed to drag cried 'open look inside see what have got to show ' then remembered a one in dream hearing people talk word long forgotten came back to 't be in hugh town whither went across to school when be a yet little girl have roseveans thus thus said voice with money have never spent anything have gone on saving saving day will find out what became of ' be going to find out what have become of old lady in most lucid moment have never dropped least hint of inheritance except disagreeable necessity of getting drowned on account of unfortunate robert fletcher be not inheritance to gladden heart yet there be inheritance be here in room be locked in alone in order that unseen by might discover what be baron bluebeard last wife who afterwards a beautiful rich lively young widow set so many heart aflame be not more curious than armorel be in course of investigation more afraid than armorel girl looked nervously about room so ghostly so full of shadow old room have ghost of have so many that one be not afraid of there be sense of companionship in crowd of ghost room have only one of woman who have grown old in who have spent nearly eighty year in old ghost have grown tired of monotonous room gone away left place to armorel not only 'believed in ghost many of accord to shadow shadowy theoretical belief actually knew that ghost do sometimes appear dorcas have seen many chessun while not going actually that length threw out hint have often too gone to look for now glanced nervously where 'things be hanging expecting to see ancestral figure reappear shoulder move bonnet cap turn round old old face within ready to warn to admonish to guide if have happened must have seemed to armorel nothing what be natural in regular course of thing looked for outside sun shone on white apple blossom one be very much afraid of ghost in sunshine encouraged with reflection began with unlocking chest of drawer lower drawer when be opened contained nothing 'things of great great grandmother among be box roughly made boy box made with jack knife contained gold watch with french name upon very old watch with representation of annunciation in low relief on gold face there be also in box two three gold chain sundry ring trinket

man who respected woman have corresponding quantity of flowered petticoat wine be by mean only thing laid down for future year accumulation helped to give solidity to appearance of life when woman thought of cupboard filled with fine linen man of cellar filled with wine uncertainty brevity of life alleged by preacher seemed not to concern must be absurd to lay down great bin of good port if one be not going to live long enough to drink fashion therefore have advantage armorel threw open door looked in place be so dark that be obliged to light candle in order to examine shelf running round side of cupboard there be strange smell in place perhaps have not be opened for long time bale of kind lay upon upper shelf armorel took down two opened contained silk strong rich silk rolled up put

be certain because armorel really felt richer than before yet array of punch bowl be truly imposing silver candlestick snuffer tankard cup ship though sadly wanted brush chamois leather with pinch of 'whitenin '' be worthy of college plate room one might surely feel little elation at thought of owning silver even if one did not understand intrinsic value like effect of champagne such elation must quickly wear off next armorel remembered secret cupboard at head of bed own bed have secret recess at head respectable bedstead used formerly to have where else must money be hidden away safely to be

ponderous in talk may say dull from genius one expects unexpected oh no little constrained in manner come from excessive sensibility dull oh 'he seemed dull at theatre last night 'it be curious

ourselves 'what be ' dear two can be so associated bound up in life of poet painter a to be for ever joined with name petrarch laura be not more closely connected than may be with alec feilding if only join with ' 'first tell what be plan of yours 'it be nothing le than just to relieve once for from business care business care 'they take up precious time weigh upon mind why must such man have business at to look after ' 'well ' said armorel refusing to rise to tempting bait doe man allow to have business care if worry ' 'it be conduct of journal dear other author painter conduct journal why must believe that successful writer artist make very large income if be so successful why doe trouble about managing paper be certainly work can be done by man of inferior brain 'you be so matter of fact dear paper be own think suppose that nobody must edit thing leave poor alec one two human weakness may think yet make allowance for own shrinking sensitive nature certainly armorel have seen indication in poet painter of shrinking nature be very carefully concealed 'of course ' zoe continued hardly know genius do know business worry be inseparable from journal be serious hindrance to higher work believe dear even if understand why must be so ' can very well believe only ask why mr feilding alone among author painter must hamper with such worry 'well dear there be have formed plan oh ' clasped hand opened eye wide plan best cleverest plan in world for best cleverest man in world want help ' can do ' will tell first of must remember that alec be sole proprietor a well a editor of journal mus nine be property created business management of paper worry plan armorel plan ' spoke looked most impressive 'will relieve altogether of work 'yes how do come into plan ' 'this way have found out through person of business that if must sell share say quarter eighth of paper must be able to put business part of into paid hand people who hing else now armorel will buy that share between will buy will advance whole of money will pay back price will be nothing to be will be great deal because investment will be such splendid thing return will be so brilliant will increase income enormously will have satisfaction paused because though be more animated earnest eloquent with voice eye though threw so much persuasion into manner tell tale face of girl showed kindling light of response at satisfaction ' continued feeling that help to literature art will make immortal armorel made reply be considering proposition coldly be one of thing must be considered without enthusiasm 'as for money ' continued with one more attempt to awaken responsive fire have found out what will be wanted for three thousand five hundred pound can get share in paper only three thousand five hundred pound be more than one thousand seven hundred fifty pound apiece will insist upon having share in investment because must grudge whole of work a for return have be well advised of of course alec be beyond paltry desire for gain might ask great deal more leaf everything to adviser oh dear must on account know yet who be doing for afterwards will break to gradually perhaps when have quite recovered from worry be rested if think of return ten twenty even fifty per cent may be expected a paper get on think of fifty per cent ' said armorel 'let too be above paltry desire for gain let who do want more money go in for business if advice be correct mr feilding can have difficulty at in selling share of paper people who want more money will be only too eager to buy ' bey dear

between woman detestable woman other walked home in doubt perplexity drove everything else out of head what did picture mean have roland given away sketch be there painter who have very touch of roland a well a sketch be impossible suddenly remembered something on fragment of paper that effie picked up corner of torn cheque even signature of alec feilding what did mean why have roland torn up cheque signed by mr feilding why have called that act turning of footstep chapter xi critic on truth one painter may make use of man sketch for own picture thing be conceivable though one can not recall there be record of such case be perhaps possible portrait painter have employed other men to paint background even hand drapery now two picture hanging in philippa room be most certainly painted from roland sketch if there be room for doubt figure of armorel in foreground removed that doubt therefore roland must have lent sketch to mr feilding what else did lend can one man lend eye

feminine verse be not byron thank however will take will keep value because think valuable suppose autograph verse of small poet be worth keeping still a value ' be very ungracious ungrateful be really tired of mr feilding praise after discovery of picture after strange story have heard only that morning wanted to hear more for present of praise of man cleverest man in london however unrolled paper began to read content at first carelessly then 'oh what be ' cried 'what be what ' asked mr elstree 'this be copy be same word a have used concerning picture remembered strange suspicion seized ' copy repeated wondering ' copy not at be verse be to appear in next number of journal number after next alec own verse of course sweetly pretty think what make say that be copied ' thought have seen

not fond of poetry failed to appreciate fine turn subtle tone felicitous phrase unexpected thought with poet delight reader in little poem must find nothing few jingling rhyme why must armorel behave so strangely 'what be dear ' asked again beomething remembered nothing of importance ' have alec said anything to have have wanted to make love to have offended by speaking ' 'no there have be question of love making between there never will be ' 'one can not say ' zoe looked at matter from experience 'one can never say men be strange creature alec certainly think great deal of ' ' can not

go to own room have thing to write mind ' bey dear child mind of course one must rather have company since must leave ' sank back in chair with sigh 'give that book dear if please french novel when one have be married one can read french novel without trying to conceal fact be mostly wicked sometimes witty not always good night dear will not expect back evening ' armorel in own room opened manuscript book of poem archie have given found very last of line have remembered laid precious autograph beside effie poem word for word comma for comma be exactly same there be not slightest difference again armorel thought of two picture then thought of little dainty volume in white parchment containing second series of 'voice echo by alec feilding ' have tossed aside impatient with man when zoe gave to now looked for found after little search opened side by side with effie manuscript book presently found page in effie book corresponded with first page of printed volume there be about thirty forty poem in little book in manuscript book there be double that number same poem followed other one after other in same order without difference of single word in book manuscript discovery justifies remark about common coincidence of daily life again armorel remembered that zoe possessed volume first series of 'voice echo by alec feilding ' be lying have seen in afternoon in drawing room went in search of returned without waking companion who have apparently fallen asleep over novel a matter of fact mr elstree be not sleeping be broad awake be curious desired to know what meant why armorel be suddenly struck with hardness why cheek burned eye flashed what wanted in drawing room perceived that armorel have come in search of alec first volume of verse oh alec first volume of verse now what might armorel want with book at end of march be light at about half past five everybody be then in soundest sleep at hour mr elstree came softly out of bedroom wrapped in dressing gown foot in soft slipper of white wool looked at book paper on table in armorel room there be manuscript volume of verse professing to be by one effie wilmot there be also two printed little volume bound in white gold containing verse by one alec feilding strange wonderful verse in book be exactly same mr elstree returned to bed thoughtful armorel for part when returned to own room compared first series of poem a have compared second with manuscript book first series too word for word be same a earlier poem in book heaven cried armorel 'the man steal verse a steal picture poor effie be a bad a roland ' be thought first one have already seen how three thought treated before time be just same thought second came next began to argue very capable logician be thought second once distinguished for what oxford men call science if said thought second manuscript volume agree seems to show effie have copied latter into own book now try to pas poem off a own such thing have be done if be case why not effie must be indeed girl full of deceit desperately wicked then how came effie to have in volume poem hitherto unpublished be lying on mr feilding table yet surely be quite a probable that girl must deceive a that man must deceive world next thought third sage remarked calmly 'the man be full of villany have deceived world in matter of picture why not also in matter of poem let consider character of verse take internal evidence ' then armorel read whole series right through in two little printed volume oh be feminine only woman must write line womanhood breathed in one now that key be supplied understood recognised voice eager passionate of friend 'they be effie ' cried again 'all man have stolen verse a well a picture discovery when have quite made up mind that be a true a former entirely fell in with effie have told concerning have sold poem to one editor be only editor who must ever take now be afraid that must take more why why because oh now understood

one never know whether will take to thing not to mind there be prospect of success in case young wilmot have shown that posse poetical dramatic power of very high order indeed seems most promising of men before at present be if keep up to standard of first effort e of course must discount of promise have heard for instance that husband lent advice assistance ' 'he said so after reading did not ' 'nobody know mr stephenson ' clasped hand turned eye of limpid blue upon young man many success husband have helped to make by timely assistance what did to particular play know of course during reading during yesterday performance seemed to hear voice through act haunted alec said nothing sat in silence smiling a if have never heard word before oh be wonderful now not word of recognition help people to climb up then pretend pretend to have got up by own exertion not that alec expects gratitude trouble much about thing naturally feel hurt oh mr stephenson what must be conscience of man how can bear to live who go about world pretending pretending ' shook head sadly 'pretending to have written other men work been will do anything suppose kind of assistance ought however to be recognised will make allusion to in notice of play meantime if can read future at master archie wilmot fortune be made will ' ber roland lee showed picture night have just come out of madhouse have not ' quite that failed dropped out what did with how lived for three year exactly know have returned never alludes to time ' exactly imitates husband be told ' 'no not exactly resemblance be close

invited to write for paper will be how do like paper have so completely changed character one must think that whole staff have be changed everybody read now everybody take believe ' circulation have gone up by leap bound be really wonderful mr stephenson here be one of reason give little credit poor can not write can look on have pair of eye can see thing now saw that alec be killing with writing week story also week poem week original article then note made stop said to stamp own individuality on line of paper write no longer edit see be not a if alec have to prove power have proved already so can afford to let others do hard work while add magic touch of genius that touch go to heart result see ' 'yes brightest cleverest most varied paper that exists ' 'with large staff formerly alec one two others formed whole staff well mr stephenson know that alec be going to ask to do of dramatic criticism if consent will be very pleased to have be first to mention ' will be understood from conversation that new method of managing business of firm be essentially different from old paper have taken new departure prospered be understood that editor put le of own work into article verse

be above even own estimate be soothing in fact note of salon be appreciation not mutual admiration a envious do enviously affirm moreover everybody in salon have done something perhaps not much something then place be one where talk be delightfully free almost a free a in club smoking room evening again there be kind of entertainment not too much because salon have to keep up reputation for conversation music destroys conversation 'let ' said mr feilding bevive dead art of conversation let men in room make reputation a did hundred year ago for brilliant talk ' have not heard that mr feilding have yet developed talker like mighty men of old perhaps one will come along later however who have looked into subject with ambition in line have ascertained nature of epigram repartee retort quip joke personal observation attributed to messrs douglas jerrold brilliant circle be doubtful of reviving that art except in modified greatly chastened even effeminate form entertainment provided by mr feilding consisted of little music little singing always by young little known professional there be generally something in fashion young lady with banjo tum tum anything be popular

looking at picture only see be not artist advanced to front bent forward considered few moment then spoke ' dexterous piece of work truly dexterous in highest sense full of observation intelligently poetically rendered careful truthful with intense feeling must hardly have believed that english painter be capable of work in genre ' people gazed upon canvas with rapt admiration murmured that be
