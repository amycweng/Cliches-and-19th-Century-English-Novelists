of non resistance be sound there may be case in just law may be justly set aside say not that be one a yet if there be danger of ancient superstition being thrust upon to destruction of soul say not that must meekly sit down nay if starving man take loaf of bread there being other way possible to save life one must not therefore hold thief yet law remains blood hath be poured out for cause of liberty prove to be shed in vain ' asked sir christopher 'why sir ' said rector same question might be asked in france where protestant fought longer against greater odds than in country yet blood of

into such enterprise yet never doubted that in end there must be uprising against rule of priest did doubt that king must be pushed on by adviser to one pretension after for advancement of own prerogative displacement of protestant church nay openly predicted that there must be such attempt maintained such be wisdom that in long run protestant faith must be established upon surer foundation than ever a for conspiring being cognisant of conspiracy be untrue why be at time seventy five year of age time when such men a sir christopher have continually before eye death judgment a for father perhaps be wrong in daily prayer of night morning in grace before meat seemed to find freer utterance to wrestle more vehemently than be wont on subject of scarlet woman offering a willing martyr

others to bring protestant king to throne of isle since knew to be so deep scholar always reading learning in sense man of activity thing presently did amazed yet ought to have known that one who be under divine command to preach word of god hath be silenced by man for more than twenty year so that strength of manhood hath run to waste be lost be most terrible grievous thing for man to be

owl once twice caused to tremble more than cold road when left highway be not often mended in part became narrow lane full of hole deep rut else track across open country barnaby knew way be about ten of clock when began journey be six in morning when finished suppose there be few woman who can boast of having taken so long ride in night yet strange to say felt desire to sleep be wearied with jogging of horse be sustained by something of spirit of father wonderful thing seemed to that simple country maid such a must help in putting down catholic king woman there have be who have played great part in history jael deborah judith esther for example must be called since then have discovered be not called indeed seemed truly wonderful then be going forth to witness array of gallant army about to fight for freedom for religion just a be arrayed forty year before when sir christopher be young man rode among brother stout barnaby be one of father be one of humphrey be one of in little while be very sure because robin must feel peace of mind if be with insurgent be still at home lover must be with too pictured to myself holy serious camp filled with godly sober soldier listening to sermon reading bible going forth to battle with hymn upon lip withal so valiant that at very first onset battalion of king must be shattered ala anyone may guess foolish thought of girl who have knowledge of world experience yet life have be taught that resistance be at time sacred duty that divine right of so called lord anointed be vain superstition so far therefore be better prepared than most woman for work in hand when rode through sherborne folk be bed street be empty from sherborne way lay through yetminster evershott to beaminster where watered rested horse took of barnaby provision country through rode be full of memory of last great war castle of sherborne be twice besieged once by lord bedford when marquis of hertford held for king that siege be raised be afterwards taken by fairfax with garrison of six hundred soldier be then destroyed so that be now heap of ruin a for beaminster town hath never recovered from great fire when prince maurice held be still half in ruin though ivy hath grown over blackened wall of burned house last great war of have heard so much now perhaps be about to begin be two o'clock in morning when dismounted at beaminster mother sat down upon bench fell instantly asleep father walked up down impatiently a grudging minute barnaby for part made leisurely comfortable meal eating bread meat of have drinking canary with relish a if be on journey of pleasure there be plenty of time for leisurely feeding presently arose with sigh food wine being gone said that horse being now rested might proceed so lifted mother into seat went on with journey day now breaking way say be never tedious to for be sustained by novelty strangeness of thing although have thousand thing to ask barnaby must be confessed that for one who have travelled so far have marvellous little to tell daresay that deck cabin of ship be much same whether be on spanish main in bristol channel sailor even in port be never observant race except of weather so forth be strange however only to look upon to mark how stout man be grown how strong yet how still spoke like old barnaby so good natured so dull with book who be daily flogged for latin grammar bore malice prepared to enjoy present when flogging be over not to anticipate certain repetition of flogging on morrow spoke in same slow way a if speech be thing too precious to be poured out quickly there be always sense in what said barnaby be only stupid in matter of syntax though gave not such answer a must have wished however confessed little by little something of history adventure when ran away be a thought to port of bristol where presently found berth a cabin boy on board west india man in truly enviable post everybody on board have cuff kick rope end for boy continued for time ' said barnaby 'you be not to think that rope end be so bad a father rod captain oath so bad a father rebuke rough work hard fare so bad a latin syntax ' being so strong hearty willing lad to boot be quickly promoted to be able seaman when there be more rope ending for then having ambition above station not liking rude ignorant companion of fo kbele be fore part of ship where common sailor sleep eat being so fortunate a to win good grace of supercargo first of captain next applied leisure time when have leisure to method of taking observation of calculating longitude latitude knowledge of arithmetic having fortunately stuck in mind longer than of latin thing understand be of greatest use to sailor necessary to officer armed with knowledge recommendation of superior barnaby be promoted from before mast became what call mate so rose by degree until be at last second captain by time have made many voyage to west indie to new york baltimore to west coast of africa in service of owner daresay have procured much wealth for though little for being at rotterdam upon owner business be easily persuaded being always stout protestant desirous to strike blow in revenge for ejection of father to engage a sailing master on board frigate brought over duke of monmouth company then to join on landing be sum of what have to tell have seen many strange people wonderful thing monster of deep indian whom cruelty avarice of spaniard have well nigh destroyed sugar plantation in island negro slave negro free in own country shark calamary of have read heard have seen thing still remained in mind mean a if have seen nothing so wonderfully made be men whatever see be in way moved say then that barnaby answered question a rode along briefly a if such matter troubled not when asked for example how poor miserable slave liked being captured sold put on board ship crowded together for so long voyage barnaby replied that did not know business being to buy carry across water if rebelled on board ship to shoot down flog when got to jamaica to sell where if must not work must be flogged until came to better mind if man be born negro what else asked must expect there be one question greatly desired to ask dared not concerned welfare of soul presently however barnaby answered that question before put beister said bey mother constant affliction concerning before ran away be a to salvation of soul truly formerly seemed to so difficult thing to compass like navigation to unknown port over unknown sea set everywhere with hidden rock liable to sudden gust must not understand how plain man must ever succeed in wherefore comforted mightily after got to sea to learn on good authority that there be way compared with father be light easy in short sister though know not there be one religion for land folk for sailor folk sailor everybody know can not get so much a sail bent without cursing swearing be desperately wicked ashore count for nothing at afloat so with many other thing long short of be that if sailor doe duty fight ship like man be true to owner faithful to messmate matter not one straw whether hath daily sworn great oath drunk whenever went ashore a helpless a log kissed pretty girl whenever good luck gave chance doe indeed seldom come to most sailor added with deep sigh say sister for sailor when ship go down with when get grapeshot through vitals when dy of fever a happens often enough in hot climate there be question a to safety of soul go straight to heaven what be ordered to do when get there ' said barnaby ' can not say will be something doubt not that sailor will like to do catechism latin syntax wherefore sister can set mother heart poor soul quite at rest on important matter can tell that have conversed with have very same inward assurance of father speaks so much at such length very same assurance be tell beg to ask question upon matter 'well barnaby art thou sure 'it be heavenly comfort ' replied before have time to finish 'to have assurance for why man hath doth never more trouble about what will happen to after be dead therefore go about duty with easy mind so sister more upon head if love desire peace of mind for mother ' so nothing more be said upon subject then afterwards sailor to be exempted by right of calling from religion of landsman 't be strange dangerous doctrine if sailor believe yet how can be question confess be too high for a for mother gave barnaby message begging at same time not to question further sighed obeyed presently barnaby asked if have money have none knew that mother must have little of course father never have doubt if have possessed single penny since ejection 'well said barnaby ' thought to give money to mother now perceive that if have will give to dad if have will give to duke for cause wherefore sister do take keep not for to be expended a seemeth best ' lugged out of pocket heavy bag 'here be money have saved in ten year nay be not a sailor one can not keep penny in purse must need fling away here be two hundred fifty gold piece take alice hang bag round thy neck never part with day night say nothing about money to mother to dad for will assuredly do with a have said time may come when thou wilt want ' two hundred fifty gold piece be possible that barnaby must be so rich took bag hung round waist not neck by string have tied above neck a be covered by mantle nobody ever suspected that have treasure in end a will hear seemed to be useful be now broad daylight sun be up a drew near bridport there stood man in road armed with halbert go ye good people asked 'what be business ' said barnaby flourishing oaken staff ride upon own business stand aside thou mayest henceforth have more business to do upon earth ' on then ride on ' replied standing aside with great meekness be one of guard whom posted everywhere upon road in order to stop people who be flocking to camp in way many be sent back many be arrested on way to join monmouth now a drew near to bridport time being about four o'clock heard firing of gun great shouting 'they have begun fighting said barnaby ' knew must not be long coming ' be in fact first engagement when dorsetshire militia be driven out of bridport by duke troop there must have be signal victory at very outset for cowardice of lord grey who ran away with horse well be strange wonderful thing to think that close at hand be men killing other on sabbath yea lying wounded on road that civil war have again begun 'let push on ' said 'out of way of troop be country lad of if retreat will run if run will be seized with panic will run way back to lyme trampling on everything be in road be sound advice followed taking upper track brought into high road mile so nearer charmouth think there can be anywhere finer road than run from

have expected beister said barnaby 'this be godly religious place to wisdom of dad hath brought thee perhaps meaneth thee to lie in open like lad 'where be duke asked father looking wrathfully at reveller sabbath breaker duke lie at george inn ' said barnaby ' will show way ' in blue parlour of george duke be at time holding council there be different report a to bridport affair already be said that lord grey be unfit to lead horse having be first to run away said that militia be driven out of town in panic that made stand that men have fled know not what be truth now matter little except that first action of men brought little honour when council be finished duke sent word that must receive dr challis be humphrey dr comfort eykin so be introduced to presence of grace first father a humphrey told fell into kind of ecstasy praising god for landing of duke foretelling such speedy victory a must lay enemy of country at foot then drew forth roll of paper in have set down for information of duke estimated number of disaffected in town of south west of england with name of such a must be trusted not only to risk own body estate in cause must stir up encourage friend there be so many on list that duke eye brightened a read beir ' said 'if report can be depended upon be indeed made men what be opinion dr challis ' opinion sir be that be name of friend well wishers if see grace well supported at outset will flock in if not many of will stand aloof ' sir christopher join ' asked duke sir be now seventy five year of age ' duke turned away presently returned to list asked

farewell to lovely hero gracious duke trouble that man mind can conceive be permitted to be rained upon head defeat wound death prison nay for thing a one must have expected even feared such fate a never entered mind of man to invent when duke marched out of bridgwater across sedgemoor to glastonbury weather have be hot fine became cold rainy made men uncomfortable at glastonbury camped in ruin of old abbey thence went to shepton mallet spirit of men still being high from shepton mallet marched to place called pensford only five mile from bristol here heard that bridge over avon at keynsham be broken down being presently repaired army marched across be then within easy reach of bristol now began disaster of enterprise up to time everything have prospered have duke boldly attacked bristol speak not of own wisdom having none in such matter from others wisdom must have encountered more than twenty company thereabouts of militia regiment of two hundred fifty horse moreover bristol be full of dissenter who wanted nothing encouragement to join protestant champion not only duke friend also enemy agree in declaring that wanted nothing courage to take great rich populous city where must have found everything that wanted men money arm ammunition can not think that for sin for sin of nation judicial blindness be caused to fall upon duke so that chose of two way open to that led to destruction in short turned away from bristol drew up force against bath when summoned that city to surrender shot herald scoffed at then instead of taking town duke retired to philip norton where 't be said expected great reinforcement none came now grew greatly dejected showing dejection in face must conceal nothing yet fought action with half brother duke of grafton in be victorious thing ought to have helped in action lieutenant blake miss blake cousin be killed from philip norton army marched to frome here such be general despondency two thousand men third of whole army deserted in night returned to own home think also be at frome that learned news of lord argyle discomfiture then council be held at be proposed that army must be disbanded ordered to return seeing that king have proclaimed pardon to who must peacefully lay down arm return home that duke with lord grey who must be certainly exempted from that pardon must make best of way out of country ala here be way open to safety of poor men again be duke permitted to choose other way that namely led to destruction of army yet say that recommended safer course must have known that wanted arm ammunition that men be deserting that more recruit came in colonel venner one of principal men be at juncture sent away to holland in order to get assistance in arm money king proclamation of pardon be carefully kept from knowledge of soldier on july th army returned to bridgwater now dr hooke chaplain to army of officer be sent away secretly in order to raise insurrection in london elsewhere only hope being rising in various part must call away of king force from west of taunton men in army rode from bridgwater to see friend woman who for most part remained at home learned news save that a yet there have be signal victory did not hear of large desertion of duke despondency therefore continued in fool paradise looked day for great crowning mercy who be on side of lord be always expecting special interference whereas ought to be satisfied with being on right side whether victory defeat be intended for in enterprise doubt not that godly men there be dare say godly men who fell in battle be afterwards executed received reward that far far greater reward than conduct deserved for who can measure short agony of death beside everlasting life of glory joy unspeakable last day of fatal expedition be sunday fifth day of july so that took more than three week in between first beginning failure only three week how much longer be before punishment expiation be concluded nay be even yet concluded when thousand of innocent woman child still go in poverty mourning for loss of who must have worked for in morning father preached to soldier on text joshua xxii 'the lord god of god lord god of god

straightway to bridgwater duty fellow promised most faithfully performed duke have already learned approach of lord feversham being now wellnigh desperate with continued loss seeing army gradually wasting away with fresh recruit have resolved upon not waiting to be attacked on retreat northward hoping to get across bridge at keynsham so march into shropshire cheshire where still hoped to raise army say who hath helped with brief account of expedition retreat must have be harassed by lord feversham horse must have turned into flight men must have deserted in direction when remains of army arrived at keynsham bridge must certainly have found occupied by duke of beaufort carriage be already loaded in readiness for march be to begin at when arrival of man godfrey news that brought caused duke to change everything for now perceived that chance be offered a have never before occurred since landing viz night surprise if be fortunate rout of king best troop be said that have duke shown same boldness in matter of bristol that showed in night attack must have gained that city first own cause next did appear at desperate attempt for though lord feversham have men with horse foot with sixteen field piece duke have nearly foot counting armed with pike scythe horse with four field piece though king troop included many company of grenadier with battalion of famous regiment coldstream guard hundred horse of king regiment dragoon duke have with at least men well armed resolute a event showed besides have advantage of surprise confusion of night attack in addition camp be not entrenched trooper have gone to bed foot soldier be drinking cider officer be reported to be drunk therefore be resolved that intended flight into shropshire must be abandoned that whole matter must be brought to issue very night have attack succeeded might yet have gone well with duke enemy boasted that raw country lad must be routed at first charge of regular soldier if proved contrary who have deserted must have returned who held aloof must join be not cause found men lukewarm be doubt nothing doubt whether duke enterprise must be supported never heard that found aught commendation of

even if there happen darker hour than in everything by prayer supplication with thanksgiving let request be made known with thanksgiving daughter ' ala must not obey apostolic order 't be too much for so fell into silence when sun have quite gone down barnaby went forth cautiously presently came back 'there be one on road said 'we may now go on way air of taunton be dangerous to breed swift fatal disease have now resolved what to do will lift father upon cart again put in pony four five mile sou west thereabouts be black down be man land thither will go hide in comb where one ever come except gipsy 'how will live barnaby ' 'that ' said will find out when come to look about there be provision for two day night be warm will find cover make with branch there be water in brook dry wood to burn there may perhaps be safe when country be quiet will make way across hill to bradford orca where one will molest can go off to bristol lyme wherever there be ship to be found when sailor be shipwrecked begin by asking what will do on dry land ask only to feel stone beneath foot must think of nothing now of place of safety 'barnaby be open hill proper place for wounded man child for choice between hill what else may happen if stay here give hill even for wounded man indeed ' whispered so that mother must not hear 'he will die death be written on face know not how long will live must die never did man recover from such evil plight harnessed pony to cart be little more than couple of plank laid side by side laid father upon just a have brought from taunton mother made kind of pillow for with grass tied up in kerchief so hoped that must not feel jogging of cart stream ' said barnaby 'comes down from hill let follow course upwards be broad stream with willow bed for most part flat pebbly on side of stream lay strip of soft turf broad enough for cart to run upon so that a long a lasted have very easy going mother walking one on side so a to steady pillow keep poor head upon from pain whether went easy whether went rough head made sign of feeling aught lay just a in linney a if dead can not tell how long went on beside that stream 't be in wild uncultivated country ground ascended stream became narrower swifter presently friendly strip of turf failed altogether then have trouble to keep cart from upsetting went to pony head barnaby going behind cart lifted over rough place sometimes carried end of night be chilly foot be wet with splashing in brook be growing faint with hunger when barnaby called halt be now said 'at head of stream in hour thereabouts will be break of day let rest mother must eat something come sister 't be late for supper full early for breakfast take meat bread cup of cider be remember of night chapter xxiv camp in comb camping place when awoke in morning found to be near head of most beautiful comb valley among black down hill knew not at time be not far from old roman stronghold have passed on way to taunton called castle ratch hill on somerset side be of gentle gradual slope valley be not deep yet where lay so grown over with tree a to afford complete shelter hiding place while at foot brook took rise in green quagmire began to make way downwards among fern bush through wild uncultivated country beyond farm field began bird be singing sun be already high air be warm though there be fresh breeze blowing warmth sweetness filled soul when awoke sat up with joy until suddenly remembered why be here who be here with then heart sank like lump of lead in water looked around father lay just a have be lying day before motionless white of cheek a one dead save for slight motion of chest twitching of nostril a looked at in clear morning light be borne in upon very strongly that be indeed dead inasmuch a soul seemed to have fled saw nothing felt nothing if fly crawled over eyelid made sign of disturbance yet breathed from time to time murmured a one dreameth beside lay mother sleeping worn out by fatigue of night barnaby have spread coat to cover so that must not take cold have piled little heap of dead leaf to make pillow be lying at foot head on arm sleeping heavily what must be done wondered when next woke first went down comb little way till stream be deep enough there bathed foot be swollen bruised by long walk up comb though be in midst of so much misery there be pleasure of dabbling foot in cool water afterwards of walking about barefoot in grass disturbed adder be sleeping on flat stone in sun lifted venomous head hissed did not spring upon then washed face hand made hair a a without comb be possible when have done remembered that perhaps father might be thirsty at least able to drink though seemed no more to feel hunger thirst so filled tin pannikin be barnaby with water tried to pour little into mouth seemed to swallow gave little more until must swallow more observe that took other nourishment than little water wine milk few drop of until end so covered face with handkerchief to keep off fly left then looked into basket that there be in must not be more than enough for barnaby breakfast unless appetite must fail by reason of fear though in truth have fear being captured of anything else there be in piece of bacon large loaf of bread lump of cheese bottle of cider nothing more when provision be gone what next must venture into nearest village buy food to first farm house then might fall straight into jaw of enemy who be probably running over whole country in search of fugitive must buy without money must beg without arousing suspicion if people be well inclined to protestant cause might trust how must tell so in mind turned over everything except one thing might have proved salvation that will hear directly also be very strange thing quite forgot that have upon tied by string round waist well concealed barnaby bag of gold two hundred fifty piece thus there be money enough to spare discovered next pony have run away in night cart be there pony to drag well be not much seemed additional burden to bear ventured little way up valley following sheep track mounted higher higher saw sign anywhere of man presence take be marked in wood by circle of burnt cinder by tree felled by bundle of broom fern tied up by shepherd hut here there be nothing at must have said that place have never be visited by man presently came to place where wood ceased last of tree being much stunted blown over from west then top of hill began not sharp pico point great open plain flat swelling out here there with many of little hillock people say be ancient tomb tree at only bare turf so one must see great way off there be sign of man anywhere smoke in comb at foot shepherd on hill at juncture of fortune stranger might be enemy therefore returned so far well pleased barnaby be now awake be inspecting basket of provision said must go upon half ration for breakfast hope unless skill fails to bring something better for supper bread will have mother bacon may keep till to morrow cider have better keep against such time a feel worn out want cordial though glass of nantz be better if nantz grew in wood looked around a if to see whether miracle must not provide with flask of strong drink seeing none shook head 'as for ' went on ' be sailor understand how to forage therefore yesterday foreseeing that provision might give out dropped shank of ham into pocket now will see produced delicate morsel sitting down began to gnaw to bite into bone with strong teeth exactly like dog continued with sign of satisfaction for quarter of hour so when desisted replaced bone in pocket throw away bone said 'the dog gnaw devour think that be for amusement not so for juice nourishment be in around bone for marrow for meat still will stick in odd corner went down to stream with pannikin drank cup two of water to finish what called horse meal namely food first water afterwards now added ' have breakfasted be true that be still hungry have eaten enough to carry on for while many poor lad cast away on desert shore must find shank of ham meal fit for king aye meal two after will make dinner presently off bone will still keep against time when there may be provision left then looked about shading eye with hand consider ' said 'the trooper take be riding along road whether will ride over hill know not think will not because horse can not well get up comb certainly if do will not be by way came be here therefore hidden away snug why must budge nowhere be there more deserted part of country than black down on whose side be think further that must find anywhere safer place to hide in than comb where dare to say one come unless be gipsy broom squire year round now be laden with spoil of army for after battle gentry swoop down upon field like great bird have seen abroad upon carcase of drowned beast plunder dead next must go into town in order to sell booty then will be fain to drink about till be spent so will leave undisturbed therefore will stay here sister first will go try old trick by did often in old time improve fare at home next will devise way of making more comfortable resting place thank lord for fine weather so far ' be gone couple of hour during time mother awoke mind be broken by suddenness of trouble cared more to speak sitting still by side of husband watching for change in persuaded to take little bread cup of cider when barnaby came back brought with blackbird thrush two wood pigeon have not forgotten trick of boyhood when must often bring home rabbit hare basket of trout so that chief terror that might be forced to abandon hiding place through sheer hunger be removed barnaby be full of kind of device then set to work with great knife cutting down quantity of green branch laid out side by side with leaf on then bound together cleverly interlacing smaller shoot branch with other so that made long kind of hurdle about six foot high by reason of leaf be almost impervious to wind disposed round trunk of three young tree growing near other thus made small three cornered inclosure again cut other thicker branch laid over across hurdle cut turf placed upon branch so that here be now hut with roof wall complete said not that barnaby be full of device ' said when be ready 'be house for will have to rain hard long before water begin to drop through branch make roof slab of turf well 't be shelter not so comfortable a old cottage perhaps nearly a commodious if be not palace will serve to keep off sun by day dew by night ' next gathered great quantity of dry fern dead leaf heather disposed within hut so that made thick warm carpet covering nay at night even formed covering for foot prevented one from feeling cold when be done lifted father gently laid with great tenderness upon carpet within rude shelter will be warmer night for thee than last dad said 'there will be jolting of thy poor bone what mother can live here till cold weather come wind will perhaps blow bit through leaf to night not much to morrow will see to be easy in mind about provision ala poor mother be thinking of anything in world except provision 'there be rabbit bird in plenty can catch eat bread must do without when what have be gone a for strong drink tobacco ' sighed heavily 'they will come again when better time be served out ' in labour helped a much a be able particularly in twisting branch together thus whole day passed not tediously without alarm labour being cheered by hopefulness of barnaby honest face one to look at face must believe that be flying for life must be hanged if be caught after sunset lit fire small one only well hidden by wood so that light might not be seen from below then barnaby dexterously plucked trussed bird roasted in ember so have heart be at rest must have have most delicious supper confess did begin to pluck up little courage to hope that might yet escape robin might be living after supper mother prayed must join with more of resignation something of faith ala in time of trial how easily doth christian fall from faith day before prayer seemed to mockery be a if prayer be addressed to deaf god to one who will not hear for prayer have be for safety victory be suddenly answered with disaster defeat after supper barnaby sat beside ember began to talk in low voice `` twill be sorrowful barley mow song year said ' dozen

to vivify spirit so to act upon nerve a to restore sinking to call back to life man almost moribund remembering lugged packet out of pocket laid on table 'be of good cheer cousin ' said have drug be strong enough with help of god to make dying man sit up again courage then when have said word temptation fell upon came in guise of voice whispered in ear behould man die said 'there will be freedom for alice can then marry man love will be restored to happiness while life must still continue in misery being cut off from love let die therefore 'humphrey said ben 'in matter of alice if will come
