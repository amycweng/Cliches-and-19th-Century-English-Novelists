remarkable coincidence be on very evening that iris first made acquaintance of pupil mr arnold arbuthnot coincidence believe happen oftener in real life than do even on stage where people be always turning up at very nick of time critical moment need little persuasion to make believe that first meeting of arnold arbuthnot iris on very evening when cousin be opening matter with foxy one be nothing short of providential will see presently what thing might have happened if have not met meeting be in fact second of three really important event in life of girl first be seldom remembered with gratitude deserves be birth second first meeting with future lover third wedding day other event of woman life be interesting perhaps not important certain circumstance will be immediately explained connected with meeting made event of very considerable interest to iris even though did not suspect immense importance so much interest that thought of nothing else for week beforehand a appointed hour drew near trembled grew pale that when grandfather came up for tea who be usually so quick to discern least sign of care anxiety in face actually did not observe trouble plainly written in drooping head anxious eye be due to interview with mr david chalker poured out tea therefore without one word of sympathy must have seemed hard if grandfather have expected did not however because did not know that trouble showed in face be trying to look a if nothing have happened yet in brain be ringing resounding word within three week within three week with regularity of horrid clock at midnight when one want to go to sleep oh cried iris forced a young people always be to speak of own trouble oh grandfather be coming to night who be coming to night dear then listened again for ticking of clock within three week within three week who be coming to night dear took cup of tea from sat down with old man deliberation spring le from wisdom fullness of thought that from respect to rheumatism iteration of refrain within three week made forget everything even trouble of granddaughter mind oh grandfather can not have forgotten spoke with least possible touch of irritation because have be thinking of thing for week past day night be thing of such stupendous interest to that seemed impossible that anyone who knew of must forget what be coming no no old man be stimulated into immediate recollection by disappointment in eye dear have not forgotten pupil be coming mr arbuthnot be coming iris child let that worry will see for if like must see see dear there be awful deception oh how will tell deception at said stoutly advertised in own initial never asked if initial belonged to man to woman other pupil know why must one doe matter to if have done work for engaged service oh be so different others know keep to subject so must then why did have have be answering must think be drawing on to tell more about now oh what will think drew on on yet did mean to till at last writes to say that regard a best friend wisest adviser have ever have what will think say grandfather be dreadful what did tell for iris dear why must let thing go on by telling will lose pupil yes of course worse still will lose letter live so quietly here that letter have come to like news of world how many different world be there round one in london have be pleasant to read of one in lady go about beautifully dressed always where people have nothing to do to amuse have told about world in life about own life so know everything doe where go here sighed heavily of course must not go on forever must not mind so much if have not be carried on under false pretense false pretense at dear think sent back last check said trying to find little consolation for herself yet well iris said grandfather wanted to learn heraldry have taught for last three month girl blushed a if be confessing sin for last three month there have not be single word in letter about heraldry tell that writes because be idle because want to talk because be alone in studio because want unknown friend advice be unknown friend have be giving advice very good advice too said grandfather benevolently who be so wise a iris have answered letter never once told that be only girl be glad did not tell iris said grandfather did not say why be glad why ca go on writing letter without making fuss because say must make acquaintance of man man say with whom have be in correspondence so long be what say opened letter lay upon table covered with paper grandfather stopped well dear want to know what say wish to make acquaintance very good then be going to see to tell who be be enough a for deceiving paused trying to understand extreme scrupulosity of conscience if come to deceiving well in kind sort of way did allow to think correspondent man admit that what harm be done to none wo be so mean suppose a to ask for money back again think ought to have back said iris yes from very beginning be ashamed that ever took money from face burn when think of to grandfather made reply returning of money paid for service rendered be to commercial mind too foolish thing to be even talked about at same time iris be quite free to manage own affair then there be that roll of paper in safe why what matter if sent away pupil changed subject iris dear said about other world where people amuse world life in square in big house on chelsea embankment here know how must like just for change to belong to world have work to do know replied carelessly because question did not interest must have to leave of course must sever connection a say with shop please let talk nonsense grandfather must have to be ashamed perhaps of ever having taught for living now that never must be never not if made duchess must go dressed in silk velvet dear must like to see dressed up just for once a have seen at theater well must like one velvet dress in life only one must be crimson beautiful deep dark crimson very good must drive in carriage instead of omnibus must sit in stall instead of upper circle must give quantity of money to poor people must buy a many second hand book a pleased there be rich people believe ostentatious people who buy new book dear have be better brought up book be worth buying till have stood criticism of whole generation at least never buy new book dear wo said iris dear old man what have got in head to night why in world must talk about getting rich be only thinking said that perhaps might be so much happier happier nonsense be a happy a can be six pupil already to be sure have lost one sighed best among when grandfather left iris placed candle on writing table did not light though be already pretty dark have hour to wait wanted to think candle be not necessary for meditation sat at open window suffered thought to ramble where pleased be restful thing to do especially if window look upon tolerably busy not noisy london road for then be almost a good a sitting beside swiftly running stream movement of people below be like unceasing flow of current sound of footstep be like whisper of water along bank echo of half heard talk strike ear like mysterious voice wafted to bank from boat a go by light of shop street presently become spectral unreal like light seen upon river in evening iris have good many pupil six in fact a have boasted why then be so strangely disturbed on account of one old tutor by correspondence may be very likely be indifferent about pupil because have have so many iris be young tutor have a yet known few one of pupil for instance be gentleman in fruit potato line in borough by reason of early education have not be neglected so much a entirely omitted be unable to personally conduct account now merchant without account be a helpless a tourist without cook so that desired in mature age to learn book keeping compound addition subtraction multiplication have partner so that did not want division be difficult say well nigh impossible for middle aged merchant not trained in grace of letter writing to inspire young lady with personal regard even though be privileged to follow current of thought day by day to set sum next there be young fellow of nineteen twenty who be beginning life a assistant teacher in commercial school at lower clapton way be stony thorny path to tread one walk upon willingly who be compelled to enter upon speedily run away enlist go find secluded spot in to hang smoother way of profession be only to be entered by one who be possessor of degree be determination of young man to pas london university examination to obtain degree of bachelor in way value in educational market must be at once doubled must command better place lighter work showed in letter to be eminently practical shrewd selfish thick skinned young man who must quite certainly get on in world be resolved to lose opportunity with view took a much work out of tutor a must get for money have known that ia who took wonderful amount of trouble with paper be only woman must certainly have extorted great deal more work for money iris read in letter understood there be way in man more surely more naturally reveals true character than in correspondence so after awhile even though subject of letter be nothing more interesting than study in hand who write letter may learn to know other if have mother wit to read between line certainly young schoolmaster did not know iris did desire to discover what be like being wholly occupied with study of strange kindly provision of nature le desirable man actually appears to others more fondly love belief in have heard whispered that narcissus be hunchback then there be pupil girl who be working very hardest in order to become a hoped first class governess who poor thing by reason of natural thickness must never reach even third rank iris must have be sorry for because worked so fiercely be so stupid there be something hard unsympathetic in nature forbade pity be miserably poor too have unsuccessful father no doubt a stupid a herself made pitiful excuse for not forwarding slender fee with regularity everybody who be poor must be on ground alone worthy of pity sympathy hardness stupidity ill temper combined clearly shown in letter repelled tutor iris who drew imaginary portrait of pupil pictured girl a plain to look upon with dull eye leathery pallid cheek forehead without sunshine upon lip seldom parted with smile then there be besides cambridge undergraduate be clever industrious very ambitious thought that moderate place be quite good enough for to aim at found that unknown obscure tutor by correspondence be cheap obliging willing to take trouble quite a efficacious for purpose a most expensive cambridge coach iris presently discovered that be lazy luxurious deceiver of dweller in fool paradise constant shirker of work therefore disliked have actually known talked with might have liked better in spite of fault shortcoming for be really pleasant easygoing youth who wallowed in intellectual sloth loved physical activity who will presently drop easily comfortably without effort doubt into bosom of church will develop later on into admirable country parson unless disestablish establishment in case know what will do other man man who be coming for explanation mr arnold arbuthnot be if please very different kind of pupil in first place be gentleman fact displayed not ostentatiously in line of letter next have come to for instruction only pupil have in science in heraldry loved be far more pleasant to be describing shield settling question in queer old language of queer old science than in solving propounding problem in trigonometry conic section then how if pupil begin to talk round subject to wander into other thing can not very well talk round branch of mathematics heraldry be subject surrounded by field meadow lawn so to speak covered with beautiful flower into pupil wandered iris not unwillingly followed thus teaching of heraldry by correspondence became most delightful interchange of letter imaginable set off enriched with curious strange piquancy derived from fact that one of supposed to be elderly man be young girl ignorant of world except from book advice given by two old men who formed society then a be natural what be at first kind of play became before long serious earnest confidence on one side hesitating reception on other latterly more than once amused by drawing imaginary portrait of be pleasing portrait made feel uneasy know said from letter yet want to know in person think be man advanced in year poor iris not yet twenty one sit in study read wear glass hair be gray have kind heart cheerful voice be not rich have never tried to make rich be therefore little versed in way of mankind take idea chiefly from book few friend have chosen be true loyal be full of sympathy quick to read thought of in whom take interest very fine character made iris cheek to burn eye to drop to be sure be not rich did know world so far pupil be right yet be not gray old again be not a thought man letter writing be not extinct a be commonplace to affirm a people must have believe letter be written still most delightful letter letter a copious a charming a of last century men woman no longer write letter a carefully a used to do in old day because be then shown about very likely read aloud letter therefore though sentence be not so balanced period so rounded be more real more truthful more spontaneous more delightful than laborious production of ancestor who have to weigh phrase to think out bon mot epigram smart thing for week beforehand so that letter might appear full of impromptu wit must like for instance just for once to rob outward homeward mail in order to read delightful letter go week backward forward between folk in india folk at home will lose letter iris recollected heart sunk not only did correspondent begin to draw imaginary portrait of proceeded to urge upon to come out of concealment to grant interview might have refused in desire to continue correspondence brightened monotonous life there came thing decided began to give to ask opinion concerning love marriage such topic then perceived must not possibly be discussed with even in domino male disguise a for love pupil wrote suppose be real not fancied necessity of life man mean may go on long time without there will come time think so when be bound to feel incompleteness of life without woman to love ought to train boy girl from very beginning to regard love marriage a only thing really worth having because without there be happiness give own experience be sure must have be in love at time other in life anybody will understand iris must not possibly give own experience in love matter must plunge into speculative philosophy of kind with pupil obviously thing must come to end therefore wrote letter to telling that ia must meet if pleased that very evening at hour of eight be by time sufficiently understood that iris aglen professed to teach be unusual combination mathematics heraldry might also have taught equally well have chosen sweetness of disposition goodness of heart benefit conferred by pure lofty thought on expression of girl face way to acquire other gracious maidenly virtue there be too limited market for branch of culture be perhaps truer reason there be so many english girl not to speak of american who be ready competent to teach do teach to brother lover to other to younger sister day long a for heraldry be natural that must acquire science because grandfather knew a much a pursuivant king at arm thought that by teaching child science be nowadays cultivated by so few be going to make fortune besides ever mindful of secret packet thought that heiress ought to understand heraldry be indeed a will see in way that fortune be made yet not quite in way proposed to make nobody ever make fortune quite in way at first intended for a for mathematics be wonder that be good in science because be pupil of lala roy learned bengalee condescended to acknowledge study of mathematics a worthy even of indian intellect amused with when be not more usefully engaged in chess be who being lodger in house taught iris almost a soon a must read how letter placed side by side may be made to signify accomplish stupendous thing how may disguise most graceful beautiful curve how may even open way into boundless space there disclose marvel wondrous world did philosopher open to ready quick witted girl did ever lead to believe that be at unusual extraordinary thing for girl to be so quick apt for science a did tell that if went to newnham to girton extraordinary glory must await with acclamation of multitude in senate house praise of moderator iris therefore be not proud of mathematics seemed part of very nature of heraldry be fear extremely proud proud even to sinfulness doubt be reason why through heraldry humiliation of evening fell upon if be young thought if be young be sure to be young will be very angry at having opened mind to girl will be perceived that although knew so much mathematics be really very ignorant of opposite sex not to know that young man like nothing so much a opening of mind to young lady if be old will be more humiliated still a if man at age be ever humiliated by confessing to woman if be proud man will never forgive indeed be sure that can never forgive kind of man be can do more than tell be sorry if will not forgive then what more can say oh if must be vindictive when clock began to strike hour of eight iris lighted candle before pulsation of last stroke have died away heard ringing of house bell door be opened by grandfather heard voice yes said will find tutor in first floor front alone if be inclined to be vindictive when hear please ring bell for visitor mounted stair iris hearing step began to tremble to shake for fear when door opened did not at first look up knew that pupil be there that be looking for tutor pardon voice be not unpleasant pardon be directed to room have appointment with tutor if said iris rising for time for confession have at length arrived if be mr arnold arbuthnot appointment be believe with be with tutor said be tutor initial be ia room be only lighted by two candle showed hanging head form of woman thought looked young judging by outline voice be sweet clear tutor if really be mr arnold arbuthnot gentleman who have corresponded with ia for last two year on heraldry other thing be tutor have made dreaded confession rest must be easy even ventured to raise eye perceived with sinking of heart that estimate of pupil age be tolerably correct be young man apparently not more than five six twenty now remained to be seen if be vindictive a for pupil when recovered little from blow of announcement saw before girl quite young dressed in simple gray drab colored stuff have reason to believe be called carmelite dress have crimson kerchief arranged in fold over front lace collar at first sight made beholder feel that considered merely a setting of face figure be remarkably effective surely be true end aim of feminine adornment apart from elementary object of keeping one warm did not know young man said after pause did not know at be corresponding with lady here raised eye again observed that eye be very large full of light eye like fishpools of heshbon dove eye be very sorry said meekly be fault observed other thing now having regained use of sens thus saw that wore hair be of wonderful chestnut brown color parted at side like boy that have not committed horrible enormity of cutting short observed too that while lip be quivering cheek be blushing look be steadfast be dove eye asked always steadfast ought to have told long ago when began to write about about other thing when understood that thought be man oh long ago ought to have told truth be wonderful said young man be truly wonderful be thinking of letter long letter full of sympathy curious unworldly wisdom have sent in reply to own be comparing with youthful face a one involuntarily compare poet appearance with poetry generally disappointing thing to do always foolish thing be very sorry repeated have many pupil like have several pupil in mathematics doe not matter to whether be taught by man woman in heraldry have only one looked round room one end be occupied by shelf filled with book in one of window be table covered with paper adorned with type writer by mean of iris carried on correspondence for moment unworthy thought crossed mind that have be perhaps artfully lured on by siren for destruction only for moment however because raised face met gaze again with eye so frank innocent that must not doubt besides there be clear outline of face so truthful so honest young man be artist therefore believed in outline must sane intelligent creature doubt curve of cheek chin have put together said letter for here be will please take back must not keep longer took bowed made appointment a desired to tell truth because have deceived too long to beg to forgive to say that of course there be end to correspondence thank will be a desire exactly repeated a desire ought to have gone at once there be nothing more to say yet lingered holding letter in hand to write letter said have be for long time one of greatest pleasure partly because felt be writing to friend so wrote in full trust confidence partly because procured reply in shape of letter must take back letter of mine made answer be hard be not to lose friend so slowly acquired thus suddenly unexpectedly yes said be hard be very sorry be fault perhaps have said something in ignorance something ought not to have be said written something careless something have lowered in esteem oh said iris quickly have never said anything that gentleman must not have said if yourself found pleasure in answering letter yes said iris with frankness gave great pleasure to read to answer letter a well a must have not brought back letter hope will allow to keep if will why must not continue correspondence a before did not ask question confidently said iris decidedly can never be continued a before how must when once have met have learned truth then continued if can not write to other more can not talk ought to have informed on spot that thing be quite impossible not to be thought of for one moment must have said coldly firmly right minded well behaved girl must have said sir be not right that must come alone to young lady study such thing be not to be permitted meet in society may perhaps renew acquaintance girl do go on sometimes a if there be such thing a propriety at such case be said to be growing more frequent besides iris be not girl who be conversant with social convenances looked at pupil thoughtfully frankly can asked who hesitates be lost maxim can not be too often read said studied be one of very few golden rule omitted from solomon proverb can must be pleasant will permit blushed stammered wondering at ready acquiescence if will permit to call upon sometimes here if will allow anywhere else know name be by profession artist have studio close at hand in tite street to call upon here repeated now when one be tutor have be reading with pupil for two year one regard pupil with feeling may not be exactly parental be unconventional if arnold have said behold may being young man call upon young woman must have replied young man can never be when said may pupil call sometimes upon tutor distinction be at once established by impossible became possible yes said think may call grandfather have tea with evening at six may call then if will give pleasure really will let come here young man looked a if permission be likely to give greatest pleasure yes if wish spoke just exactly like oxford don giving undergraduate permission to take occasional walk with to call for conversation advice at certain time in room arnold noticed manner smiled still said a pupil meant to set at ease concerning propriety of visit thought meant continuation of certain little arrangement a to fee blushed said must not consider a pupil longer have put end to mind if only continue friend oh said must not pledge rashly to friendship perhaps will not like when once come to know then remain disciple oh flushed again must already think presumptuous enough in venturing to give advice have written so many foolish thing indeed interrupted thousand time let tell once for if may that have taught great deal far more than can ever understand than can explain where did get wisdom not from book of human life of that can not know much a yet wisdom be in imagination think will not be pupil disciple well because have told so much seem to have known so long besides because must never feel ashamed of having told so much will come if please a brother be not till afterward reflected on vast responsibility incurred in making

must have be comfortable presently strange feeling came over a if invisible force be pushing dragging forcing to leave chair throw at philosopher foot confess everything be mesmeric effect of reproachful eye fixed steadily upon in doorway like figure in nightmare figure incongruous out of place man in possession sitting passive unconcerned with one eye on street other on shop upstairs mr emblem be sitting fast asleep joy have made sleepy iris be at work among pupil letter compiling sum for fruiterer making paper on conic section for cambridge man working out trigonometrical equation for young schoolmaster mind full of solemn exultation glory for be woman who be loved other thing troubled little grandfather must get back equilibrium of mind shop might be shut up that mattered little arnold lala roy grandfather must live together arnold must work selfishness of youth be really astonishing nothing except perhaps toothache can make girl unhappy who be loved newly betrothed may say what plea face may be yard long when speaks of misfortune of others time heart be dancing to lala roy situation presented problem with insufficient data of must have to be guessed letter now lost said that certain case contained paper necessary to obtain unknown inheritance for iris how then to ascertain whether anybody be expecting looking for girl to claim inheritance then there be half coat of arm lastly there be certain customer of unknown name who have be acquainted with iris father before marriage so far for iris a for thief lala roy have doubt at be be quite certain grandson whose career have watched for year with interest curiosity who else be there who must steal paper who must help give access to safe did not only suspect be certain that james be in way cognizant of

never wont to call upon grandfather unless be in scrape wanted money one ever made poor young man welcome begged to come more often morning walked upstairs appeared so cheerful so entirely free from self reproach for past sin so easy in mind without least touch of old hang dog look that iris began to reproach for thinking badly of cousin when be told about robbery expressed greatest surprise that one in world must be so wicked a to rob old man like grandfather besides abhorrence of crime in abstract affirmed that robbery of safe be specie of villainy for hanging be too mild much too mild punishment then asked grandfather what be content of packet stolen when received answer except pleasant cheery laugh asked iris learned to sorrow that content be unknown must not therefore be identified even if be found said be thousand pity because if have be known reward might have be offered for own part must advise greatest caution nothing at must be done at first step must be taken might awaken suspicion must go on a if paper be without value a for that have real proof that there be robbery iris thought of telling about water mark of blank page refrained perhaps there be robbery after who be to prove what have be inside packet if there have be paper be valueless except to rightful owner must perhaps be sent back voluntarily after time say year two might be advertised for not a if owner be very anxious to get not revealing nature of paper cautiously presently if have not be destroyed holder of paper must answer advertisement then moderate reward might after while be offered so on giving excellent advice while be speaking lala roy entered room in noiseless manner took accustomed chair what do think sir said joseph when have finished have heard advice be not englishman suppose have got intelligence lala bowed spread hand replied not opinion must be asked joseph went on because see a only other person besides grandfather cousin in house might be suspected indeed added have doubt will be suspected when talk over conduct of case will be task suppose will perhaps be duty to suspect lala bowed again again spread hand did not speak in fact joseph now perceived that be having conversation wholly to grandfather sat passive listening a one who in dream hears voice doe not heed what be saying yet smiling politely iris listened paid heed thought that great deal of fuss be being made about paper perhaps be worth nothing a for inheritance why a never expected to get be not going to mourn loss of what perhaps be worth nothing very well then said joseph be have got to say have given best advice can suppose may go have lost voice iris think have better go joseph grandfather be not able to talk morning dare say advice be very good have other adviser a for mr lala roy call said joe roughly have warned suspicion certainly will fall upon what say be take care for own part never did believe in nigger must have one in house lala roy bowed again spread finger then joseph went away door between shop hall be half open looked in strange man be sitting in outer shop pipe in mouth james be leaning head upon hand with wild haggard eye gazing straight before poor devil murmured joseph feel for do indeed have key made for certainly let use once only once who be to prove be have opportunity day of using be very awkward foxy boy if be foxy must be in funk strolled away thinking that promised well lotty most favorably unsuspiciously received in new character one knowing content of packet grandfather gone silly for have have opportunity of advising exactly what wished to be done namely that silence inaction must be observed for space in order to give holder of property chance of offering term what better advice must give what line of action must be better safer for if james have known who be in house passage other side of door there must think have be collision of two solid body did not know presently lala roy came back torture began again james took down book put up again moved about feverishly doing nothing with duster in hand time felt deep accusing eye upon with silence worse than thousand question knew be perfectly certain that must be found out trouble for nothing bailiff man in possession safe robbed eye upon saying a plain a eye must speak thou art man joe be man said james not at what did be wrong be tempted oh what precious liar villain be what fool have be day passed more slowly than seemed possible for day to pas always man in shop always deep eye of silent hindoo upon be relief when once mr chalker looked in surveyed shelf with suspicious air asked if old man have by time listened to reason be business of who make plunder out of other men distress a jackal feed upon offal putrid carcass to know a exactly a can how fellow creature be situated for reason one doth diligently inquire listen pick up secret put two two together pry curiously into everybody affair being never so happy a when get opportunity of going to rescue of sinking man thus among who lived in good repute about lower end of king road none have better name than mr emblem one be considered to have made more of chance be with joy mr chalker received joe one evening heard from dismal story that if must not find fifty pound within few hour be ruined fifty pound be raised on bill bearing mr emblem name when be presented however circumstance explained old gentleman who have at first refused to own signature accepted meekly told one that grandson have written without polite formality of asking permission to sign for in other word joseph be forger mr chalker knew made more astonished when mr emblem did not take up bill got renewed quarter after quarter substituting at length bill of sale a if be determined to pay a much a possible for grandson sin where be asked money lender angrily why doe come down face creditor master upstairs said james have seen mr chalker that be off chump oh sir who must have thought that emblem must have come to ruin there be something james come think there must be something mr joseph said there be thousand be terrible liar oh mr chalker be terrible liar villain why be even deceived what have borrowed money worse worse do know where must find sir well know mr chalker be not in habit of giving address in case perhaps joe might be squeezed a well a grandfather unfortunately that bill with signature have be destroyed know perhaps if find out may tell james if can learn anything rubbish wo fetch money will make worth while james will indeed will make take share said james to if have to go to prison will go too sha' send without sending looked round watchful eye be gone hindoo have gone away noiselessly james breathed again after said how be to find out how be to prove anything mr joseph took thing helped to key be likely to split oh lord if be to find for at moment felt duplicate key in waistcoat pocket if be to find took key out looked at bright innocent looking thing a murderer might look at blood stained dagger just then a gazed upon holding just twelve inch in front of nose one hand be laid upon shoulder took key from between finger turned quickly knee gave way sunk upon floor cry oh mr lala roy sir mr lala roy be not thief be innocent will tell about will confess to will indeed will make atonement oh what miserable fool have be upon heel of folly said sage treadeth shame will now be able to understand word of wisdom say of wicked man curse of iniquity pursueth liveth in continual fear anxiety of mind taketh vengeance upon stand up speak man in possession looked on a if incident of kind be too common in family for to take notice of nothing in fact be able to awaken astonishment in heart of man in possession because nothing be sacred to

best way to get talk with cousin be to dine with arnold therefore went to chester square next day with photograph in pocket be hour before dinner when arrived clara be alone dear cried with enthusiasm be charmed be delighted with iris be glad said arnold mendaciously be delighted with in way be more better than must have expected far more few americanism of course doubt said arnold when saw thought

written on girl noble brow arnold plain so that may read be truly wonderful went on how old gentle blood show will break out under most unexpected condition in face be not much like father be true though sometimes catch momentary resemblance instantly disappears again eye be not in least like have manner carriage of little trick peculiarity though perhaps will observe trace of of in time especially resembles in voice tone timbre reminds moment of poor claude suppose said arnold that one must inherit something if be only voice from one father have said anything to yet about money

especially actress though have only be to theater once twice in life at liverpool heard one sing what call tropical song actually remembers carried away in head word can sing just a sing on stage with vulgarity gesture imitated to very life of course must not like to do before anybody else be really wonderful indeed said arnold must be very clever amusing of course said clara with colossal ignorance american lady can hardly be expected to understand english vulgarity doubt there be american variety arnold thought that vulgar song must be judged at true value by lady american english said nothing then young lady appeared have be driving about with clara among various shop now bore upon person charming result of journey in shape of garment be rich in texture splendid in making really be handsome girl only with certain air of being dressed for stage arnold now more than suspicious be not dazzled by gorgeous raiment only considered how cousin must for moment imagine person to

by gentle blood breaking out nearly have breaking out at dinner certainly be not due to gentle blood after dinner arnold found sitting on sofa with clara who be telling something about glory of deseret family be half inclined to pity girl to laugh be not certain for patience with listened in order to make amends for bad impression might have produced at dinner asked presently if must play might be certainly be vulgar must play well knew good music people generally think that good music softens manner doe not permit who play practice to be vulgar concerning young person so much must not be said with truth play very well where did learn who be master arnold asked began to reply stopped short have very nearly caught ask question said told not to ask question before where must learn in
