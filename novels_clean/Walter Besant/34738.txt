arundel ' said chief while checkley be gone walked to window observed that one sitting at table must by merely reaching out take anything from safe put back again unobserved if happened to be occupied looking way grave face became dark returned to own chair sat thinking while face grew darker eye harder until mr arundel appeared athelstan arundel be at time recently admitted member of respectable too numerous family of solicitor be between two three twenty year of age tall handsome young fellow of good manly type be ex articled clerk of house have just be appointed managing clerk until something must be found for arundels be city family of importance perhaps something in city firm might presently be achieved by united influence of family money meantime here be at work earning salary gaining experience checkley for part who be a jealous of master a only old servant young mistress have right to be have imagined symptom indication of growing preference favour toward young gentleman on part of mr dering certainly have mr arundel in own office good deal gave work of most confidential character besides mr dering be executor trustee for young arundel mother have be old friend schoolfellow of father have known young man two sister from infancy ber arundel ' lawyer began at own house addressed ward by christian name in office a managing clerk prefixed courtesy title 'an extremely disagreeable thing have happened here nothing short of forgery interrupt if please ' for young man looked a if be about to practise interjection 'it be most surprising thing admit need say so however that waste time forgery on fifth of month three week ago cheque apparently in handwriting with signature so skilfully executed a to deceive even checkley manager of bank be presented at bank duly cashed amount be large l sum be paid across counter in ten pound note be now stopped if there be left kept eye fixed on young man whose face betrayed other emotion than of natural surprise will doubtless trace note through of course forger have already ascertained who presented cheque follow ' 'certainly there have be forgery forged cheque have be cashed note be stopped have clue to forgery suspicion yet none be only beginning to collect fact lawyer spoke in coldest most austere manner be laying one by one before ' young arundel bowed 'observe then that forged cheque belongs to cheque book have be lying forgotten by in safe for two year here be book turn to last counterfoil here be cheque forged cheque corresponds see ' 'perfectly book have be in safe for two year have be taken out by someone presumably forger cheque have be forged counterfoil filled up book replaced why be trouble taken if man have got cheque why did fill up counterfoil why did return book beg pardon ' 'your question be pertinent come to next point safe be never opened by be open so long a be in room at other time 'certainly know that ' havery well man who took out cheque book forged cheque replaced book must have done in very presence ' 'oh must not someone somehow have got key thought of that be possible drawer be full of valuable jewellery curio kind of thing must easily be turned into money be not touched now have safe be opened by key thing must certainly have vanished ' beo must seem 'these be main fact mr arundel oh one more have found messenger who cashed cheque perhaps there be one two other point of more le importance there be only one more point wish to bring before of course make charge insinuate none must be remembered there be only two person who have have access to safe in such manner a to make possible for to take anything out of checkley ' 'no cried old man at time of robbery be working at table with safe open within reach of left hand be fact mind one of fact of case not charge ' 'what ' cried young man cheek aflame mean ' mean nothing nothing at want checkley who alone have used room not counting caller who sat in chair to know fact 'the fact yes of course fact well spoke rapidly little incoherently 'it be true that worked here oh be absurd know nothing of cheque book lying in safe be working at table ' went to table beitting in chair how must get up search about in safe for unknown unsuspected cheque book before very eye ' ' know seems impossible only desire to consider with fact have mr dering spoken just little le coldly with just little le dryness in manner what followed must perhaps have be different 'yes fact repeated young man let get at fact chief fact be that whoever took cheque filled up must have known existence of cheque book more than two year old must seem so 'who must know about old cheque book only one who have be about office more than two year one who have have opportunity of examining safe now sat there sat here ' seated only turning chair round 'how be possible for man sitting here to take anything out of safe without seeing how be possible for without knowledge to examine slowly carefully content of safe 'everything be possible ' said mr dering still coldly 'let not argue on possibility have certain fact before by help of will hope to find out others 'at five o'clock day put work in drawer of table go away opened drawer a if to illustrate unimportant fact saw in two three piece of paper with writing on took out 'good heaven cried be imitation of handwriting ' checkley crossed room swiftly snatched from laid before master 'imitations of handwriting ' said 'imitations exercise in forgery practice make perfect found in drawer now mr dering looked at paper laid beside forged cheque additional fact said 'these be certainly imitation probable conclusion be that be made by same hand forged cheque ' 'found in drawer said checkley 'used by mr arundel never by ah only two be imitation will prove be not in ' 'the fact that imitation be found in drawer said mr dering fact may may not be important 'what ' cried young man flaring up 'you think that made imitation permit yet to make conclusion at everything however be possible ' then foolish young man lost temper head have known life ' cried 'you have known people yet at first moment be ready to believe have committed most abominable forgery father oldest friend mother trustee own guardian ' 'pardon there be certain fact in case have laid before have shown ' suspect ' arundel repeated 'and time man that man clerk who know everything ever done in office be in about place day long 'the imitation said checkley quietly 'be found in own drawer by ' 'who put there who made villain scoundrel ' betop stop ' said mr dering coldly 'we go too fast let first prove fact will then proceed to conclusion sir clearly believe that forged name robbed of money have not got ten pound in world be not suppose fact bear on case think have seven hundred pound somewhere very good think so if please meanwhile be not going to stay in service of man who be capable of thinking such thing leave service at once get one else to serve somebody who like being charged with forgery theft ' flung out of room banged door behind have run away ' said checkley 'actually run away at very outset what do think now ' think will daresay find out truth in due course meantime document will remain in keeping ' 'only hope sir ' clerk began 'that after what have just seen heard after such insolence running away ' be as checkley so far a appearance go one must get at safe except arundel so far a ascertained fact go there be nothing to connect of with thing be foolish young man if be innocent must suppose believe look did not convey idea of robust faith will come back when have cooled down ' 'the imitation of handwriting in drawer ' man who forged cheque said mr dering 'whoever be must easily have written imitation will see that hot headed boy mother bring to reason now checkley will resume work not word of business if please outside have to think of a well remember a well a boy have access to safe enough enough ' athelstan arundel walked home way foaming raging omnibus cab conveyance ever built must contain young man in such rage mother lived at pembridge square be four good measured mile from lincoln inn walked whole way walking through crowd under nose of dray horse carriage horse cart horse without taking least notice of when reached home dashed into drawing room where found two sister hilda elsie one of girl of eighteen other of thirteen with flaming cheek fiery eye delivered of story hurled at head called upon to share indignation to join with in scorn contempt of man supposed best friend trustee guardian adviser father best friend who have done thing who have accused on bare evidence of two three circumstantial fact of such crime there be something magnetic in great emotion one proof of reality be that be magnetic be only actor who can endow assumed emotion with magnetism elsie younger girl fell into corresponding sympathy of wrath be equal to occasion passion for passion joined fed flame for person be not magnetic elder sister remained cold from time to time wanted to know exactly what mr dering have said brother be too angry to remember be pained puzzled neither soothed sympathised with then mother returned whole story be told again elsie assisting now mr arundel be woman of great sense practical woman woman of keen judgment prided upon possession of quality be not supposed to be especially feminine heard story with disturbed face knitted brow beurely said 'what tell athelstan be beyond belief mr dering of men to accuse of thing be impossible ' wish be impossible accuses of forging cheque for l say that while be working in office for fortnight ago took certain cheque book out of safe forged writing on cheque returned cheque book be what say do call that accusing ' 'certainly if say that how can mr dering most exact careful of men will drive to lincoln inn at once find out dear boy pray calm there be there must be terrible mistake went immediately have long interview with solicitor mr dering be evidently much disturbed by what have happened did not receive a usually received client sitting in arm chair pushed back chair stood up leaning hand on back of tall thin erect figure gray haired austere of face there be little to reassure mother in face very trouble of made heart sink ' certainly have not accused athelstan ' said 'it be however quite true that there have be robbery here that of large sum of money le than l ' what have to do with boy ' 'we have made few preliminary inquiry will do for mr arundel what did for son will yourself understand what connection inquiry have with ' proceeded coldly without comment to set forth case so far a have got at fact a went on mother heart became a heavy a lead before finished be certain there be see way of presenting case without comment be more efficacious than amount of talk mr arundel plainly perceived be indeed case that lawyer have by time little doubt in own mind that son have done thing ' thought right ' continued 'to lay before fact at outset if be innocent thought will be better able to prove innocence perhaps to find guilty person if be guilty may be led to confession restitution fact about cheque book safe be very clear be certain that safe have not be opened by other key only person who have have access to be checkley son athelstan a for checkley must do must not possibly do thing be quite beyond ' mr arundel groaned 'this be terrible ' said beeantime note be numbered may be traced be stopped will certainly find criminal by mean of note ber dering ' mr arundel rose laid hand on 'you be very old friend tell if wretched boy go away if give back money remains if find rest will there be further investigation 'to compound felony be crime be however one of crime men sometimes commit without repentance shame dear lady if will confess restore will see mr arundel drove home again came away fully persuaded in own mind that son only son none other must be that guilty person knew mr dering room well have sat there hundred of time knew safe knew old checkley perceived enormous improbability of ancient clerk doing such thing knew again what temptation assail young man in london saw what trustee thought of jumped to conclusion that son none other be guilty person even saw how must have done saw quick look while mr dering back be turned snatching of cheque book quick replacing very keenness of judgment helped to conviction woman le clever must have be slower to believe shameful miserable termination of hope for boy career that must think of afterwards for moment only thing be to get boy away to induce to confess to get away be calmer when got home be still talking about thing must wait till right man be discovered then must have old dering on knee thing must be set right in few day have fear of delay be quite certain that be checkley that old villain oh must do by of course nobody must believe that of have accomplice confederate behind checkley part of job be to steal cheque book give to confederate share swag mother ' asked mother sat down looked pale wretched ' cried elder sister what have happened what doe mr dering say ' 'he accuses nobody ' replied in hard dry voice 'but what ' asked hilda told everything everything oh ' burst into sob cry though despised woman who cry 'it be terrible be terrible be incredible yet what can think what can one think leave hilda leave elsie ' two girl went out unwillingly son how can believe yet on one hand boy of two twenty exposed to temptation of town on other old clerk of fifty year service integrity when fact be laid before calmly coldly fly into rage run away while checkley calmly remains to await inquiry mr arundel have be accustomed life to consider mr dering a wisest of men felt instinctively that regarded son with suspicion heard fact jumped to conclusion that be prodigal profligate that have fallen into evil way spent money in riotous living concluded that have committed crime in order to get more money for more skittle orange 'athelstan ' laid hand upon arm did not dare to lift eye behold that guilty face 'athelstan confess make reparation so far a can confess oh son son will be caught tried found guilty oh can not say through note have changed be known stopped ' boy wrath be now changed to madness 'you cried own mother believe oh be going mad together what then be turned out of house a be turned out of place go then go here swore mighty oath a strong a anybody out of spain can make ' will never never never come home again till come to beg forgiveness own

elsie threw arm about betay show that be wrong oh be innocent will never never never believe ' kissed again tore away street door slammed behind heard footstep a strode away have gone then elsie fell into loud weeping wailing hilda went to comfort mother beother ' said 'did really really truly do ' 'what else can believe did that old clerk where be ' 'he be gone say will come back when innocence be proved mother if be innocent why doe run away be foolish to say that be because believe have said nothing except that must believe without reason innocent young men run away when be charged with robbery stay fight out athelstan must have stayed ' later on when be little recovered hilda tried to consider subject more calmly have not mother cleverness be not without part following remark made by girl of eighteen prove so much beother said 'perhaps be better so long a suspicion rest upon that must be away will certainly know where be will want money will write for if must prove that somebody else did thing can easily bring back a martyr for own part must be so glad must willingly beg pardon on knee of course must easily get replaced in office if be proved that did do that think will be certain to find out mr dering for sake will be ready to hush up perhaps may get note back ca have used in case will be great comfort to feel that be out of way brother convicted tried in open court sentenced oh ' shuddered must never get over never never must be most dreadful thing for elsie a for going away if people ask why be gone where must invent something can easily make up story hint that have be wild there be disgrace happily about young man being wild be only thing reconciles one to horrid selfishness of wild young men if by going away in pretended rage athelstan have really enabled to escape horrid scandal why mother in case may confess that blow have be by providence most mercifully softened for most mercifully ought to consider that mother ' 'yes dear yes be gone athelstan be gone future seems ruined there be hope for can see hope dear be so promising thought family influence must be have got single city solicitor in whole family thought that be so clever so ambitious so eager to get on make money be credit to family solicitor do sometimes especially city solicitor become so very very rich now be gone done nothing left to hope miserable wish that there must be scandal 'it be indeed dreadful still consider scandal mother think must find out if can something about private life how have be living have be out good deal of evening lately if there be person on whom have be tempted to spend money if have be gambling betting of thing read of ' young lady thanks to beneficent assistance of certain work of fiction be tolerably acquainted with way of young men temptation must be satisfaction to know at least ' lady of family where there be 'wild young man generally find easy to get at fact of wildness remain locked up in bosom of companion detail must be learned about wildness contrary seemed so far a must be learned to have led very quiet regular life then ' said philosopher of eighteen quoting from novel been shelter other be bad together scandal everybody know that kind of brother sister by whom family event be considered with view to scandal likely to be caused personal injury resulting to envy will follow personal advantage accruing from event that brother be perhaps shameful criminal might be considered by hilda arundel later on at first be only capable of perceiving that horrid fact unless must be hidden away kept secret might very materially injure almost naturally folded hand sweetly laid comely head little on one side be attitude of resignation may be observed in certain picture of saint holy woman hilda knew many little attitude also quite naturally glanced at mirror on wall observed that pose be one of sorrow borne with christian resignation must blame hilda mother case a put by mr dering in form of plain fact without comment did seem very black indeed against athelstan in family first feeling in such case be instinct of self preservation be to hush up thing if possible to avoid scandal scandal a prosecution of brother for forgery with verdict of guilty be most truly horrible deplorable fatal thing take respectability out of family perhaps at critical moment when family be just assuming robe of respectability ruin chance of girl blight prospect of boy drive away friend be black spot soap ever advertised must never wash off therefore while mother hoped first of that boy must escape clutch of law hilda be first of grateful that there must be scandal mr dering must not talk about thing must not interfere with own prospect be sad be miserable yet scandal with what deep deep sigh of satisfaction did young lady repeat that there must probably be no scandal a for elsie child went about for many day with tearful eye red cheek swollen nose be rebellious sharp with mother to sister refused to speak day went on became week month year otherwise must not have be day nothing at be heard of athelstan sent letter to one did not even write for money knew not where be what be doing disappeared be understood that there have be wildness now be very remarkable though forger have have clear run of three week must not be discovered that of note have be presented perhaps be sent abroad yet foreign colonial bank must know number of stopped note towards discovery of forger further step have be taken commissionaire who took cheque have be a have seen easily found said must know old gentleman who gave forged draft to cash said being again interrogated that checkley be not in least like old gentleman what must be thought then athelstan must have beade up a old man be fond of private theatrical must make up very well of course have made up then point being settled left off talking about business other thing happened important thing made memory of prodigal son to wax dim

cheerful decided taking practical measure at once cheered up lawyer steadied shattered nerve checkley clerk looked on gloomily replaced paper in safe stood beside a if to guard followed movement of new partner with watchful suspicious eye muttered sullenly between teeth first george sent telegram to city for broker then while old clerk still stood beside safe mr dering continued to show sign of agitation uncontrollable sometimes walking about room sometimes sitting at table sometimes looking into empty shelf of safe began to look through copied letter be have gone out of mr dering office searched for six month working backwards 'nothing for six month said 'checkley give letter went through be letter received at office filed endorsed dated there be not one during letter of six month

partner will go on ' 'we must have done so sent client bill for amount with commission if have be instructed to sell must have paid in to mr dering bank amount realised le commission transfer be kind of work mr dering transferred stock to edmund gray client be therefore for to settle with client charge for transfer value of stock therefore sent bill for charge be sent by hand cheque be received by

signature checkley two clot be wanting after word dering flourish after last n be curtailed of usual dimension did ever know to alter signature by single curve ' checkley replied 'two clot wanting flourish go on sir have just thought of something go on ' 'you mean to say that letter be forgery asked mr elli then oh be impossible must then be beginning of whole series of forgery be quite impossible to credit letter came from office post mark show be posted in district answer be sent here transfer consider transfer be posted to office came back duly signed witnessed from office forwarded certificate made out in name of edmund gray to office got acknowledgment from office sent account of transaction with commission charge to office got cheque for latter from office how can such complicated business a only first of transaction be forgery why want dozen confederate at least for such job a quite understand yet ' said george inexperienced in transfer of stock share 'well can not sell stock without owner authority must sign transfer if receive commission from lawyer to transfer stock to client be not business to ask whether receives money not ' 'yes yes be there nothing to show for sale of l worth of paper george asked mr dering 'nothing at letter everything be forgery 'and mr elli received cheque for commission ' 'certainly 'get old cheque cheque book ' said mr dering cheque be drawn a letter be written in mr dering handwriting with slight difference have pointed out in signature be quite sure asked george 'that did not sign that cheque ' be perfectly certain that did not ' a for edmund gray of south square gray inn what do know about ' 'nothing at absolutely nothing ' know something ' said checkley 'but go on go on ' 'he may be non existent person for what know ' 'certainly know nothing about edmund gray ' bit murmured checkley mr elli went on 'this be only beginning in march wrote to again be to say received letter purporting to be from in letter here be instructed to transfer certain stock paper of enclosed amounting to about l to edmund gray aforesaid in same way a before transfer paper be sent to for signature in same way a before be signed returned in same way a before commission be charged to paid by be exactly same transaction a before only for double sum involved in february business mr dering took second letter looked at with kind of patient resignation know nothing about ' said 'nothing at 'there be third last transaction said broker time in april here be letter written by with instruction exactly same a in previous case dealing with stock to amount of l duly carried out for received cheque for commission ' one of letter signature of mine to transfer paper to cheque be forgery ' said mr dering slowly have client named edmund gray know one of name never received money from transfer investment be stolen ' look at letter again ' said george examined carefully comparing with other 'they be so wonderfully forged that must deceive most careful must not hesitate to swear to handwriting have already be explained that mr dering handwriting be of kind be not uncommon with who write good deal unimportant word be conveyed by curve with without tail while really important word be clearly written signature however be large distinct florid signature of house have be flourishing for hundred year more signature have never varied 'look at ' said george again 'who must not swear to writing ' must for one ' said mr elli have known for forty year more if be not own writing dering be very finest imitation ever made ' ' think memory can be quite gone checkley have ever have client named edmund gray ' 'no never have forgotten one thing forgery eight year ago cheque of l be payable to order of edmund gray ' 'ah so be seems important ' beost important said george 'the forger must not possibly by accident choose same name can not be coincidence have forged cheque ' have always kept ' mr dering replied 'on chance of using to prove crime convict criminal will find checkley in right hand drawer of safe thank here be pay to order of edmund gray here be endorsement so have handwriting at rate george took betrange said ' must without hesitation swear to handwriting here a well look signature to cheque be exactly same a of letter two dot missing after name flourish after last n curtailed be so handwriting of cheque of letter be same signature be slightly systematically altered in exactly same way in letter cheque 'this again ' said george 'can hardly be coincidence seems to that man who wrote that cheque also wrote letter endorsement be in hand might also be taken for mr dering own nothing to be got out of endorsement about transfer paper said george 'they must have to be witnessed a well a signed 'they be witnessed ' said broker 'by clerk named lorry ' have such man in office checkley send for lorry ' lorry be clerk employed in mr dering outer office being interrogated said that have recollection of witnessing signature for transfer paper have witnessed many signature be not informed what paper be asked if remembered especially witnessing signature in february march april replied that must not remember that have witnessed great many signature sometimes mr dering wanted to witness own signature sometimes of client if be shown signature might remember lorry therefore be allowed to depart to own place 'there can be no longer doubt ' said george 'that attempt have be made at robbery on very large scale attempt only mr dering asked 'where be certificate ' say attempt because ca really steal stock dividend be only paid to who lawfully posse edmund gray can find if exists take however that doe not be probably name assumed by forger suppose that have made haste to sell stock whether will certainly recover property people may a well steal field a steal stock share 'we can easily find out for ' said mr elli have become of paper ' 'if thief have kept ' george went on 'all must make must be dividend for five month that however be only because bank book be not examined for so long must not reckon upon unusual stroke of luck seems almost certain that must get rid of stock a quickly a must suppose that have realised whole amount be immense sum of money must have to be paid by cheque into bank holder must only draw out money gradually might to be sure go to america have whole amount transferred must not help much unless must draw out in small sum payable to confederate in fact robbery seems to hedged about with difficulty almost impossible 'it be most extraordinary attempt at robbery that ever be ' said mr elli eight thousand pound in share well will find out for if have be sold to whom meantime old friend be down hearted about a mr austin say will certainly get property back again what live in civilised country can not have large sum like l stolen bodily property be kept longer in bag of gold bank note bank investment tend to make great robbery impossible courage will get back property ' mr dering shook head doubtfully 'there be chance george suggested 'one have heard of robbery effected with view of blackmail afterwards suppose be to get letter offering whole to be returned for certain sum 'no be now four month since thing be done have sold out stock disappeared gone to america a suggested why thing may have be sold dozen time over in interval be danger suppose have be sold dozen time over consider here be share in great western transfer from to b very good share now belongs to b stand in name whether honestly come by not b sends to broker who sell to c again to d transaction be right in form except first can trace share from owner to owner b have vanished say to c bought that share of thief c say very sorry how be to know d have got now d say that be will stick to go to law about share what be going to happen upon word know well be only conjecture let first find out what have become of share of course there be record to have only to refer will let know by to morrow morning if can ' when mr elli be gone george began to sum up for clearing of own mind ascertained fact of case so far a have got 'first said 'the letter to elli northcote be written on headed paper clearly therefore writer must have have access to office next knew must copy handwriting third be able to intercept delivery of letter to prevent getting wished to stop because correspondence be conducted openly through post seems to be very important point fourth letter be apparently in handwriting very skilfully imitated instead of being dictated then signed fifth must at least have known of last forgery how did arrive at name of edmund gray be out of devilry mockery because forgery escaped detection that used name again sixth must have have access to safe where cheque book a well a certificate be kept seventh must have known office pretty well how did find out name of broker eighth handwriting appeared to be exactly same a of former forgery 'it be same a last time said checkley 'that forgery be done in office if ever thing be done here same with same with well time will show same with glared from under great eyebrow at young partner a if suspected that young gentleman must throw light upon mystery if wished have given time long enough to discover author of last business said mr dering 'but have not chosen to do so a yet loss of property ' groaned 'the loss of close on forty thousand pound ' believe be lost ' said george 'it ca be lost be bit of railway part of reservoir corner of gas work ca lose thing unless indeed difficulty suggested by mr elli occurs here mr dering pushed back chair began again to walk about room in restless agitation be no longer grave serious lawyer became one of own client lamenting a have so often lamented in room greatness of misfortune uttered actual commonplace of men in distress there be dreadful sameness about lamentation of ill luck know hardness of thing injustice of impossibility of warding off own sagacity in taking precaution dreadfulness of being singled out of whole generation for exceptional misfortune mr dering grave calm reserved old lawyer who seemed made of granite broke down under blow became ordinary human creature in lower walk weep checkley must have wept mr dering became eloquent wrathful sarcastic retired general who have ruined by gambling in stock must so bemoan luck george listened saying nothing be experience man so strong have weak point man be completely armoured against arrow of fate presently grew little more calm sat down 'forgive george ' said gently 'forgive outbreak there be more in business than know of feel a if know something about ca bring out be growing so forgetful forget whole day be filled with feeling ought to know about a for loss what have said be true yet feel a do about property be too young have not got property yet wait few year then will be able to agree with that there be nothing in world so hard a to lose property property that have made by own exertion for ' 'now talk like ' said checkley 'that be sense nothing so dreadful a to lose property be enough to kill people have killed many people mean everything understand that more older get ' 'you do echoed checkley 'there be nothing in world worth considering except property ' 'it mean remember virtue prudence courage quick sight restraint tenacity fighting quality do well to honour rich men hoped to receive honour a rich man when have put together few thousand by exercise of finer quality so that thought of give dignity ' cried checkley straightening 'to feel that be gone gone gone be cruel george understand be young a yet have money checkley have saved ' bee oh trifle trifle covered mouth with hand to conceal smile of satisfaction 'you be reputed rich 'no not rich chance have be few have not let go rich must regard loss robbery of property checkley ' old clerk shook head have word adequate to question from loss mr dering went on 'there be sense of insecurity felt once before when other forgery took place there seems safety anywhere paper keep in private safe to one have key never leave open if leave room even to go into room be taken cheque book keep there be taken out cheque stolen finally thing be put in bundle of note for instance say that feel sense of helplessness a if everything might be taken from must be powerless to resist ' 'let first get back certificate said george 'and will find out defeat gang if be gang of confederate yes be a say ground seems sinking beneath one foot when one own investment be sold for nothing by letter so like own writing that must deceive anybody ' 'done in office checkley murmured 'in office same a last time well will find will find ' began to bundle paper back into safe murmuring beame a last time done in office will find will find found before will find now ' chapter xii first find 'yes said george thoughtfully ' day two ought to unravel matter must first however before going to police find out a much a can ourselves let take up case by for bit 'no checkley grumbled first catch man first aside everything ' said chief 'everything george forget everything until have found out mystery of conspiracy look to like long firm george went on ' long firm with sham name respectable address of course there be such person really a edmund gray 'it be not only loss perhaps let hope ' mr dering sighed 'only temporary loss if real loss then most terrible blow not only that be sense of insecurity one ever found out about cheque here be note in safe time put in ' said checkley 'this be second time same name still edmund gray fill with uneasiness be terrified george know not what may be next blow what may be taken from mortgage house land everything go can do work of office work by work can not do be not able to think about thought overpower cloud reason ' 'well said george ' will do what can suppose there be edmund gray at one must try to find out there can be harm in paying visit to gray inn if thing have be done yesterday must be necessary to strike at once with warrant for arrest of said edmund gray a be four month since last robbery there can be small harm in delay of day two will go inquire little nothing easier than to inquire there be man address everybody know gray inn everybody know south square place be only ten minute walk from lincoln inn george took hat walked over proceeded straight to expecting to find such name on door post on contrary there be 'nd floor mr edmund gray among other occupant of staircase mounted stair on second floor right be name over door edmund gray ' outer door be closed be sign that tenant of chamber be either not at home not visible on first floor be office of firm of solicitor sent in card name of dering son command respectful attention of solicitor in london one of partner received firm of dering son be anxious to see mr edmund gray who have chamber overhead at what hour be mr edmund gray generally in room nobody knew not either of partner not of clerk might have be met going up down stair nobody knew by sight anything about at first sight seemed suspicious afterwards george reflected that men may live for year on same staircase never know anything about other men who live in gray inn visit other there be little neighbourly spirit among men in chamber rather unspoken distrust 'but ' said partner can tell who be landlord doe not take room of inn direct a do from one who have several set on long lease sublet room may know something about man at steward office across square if not landlord will certainly know george asked if edmund gray be newly arrived appeared that have be in inn for long time then informant added 'he may have be here hundred year for know never think of neighbour in chamber opposite be man whose name have be over door a long a can remember anything know who be what be business even know by sight so with mr edmund gray if be to meet on stair must not be wiser see be only here in daytime now other man on second floor do know something about because be coach be fellow of college man in garret hear about occasionally because be old barrister who sometimes defends prisoner at steward office george put same question ' be solicitor said 'here be card be most anxious to see mr edmund gray of must save time by letting know at what hour be in chamber must tell nothing mr gray be not tenant of inn very likely be residential tenant who came home in evening after business everything learned be step gained whether edmund gray be man long firm name have be on door for many year many year must confederacy of swindler go on for many year especially if undertook such mighty scheme for plunder a business next went to address of landlord be house agent in bloomsbury apparently person of respectability 'if must tell george began with same question what hour must find tenant in chamber if must give business address must be very greatly obliged want to find at once to day if possible on very important business 'well be sorry very sorry in fact know anything about tenant hour can give place of business believe have business 'oh took a tenant must have have reference 'certainly upon can satisfy very shortly ' opened great book turned over page be to south square gray inn second floor north side edmund gray gentleman rent l year date of taking room february at half quarter reference messrs dering son solicitor new square lincoln inn ' mean that referred to to messrs dering son in year 'that be so must like to see letter received on application wait moment rang bell clerk appeared to whom gave instruction be bound to say ' landlord went on 'that more satisfactory tenant than mr gray doe not exist pay rent regularly by post office order quarter on day before quarter day wonder ' stopped because to begin wondering be always futile especially at so early stage when there be already accumulated fact to go upon not till then wondering becomes putting together of puzzle here be letter gentleman house agent read letter received on application to reference reply to letter of th beg to inform that mr edmund gray be client of ours gentleman of independent mean that be quite able to pay reasonable rent for residence chamber obedient servant dering son suppose ' added man doe want better reference than own certainly not george looked at letter presented a to handwriting exactly same point of likeness of difference a other letter in strange case body of letter apparently written in hand of mr dering be so a to deceive everybody signature with one two small omission 'certainly not ' repeated reference of course did not hesitate did ever see mr gray 'certainly have seen often first when be getting room furnished afterwards on various occasion kind of man be to look at ' 'elderly not exactly kind of man 'd expect to have chamber mostly be young one who like freedom elderly gentleman pleasant in manner smiling affable gray haired 'oh then there be real edmund gray of ten year standing in inn who lived have chamber at number stated in forged letter suppose ' said house agent respectable tenant have not done anything bad 'n not to knowledge name occurs in rather disagreeable case must be so very kind a to let know in case must meet of course will write to that be most anxious to see ' landlord readily promised 'there be person said 'who can tell great deal more than anybody else be laundress know who look after can find out at inn policeman will know go ask ' in game of battledore shuttlecock latter have chance except to take thing coolly without temper george be shuttlecock be hit back into gray inn time into arm of policeman sir ' said guardian of peace know anything about gentleman if be one of noisy one must know be therefore have never heard of if life at can tell who doe room be old mr cripps life in lane ' street be now comparatively speaking purged cleansed be not yet quite ideal spot for one who must have pure air cleanliness combined with godliness of conversation however individual liberty be nowhere more absolutely free uncontrolled than in lane mr cripps lived on top floor nearest to heaven of ought to be thinking because be now old near end be so old that be quite past work only kept on mr gray room because never slept there gave trouble except to go to in morning with duster to drop asleep for hour so what one gentleman gave moreover be have to live upon though morning be warm be sitting over fire watching small pan in be stewing savoury mess consisting of 'block ornament ' with onion carrot turnip perhaps be thinking poor old soul of day gone by gone by for fifty year when be young wore feather in hat old lady of class think much about vanished beauty think good deal about vanished feather vanished hat remember old free carriage in street with young friend careless laugh ready jest be ancient gentlewoman who remembers vanished beauty think of what be fifty year ago mr cripps heard step on narrow stair leading to room manly step mounted higher more slowly because stair be dark a well a narrow then visitor hat knocked against door opened stood there looking in gentleman not district visitor sister trying to persuade to early church yet clergyman young gentleman 'you be mr cripps asked 'the policeman at gray inn directed here be laundress believe to mr edmund gray of be sir ' replied suspiciously laundress be like hall porter of club must not ask about of gentleman have called to see mr edmund gray on very important business found door shut will kindly tell at what hour be generally in chamber shook head held out hand young gentleman placed sovereign in palm finger closed over coin clutched hid away in secret fold of ragged dress there be woman so ragged so dropping to piece with shred streamer tatter can find safe hiding place somewhere in rag for coin for anything else be small precious ' never tell tale about gentleman said 'especially when be young handsome like pore laundress have eye ear hand have got tongue if have there might be terrible terrible trouble oh dear yes mr gray be young gentleman be old be same thing ' 'then said george 'how when can find ' ' be coming to that ca find sometimes come sometimes doe come ' 'oh doe live in room then 'no doe live in room us room sometimes 'what doe use for ' 'how must know gentleman do thing with pen paper how must know what do make money with pen paper dun know how do suppose mr gray be making money like rest of ' oh go to chamber writes ' beometimes be week week month month before come at always money regular beforehand sent in envelope postal order ' what be private address suppose life in country know where life know nothing about go there morning do room be know there be more information to be obtained sometimes came to inn sometimes stayed away for week week for month month might have told more young gentleman ' murmured old woman might have told le p'raps will come again went back to lincoln inn set down fact first there be forgery in year in name of edmund gray be used next in series of forgery just discovered not only be name of edmund gray used throughout handwriting of letter cheque be exactly same a of first cheque with same peculiarity in signature must hardly be coincidence same man must have written whole then who be edmund gray be real personage living man not firm one known to landlord of chamber to laundress if to nobody else did not live in chamber used for business purpose sometimes called there wrote what did write where be what be doing when be not at chamber might be one leader follower of secret gang one have read of such gang especially in french novel where leader be noble duke of first rank princess young lovely of highest fashion why must there not be such gang in london clever conspirator must go very long way before be even suspected in civilisation of cheque registered share official transfer property be so much defended that be difficult to break through armour there must be weak place in armour must be possible for wit of man to devise plan by mean of property can be attacked successfully have struck conspiracy thus man calling edmund gray get lease of chamber by mean of forged letter in answer to reference be convenient for certain conspirator hereinafter called company to have address though may never be used conspiracy begin by forging cheque to order for l be at outset when conspirator be young be found dangerous note be therefore replaced in safe note that company through one other of member have access to safe might perhaps be by mean of key in evening after office hour by one who be about place day very good continued connection of member of firm with dering son be proved by subsequent proceeding after eight year company having matured machinery perhaps worked out with success other enterprise return to first quarry where have advantage of access to letter can look over disposition be thus enabled to conduct successive coup bigger than one before for four month thing remains undiscovered having certificate in hand what be to prevent from selling whole dividing proceeds nothing yet in such case must disappear here be edmund gray still fearlessly at large why have not got clear away long before again correspondence concerning edmund gray be carried on between office broker there be letter from edmund gray at suppose must be found impossible to connect edmund gray with transaction carried on in name suppose real edmund gray be to deny knowledge at of transaction suppose be to say that ten year before have brought letter of introduction to mr dering knew nothing more about well certificate what about possession must have to be accounted for so turned matter over over arrived at nothing not even next step to take went back to chief reported what have discovered existence of edmund gray letter of recommendation to landlord forgery ' groaned mr dering 'it be done in office said george 'it be done in office letter cheque everything ' 'the office checkley repeated doubt about ' 'give up everything else george ' said mr dering eagerly 'everything else find out find out employ detective spend money a much a please be on volcano know not what may be taken from next only find out partner dear partner find out ' when george be gone checkley went after opened door mysteriously to assure that one be listening 'what be going on like for checkley ' asked master irritably 'be forgery rain forgery 'no look here trouble too much about try to think how be done talk about other man look here have sent that young gentleman to find out business well mark word wo wo say will make splash wo find anything who found out last job 'you said did nothing be proved ' found that out plenty of proof there be look here ' small eye twinkled under shaggy eyebrow `` ll find out job a well see if why rubbed hand ho have found out ask put single question have got oh have got have got for a say on toast ' chapter xiii thing more remarkable after prodigious event a discovery of unparalleled forgery anything might happen without being regarded people mind be open at such time to see hear accept everything after earthquake ghost walk solid thing fly away of own accord good men commit murder rich men go empty away nobody be in least surprised see what happened very next day at office in new square when george arrived in morning found that senior partner have not yet appeared be late for first time for fifty year more be late went to place empty chair gave air of bereavement to room checkley be laying out table be have done so quarter of hour before must not leave off doing be loth to leave table before master came took up blotting pad laid down again arranged pen lingered over job come yet george cried astonished 'do think that yesterday shock have be too much for ' ' believe be killed ' said old clerk 'killed be what have done went on muttering mumbling `` cried when george took up letter p ' r'aps be dead yet have stepped into shoe just yet let letter alone ' 'not dead yet hope not george began to open letter regardless of surly disrespectful word one may forgive good deal to fidelity 'he will go on for good many year after have got money back for ' of ' checkley corrected 'have got money back for ' turned to go back to own office then turned again came back to table laid hand upon leaned forward shaking head said with trembling voice never think mr austin of black ingratitood of thing that done know that eat bread took money ' when checkley be greatly moved grammar went back to early day before be confidential clerk ' daresay be ungrateful have be thinking hitherto of stronger adjective 'well have agreed of have that be done in office one in office done with help of one out one who know way pointed to empty chair one who 'd known way for long time ten year at least 'things certainly seem to point way ' point to ' must have added refrained old man shook head again went on 'they have eaten bread done work call mr austin ask plain call black ingratitood ' be sure be have doubt about ingratitude see checkley that vice be not one court recognise be not one denounced in decalogue there be good deal to consider in fact before get to ingratitude be probably criminal conspiracy be felony be thing to be punished by long term of penal servitude when have worried through got conspirator under lock key will proceed to consider ingratitude there be also bad form of absence of proper feeling of want of consideration of trouble give patience will have to consider business from point of view presently ' must scoff snigger at mr austin if be scoffin ' sniggerin might bring bad luck because know there be others besides determined to bring thing to right issue george put down paper looked at importunate person what did mean old man shrunk shrivelled grew small trembled over remained standing with hand on table leaning forward 'eight year ago went on 'when that other business happened when mr arundel cut lucky will have nothing said against mr arundel go to own room ' 'one word will speak if be dead will not stay long here will stay so long a be alive though be partner only one word sir if mr arundel have run away 'd ' be partner instead of ' 'well sir s'pose 'd be found out after be made partner instead of before george pointed to door old man seemed off head be with terror checkley obeyed at door turned head grinned quite theatrical grin expressed malignity pleasure of anticipation be matter with old man surely terror who in office except have control of letter who drew that quarterly cheque surely terror be not until half past eleven mr dering arrived at office usually passed through clerk office outside own morning entered by own private door opened on stair one have key except generally proceeded in orderly methodical manner to hang up hat coat take off glove place umbrella in stand throw open safe sit down in chair adjusted at certain distance of three inch so to put on glass then without haste dawdling to begin work of day be very certain that to approach work always in exactly same way save nerve unmethodical workman get to office at varying hour travel by different route now on omnibus now on foot doe nothing to day in same way that did yesterday break up early at sixty talk of retiring at seventy be past work morning mr dering did nothing in proper order first be nearly two hour late next came in by private door george rose to greet stopped because most wonderful thing partner made a if did not observe presence eye went through george in creepy ghostly fashion junior partner stood still silent

pocket window beside safe be open sat down looking out into square at moment checkley opened door softly after wont to bring in more letter stopped short seeing master thus seated head in hand at window recognised symptom of yesterday rapt look open eye saw nothing crept on tiptoe across room 'hush ' whispered ' move speak went like yesterday make least noise will come round presently 'what be ' 'kind of fit be trouble done yah ingratitood ' must have hissed word have sibilant ca hiss without material trouble be what be done ' stood watching in silence for about ten minute office be like court of sleeping princess then checkley sneezed mr dering probably mistook sneeze for kiss for closed eye for moment opened again arose once more grave austere nodded cheerfully took off hat hung on peg buttoned coat threw open safe evidently remembered nothing of what have just passed 'you be early george said 'you be before be unusual however early bird know ' 'before for once be quite well morning none worse for yesterday trouble ' be always well ' said checkley with cheerfulness assumed 'nobody ever see ill get ill not eats a hearty a five twenty walk a upright be perfectly well to best of knowledge yesterday business upset for time did not keep awake yet be certainly very great trouble have news suppose that brought here earlier than usual 'nothing new since yesterday ' 'and feel pretty confident ' feel like sleuth hound understand pleasure of chase long to be on scent again a for edmund gray be a good a in prison already 'good be for moment shaken out of myself be bewildered be unable to look at fact of case calmly for first time in life wanted advice well now understand what great thing be that profession exists for assistance of men in trouble how must world

have made recommend to landlord be clever man bold man be in hurry about putting hand upon complete case before strike make delay will be none will hear everything from day to day from hour to hour ' left alone mr dering returned to paper work at half past one checkley looked in 'not going to take lunch morning ' 'lunch have only just ' mr dering looked at watch 'bless most extraordinary morning

joyfuller be pleasant too why ca drink port wine be real wine when can afford ' be past three in afternoon when george returned not quite so confident in bearing yet full of news 'if be quite ready to

woman whom saw yesterday well sir said be unlucky master have be here very morning have be long gone have only missed by hour so asked if must return day knew nothing then asked if must let write leave note for to consented rather unwillingly went in therefore wrote note at mr gray table asked to call here on important business marked note urgent think there can be harm in then looked about room be one of old wainscoted room furnished simply everything solid good long table nearly a large a one of yours solid chair solid sofa three four picture on wall bookcase full of book sign of occupation letter flower everything covered with dust although old woman be there must have wished to examine paper on table presence of old woman forbade that dishonourable act did however look at book made most curious discovery mr edmund gray be socialist book be on socialism be in french german english book of socialism picture on wall be portrait of distinguished socialist be that wonderful did one ever hear before of socialism forgery going together ' 'not too fast have yet connected edmund gray with forgery at present only know that name be used ' bit be coming to after leaving chamber went into city saw mr elli first of none of stock have be sold have have three month have not disposed of must have met with unforeseen difficulty let see ' mr dering be now thoroughly alert weakness of morning have completely passed away 'what difficulty upon word can not understand that there must have be have got paper from respectable solicitor through respectable broker course be perfectly plain rogue often break down through inability to see strength of own case mr elli have ascertained that of dividend be received by bank therefore called on manager now be prepared for surprise ' forgery ' 'yes forgery be nine ten year since sent letter to manager saw introducing client edmund gray gentleman who be desirous of opening private account paid in small sum of money have be lying to credit ever since have not be touched in february last received letter from again in march april forwarding certificate requesting to receive dividend with own hand placed paper in bank saw letter

' 'certainly told everything be in substance line take partner say alleges that paper have be procured by forgery say that letter of introduction be forgery very good may be so have opened account for customer who brought introduction from best solicitor in london whose handwriting know well recognise in letter allegation must not be enough in for to take action until civil criminal action be brought until be concluded must not refuse to treat customer like rest at same time will take what step can to inquire into customer antecedent 'quite right ' said mr dering ' asked next what must do if customer sent for paper said that if action be brought must probably be served with sub poena duce tecum making keep produce paper a forming part of document in case 'certainly certainly manager know law ' went on a regard cheque will pay receive until restrained 'in other word said what expected for own action now 'we might apply to judge in chamber for attachment garnishee order must be pendente interlocutory proceeding in action a yet have not brought action at partner ' mr dering rubbed hand cheerfully think have done very well so far be clumsy scoundrel after thought to divert suspicion by using name thought to cover with name must have sold realised without least delay very good have now got hand upon paper must have complicated matter horribly have stock be sold transferred so far be safe because see after what have heard bank must certainly not give up without letting know must warn must put man off must ask awkward question about oh think be safe quite safe

separate small lot order of court necessary for transaction have now nothing simple question before how did man edmund gray get possession of property ' sat in silence for few minute then went on quietly 'to lose money must be heavy blow for not fortune quarter large sum have plenty left have hungry expectant heir people be wealthy yet very heavy loss then to be robbed have always wondered why left off hanging robber ought to be hanged one who invades sacred right of property must be killed killed without hope of mercy ' spoke with earnestness of sincerity lose property must not be ruin to yet must be terrible must take so many year out of past life year mean so much money saved forty thousand pound mean ten year of past not taken away so must be ten year younger ten year of work annihilated must forgive man who must so injure never ' ' understand ' said george 'fortunately will get paper back fact of possession must connect possessor with fraud who be can be warned already

case complete suppose want more complete case for court of justice ' a for be not lawyer a city man if clerk of mine be in such suspicious position a young austin must ask for full explanation have got actual proof see that athelstan did thing ' beg pardon sir samuel be only clerk be great city knight know what better proof want see young austin pretending not to know who edmund gray be then going up to chamber to meet pal athelstan arundel ai that proof tell that same hand have be at work in forgery be that hand young arundel ' 'checkley see that be greatly interested in matter ' must give ah twenty pound yes twenty hard earned pound to see two young gentleman in dock where will be where will be repeated trembling voice cracked with old age seemed unequally wedded to malignity of word expression 'one of young gentleman said sir samuel brother in law other unless business prevents will be brother in law before many day will therefore understand that endeavour will be to keep out of dock 'the job will be only half complete without still to see young austin drove out of place with disgrace same a other one be why must be something something to think about afterwards checkley went away sir samuel sat thinking what be best to be done like everybody else quite believed in athelstan guilt granted that fact saw clearly that there be very black looking case against against george austin what must be done must consult wife did so 'what will elsie say asked 'yet sooner later must be told suppose will be task can wait little do go to morrow morning to mr dering tell sooner know better now understand why mr checkley be so joyous when arrived at salutation why proposed that toast in morning sir samuel saw brother whispered in ear whole of case a prepared drawn up by checkley 'what do say ' asked when have concluded ' say nothing ' mr dering have heard point brought out one after other without least emotion 'there be nothing to be said dear brother evidence 'there be evidence be supposition if athelstan committed first forgery there be evidence to show that did if have be living year life of profligacy in england have evidence to contrary in own possession if be tempted by poverty if young austin be also tempted by poverty if two together separately must undertake under temptation risk so terrible see whole case be built upon if ' hold together at point be perfect case who else must do checkley certainly must not that old man old servant agree with checkley must not do not because be too old age have nothing to do with crime because be old servant must not do because be not clever enough kind of thing want grasp vision checkley have got might be confederate may have stopped letter be miserly might be tempted by money yet think possible ' 'no can not believe that ' said sir samuel be quite a difficult to believe thing of young austin oh know everything be possible belongs to good family have own people to think of be engaged have always led blameless life yet yet everything be possible ' have known case in city where blameless seeming be only pretence cloak most deplorable case assure cloak to hide profligate life think if be so must not be deceived outward sign in such case be not wanting know face of profligate open concealed young austin present sign of anything regular blameless life for reason say ought to believe incapable of dishonourable action have be in practice for fifty year fifty year during long period know not how many case what be called family case have be in hand have have in room trembling old profligate of seventy ready to pay price rather than let thing be known to old wife who belief in daughter who worship have have middle aged man of standing in city imploring to buy back paper at price must stamp with infamy have have young man on knee begging never to let father know forgery theft villainy seduction what not have have woman of age sitting in chair confessing wickedness do for most part with hard face cold eye not like men with shame tear men fall being tempted by want of money mean loss of pride self respect position comfort there ought to have be clause in litany from want of money at age on occasion good lord deliver ' 'true most true ' said sir samuel want of money will say next time go to church from want of money at age particularly when one be getting on in year have title to keep up good lord deliver very good indeed brother will quote in city to morrow have to make speech at helmet maker company will quote very remarkable saying of yours mr dering smiled gravely ' simple saying indeed greatest temptation of be want of money why there be nothing that average man will not do rather than be without money be helpless be slave be in contempt without money austin tell be tempted by want of money think not be poor have enough to keep be frugal have simple want have never felt want of money think that be tempted by poverty everything be possible be possible brother silence if speak about may injure young man supposing to be innocent if be guilty will put on guard mind will show foolish mercy none when find guilty party more reason therefore for silence ' sir samuel promised have parted with secret have given into keeping of woman chapter xv who be edmund gray athelstan laughed on first hearing of thing be on tuesday evening day after discovery george be dining with laughed loud long with of old bitterness beo note be in safe along be who put there say old checkley with pretty finger put there ' soon a other business be over chief must tell mother athelstan ought to come from will say nothing to elsie just yet will learn that be home again that name be clear again at same moment confess must be pleased to make confess that suspicion be hasty unfounded at same time did wrong to go away ought to have stuck to post a for other business one think with something like satisfaction of wise old lawyer losing forty thousand pound made sit up did for man to sit up indicates presence of deep emotion lost forty thousand pound who hold so strongly to sanctity of property forty thousand pound 'well will recover certificate get new one in place ' suppose so share ca be lost stolen really can meantime there may be difficulty must try to find forger have yet occurred to that checkley be only man who have have control of letter access at time to office 'it have 'checkley be not exactly fox be jackal therefore doe somebody dirty work for at wage be way with jackal know eight year ago tried to make little pile by little forgery did not commit forgery be sure did jackal only forgot that note be numbered so when remembered that put back now friend forger who be doubt begging letter writer have devised elaborate scheme for getting hold of share ignorant that be of value 'well have drawn dividend for four month 'that be something see hoped to get hold of thirty eight thousand pound be same hand at work infer from

there see signed edmund gray what do think of for impudence in forger george read letter through carefully be whole column long be in advocacy of socialism pure simple one be surprised that editor have allowed to appear probably be influenced by tone of be generous cheerful optimistic there be not slightest ring of bitterness about 'we who look ' said 'for coming disappearance of property not

through evening through play elsie saw nothing mr dering engaged in daylight somnambulism saw a george described opening safe closing again afterwards wholly forgetful of what have done thought about

word with to drag out make clearer story teller know that mere telling of story turn character who before be mere shadow shapeless shadow into creature of flesh blood therefore in morning began upon thought haunted 'athelstan ' said 'do know anything about somnambulism ' ' knew man once in california who shot grizzly when be sleep walking at least said so that be sum of knowledge on subject want to know if people often walk about in daytime unconscious 'they do be called wool gathering ' beeriously athelstan consider george saw mr dering arrive in state of unconsciousness saw nobody in room opened safe placed paper there then locked safe then sat down at window presently awoke became again if did once might do again ' 'well then ' 'you heard yesterday about letter placard socialist tract now checkley must do that must must ' 'well mr dering must if have that attack once might have again again why constantly complains of forgetting thing 'but letter yesterday be addressed to edmund gray how do connect edmund gray with edward dering ' ' know dear brother more think of business more persuaded be checkley be not prime mover even confederate ' 'the same hand have doubtless be at work throughout if not checkley aid to make hand possible successful who be there look at malignity with try to fix on one else 'that may be because be afraid of being fixed upon consider point about control of letter business must only be done by one through whose hand passed letter 'checkley be only person possible 'yes understands that make horribly afraid therefore lie with might in order to pas on suspicion to person george think guilty well if be trying to find out man must try different plan altogether brother have work to do took out directly after early breakfast when elsie be left alone began again to think about mr dering strange daylight somnambulism about continual fit of forgetfulness about odd thing found on table in safe connected with edmund gray checkley must not have

down scheme invent system for glorified humanity let leave to will be a far above brother a be already above holder defender of property ' elsie looked at little gathering five forty with little smile be then already far above holder defender of property again thought 'what if word be heard in lincoln inn ' then can property be destroyed at practical question one sat upright coughed looked interested preacher have often enough declaimed upon evil of property seldom spoke of practical way perhaps time have come 'there be friend several way be already beginning to be understood to be worked irish politician who wanted irish vote have shown world how to destroy property in land believe that example will be followed be evil day for holder of property when government interfered

followed at distance when be beside athelstan whispered be man 'd swear to anywhere be man sent to bank athelstan heard in unbounded astonishment that man why be mr dering 'let follow ' whispered together on opposite side of road good heaven be most wonderful lose sight of ' to follow be perfectly easy because mr dering turned to right to left marched straight on through great turnstile across

against old villain very likely young governor most likely donation on account of same job very likely old villain a for athelstan returned to lincoln inn field where evening being fine sun warm place quiet except for child at play walked up down east sunny side for hour turning thing over in mind for see if mr dering went through form of robbing finding out robbery coldly suffering blame to fall upon then mr dering must be one of most phenomenally wicked of living men if mr dering robbed did not know then mr dering must be mad again if such thing must be done on small scale might be done on larger scale with same result namely suspicion to fall upon blameless person obloquy to gather round name for in case simply to be charged be almost a fatal a to be convicted perfect impunity for 'this be not own writing forgery ' said man who have be robbed then who be forger none bare suspicion becomes certainty in mind of who be once that man friend life be cankered at outset thought of own life bitterness of alienation exile never time for eight year when must explain reason of exile debt cultivation of wild oat failure to pas examination anything must do for reason except suspicion of forgery athelstan be cheerful young man seldom allowed to be cast down by blow of fate nevertheless during whole time of exile drop of bitterness poisoned cup be that must not tell whole story because world must believe more than half namely contained accusation when one walk about thinking there come time when seems good to think longer mind can only get certain amount out of case at one sitting amount absorbed best thing be to go on to something else athelstan went on to dinner left sister to care of young man dined by took steak at holborn restaurant with evening paper considered professionally after dinner returned to subject perhaps must get step farther perhaps on account of sweet influence of dinner got farther at here be astonishing fact how to account for have seen by one of two way malignity unspeakable madness madness of very curious kind madness of man whose calm cold judgment have made appear to friend a one with intellect far above ordinary weakness of humanity mr dering mad then chancellor of exchequer speaker of house of common president of royal society president of institute of civil engineer cambridge professor of mathematics men might be mad a

what doe mean be very much troubled about letter on saturday came here informed that wedding must be held on wednesday just a if nothing have happened foretold that must be present athelstan must give away athelstan be very disquieting letter because dear do think must of must possibly be wrong have be wrong from very beginning in athelstan case must sir samuel be wrong in george case ' bey dear mother be impossible case unhappily be too clear to admit of doubt sir samuel with long experience must not be wrong hilda dear what can elsie mean 'we have be talking about through breakfast only conclusion can come to be that there be going to be smothering up of whole business mr dering who have be terribly put out with case must have consented to smother up matter think that paper have be returned with money received on dividend coupon mr dering have agreed to take further proceeding now if must do athelstan of course must come under kind of act of indemnity a note be never used by be returned to owner becomes a easy to recognise innocence a of other man do see ' 'yes will not make innocent ' 'certainly not make difference in world oh there be family everywhere who have have to smother up thing in order to escape scandal well hope will agree with accept invitation suppose must how about removing suspicion 'oh be only elsie enthusiastic way will go on if like believing that george have nothing to do with will have inducement to live honestly for future can easily pretend to believe that athelstan be always innocent can persuade at least hope can persuade to go abroad sir samuel kindly say that will advance hundred pound in order to get rid of then there will be scandal everybody will be satisfied a for relation with elsie husband can arrange afterwards perhaps will agree to live in distant suburb say redhill chislehurst walthamstow so that there may be good excuse for never having to house because smothering smothering can no longer have same feeling towards elsie a before obstinate infatuation for man exasperates only to think of have least intention of being on intimate relation with forger who have only just escaped being convict sir samuel entirely agrees with ' mother sighed must have wished that be mistaken perhaps after there may be something elsie have found out unexpected ' beay miracle at once dear mother be just a likely to happen ' first to arrive at office in afternoon be elsie carrying handbag be going to bring brother elsie ' said mr dering 'where be what be important business with suppose be something about wretched forgery really

have to be paid must be done in sight of so that there must be possible margin left for malignity suspicion 'this business ' said 'concerns honour of two men who be dearer to than world beside remember that nothing short of must make do what have be doing what be now doing honour oh honour think what mean to respect dignity everything happiness of home pride of child compared with one man honour what matter man humiliation what matter loss of man self respect what matter loss of dignity honour mr dering think of honour ' bowed head gravely wondering what be to follow ' man honour a say elsie be greatest thing in world to compared with man self respect need not must say a general principle be considered at self respect may be regained unless honour be lost ' that then mr dering when hear have to say promise to remember that oh if there be thousand reason formerly why must not pain by single word there be ten thousand now although understand not ' 'why elsie be troubling little head about trifle will not offend say ' 'it be so important thing ' went on have asked mother sister sir samuel to meet here at four o'clock in order that too may hear a well a athelstan be with george have one two person to introduce to ' seems to promise meeting of interest so far a one may judge from preamble of more than common importance well elsie be quite in hand if brother between will kindly produce forger give back property will be truly grateful ' will see mr dering a for gratitude oh here be sir samuel ' city knight appeared large important shook hand with elsie brother took up position on hearth rug behind brother chair 'well elsie ' said be to hear something very important indeed if one may judge by tone of letter be imperative ' important indeed sir samuel ' next

received greeting mr dering rose 'athelstan said 'it be eight year since left ' held out hand 'presently mr dering ' said athelstan looked round room mother trembled dropped head put handkerchief to eye said nothing sister looked out of window sir samuel took notice of at athelstan took chair client chair placed so a to have mother sister at side be not therefore compelled to look at across table sat down remained in silence motionless court be now complete mr dering sat in chair before table expectant judicial sir samuel stood behind mr arundel hilda two lady sat at open window elsie stood opposite to mr dering on other side of table handbag before looked like counsel about to open case for plaintiff athelstan plaintiff naturally occupied client chair on mr dering left george a naturally other plaintiff stood behind 'now elsie if please ' mr dering began ' will want clerk checkley to be present if please ' mr dering touched bell clerk appeared stood before like criminal pale trembling looked at master appealingly hand hung beside yet not word of accusation have be brought against 'lord man alive cried sir samuel on earth have come over ' checkley shook head sadly made reply ' want to ask question two checkley ' said elsie quietly have told mr dering have told sir samuel that saw brother furtively put parcel presumably stolen note into safe at very moment when be charging with forgery now consider be very serious thing to say be direct statement of fact before charge rested on suspicion alone be fact consider carefully may have be mistaken of may make mistake 'it be true gospel truth see place parcel along sideways in safe parcel found afterwards in safe containing note word be confident manner be halting havery well next told sir samuel that brother have be living in low suburb of london with profligate companion that have be even going about in rag tatter 'yes did told sir samuel what heard mr carstone told 'd better ask only told what heard george went out returned bringing with mr freddy carstone looked round room stared with surprise at mr dering said nothing have be warned to say nothing except in answer to question mr carstone ' elsie asked 'how long be since met brother after return to england ' 'about three week ago met be in holborn invited into salutation tavern ' tell mr checkley here anything about way of living ' ' remember saying foolishly that looked too respectable to have come from america said in joke that believed have be in camberwell time 'nothing about profligacy ' 'nothing at 'nothing about rag tatter 'certainly not in fact knew nothing at about athelstan life during eight year that have be away 'have anything to say checkley still stick to parcel story do very well to camberwell profligacy story ' checkley made answer then there be question made great point about certain imitation of mr dering writing found in drawer of athelstan table ' be there in brother hand ' 'george have something to say on point ' 'only be not long articled at time table be taken from room in sat placed here for special work now imitation of mr dering handwriting be made by clerk in joke remember perfectly be written at back of letter addressed to ' mr dering went to safe produced bundle containing paper in case unrolled bundle placed content on table everybody be now serious lady dering looked out of window no longer mr arundel have drawn chair to table elsie picked out paper containing imitation 'tell ' said 'if remember mind everybody bundle of paper have never be shown to george tell name of correspondent ' be leonard henryson ' gave paper to mr dering see ' said lawyer gave to brother who passed on to wife who gave to mother mr arundel laid on table raised veil next point ' said elsie 'be about athelstan whereabouts during last eight year one letter be received by mr dering four year ago have already shown to will let read letter aloud for to hear ' be in bundle with stopped note bowed assent read 'twelve thousand pound cried sir samuel 'twelve thousand pound have good heaven 'all have in world ' said elsie 'and for child who refused to believe that brother must be villain all have in world ' eye filled with tear dashed aside went on 'he be in state four year ago that suppose will no longer be denied next question be when did return to country george left room again returned with young gentleman gentleman ' elsie continued 'comes from messrs chenery son banker of new york london have brought letter with will kindly let see sir be ' explained ' letter of credit brought over by brother from california see date june th of year mr dering read gave to brother who gave to wife a before 'it say that mr athelstan arundel one of staff of certain californian paper will leave new

checkley ' said master do want gentleman longer name have not pleasure of knowing ' come ' said mr carstone who be nearest 'you know name surely george warned with look subsided into silence ' think will want mr carstone ' elsie replied will kindly take chair wait now sir samuel think be right in saying that belief in guilt of george rested entirely on supposed complicity of athelstan that gone what becomes of charge also there be doubt believe that one hand one hand alone have committed whole long list of letter forgery if therefore athelstan must not execute second business how must do first have more than argument for ' sir samuel coughed mr arundel sighed 'as regard charge against george apart from supposed intimacy with imaginary criminal only suspicious thing be that may have
