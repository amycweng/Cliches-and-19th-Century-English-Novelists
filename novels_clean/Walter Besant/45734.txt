in peace chapter xv how mr be discharged after poor mr deborah death lesson came to sudden stop have never be resumed of perspicacity of style have often admired in modern divine might have fallen to lot to enrich narrative have continued in course of single double book keeping be not clever said mr esther like deborah be always clever one a well a beauty gave right to little temper poor dear can not teach astronomy because one star be to exactly like do know aught about book keeping except that be very useful necessary science therefore kitty thou must go untaught for matter think know a much a woman need ever know be to read to write one ought not to expect of woman such exactness in spelling a of scholar to cipher to moderate degree a may enable to add up bill grief to think be growing up so tall straight without learning how to make so much a single cordial strong water with mean what chance of teaching to toss pancake fold omelette dish yorkshire pudding be then that began to console for ignorance trouble even bear mind for late loss by reading clarissa book doctor ever watchful in interest of virtue presented to mr esther with speech of condolence said that be work whose perusal must not fail most strongly to console spirit to dispose for resignation while for purity of moral for justice of observation for knowledge of human heart be unequalled in language then made digression compared work with ancient greek romance adventure said be to be found in heliodorus story told by apuleius of cupid psyche be exquisitely pathetic yet none of earlier writer must be compared even named in same breath with mr richardson who reminded especially of sophocles in tenderness with prepared mind of audience for impending tragedy must not alter abate seeing that be will of necessity there be nothing went on to say more calculated to inspire to strengthen sentiment of virtue in breast of young especially in young of feminine sex than contemplation of clarissa virtue lovelace wickedness be greatly edified by praise coming from so great scholar one so eminently fitted to discourse on virtue received work prepared so far a be concerned to partake of food for reflection of satisfying kind so that reader quickly lay aside work while meditates for few day on what have read be supplied by pious drelincourt on death hervey meditation among tomb young night thought after dinner dear said mr esther will read aloud to stop if shut eye in order to hear better good book must be carefully listened to read very slowly otherwise lesson may be overlooked must be sad pity after good doctor trouble in first reading book for scholarship kitty what passion nay what ardour for virtue animates that reverend heart can not pause here to ask whether if mr richardson have chosen to depict to life character of clergyman who have fallen into such way a uncle with sin folly degradation doctor must have laid to heart ala fear not know not a be still go dreaming be something better than seem to others have second unreal self shaft of satirist seem to pierce heart of others be sure that many lovelace fresh from ruin of clarissa if indeed there must be creature so incomparable must have read great romance with tear of pity indignation otherwise race of lovelace must long since have become extinct received therefore clarissa expecting edification not joy even put aside for week because mr esther hardly felt at first strong enough to begin new book might flood mind with new idea make unsettled at last however felt that must no longer postpone obeying doctor only short chapter dear to begin with heaven how will struggle through eight long volume will be ever thankful that be duty to read dear delightful page of great romance may judge of joy when read on day after day hurrying over household work in morning neglecting walk abroad wasting candlelight in evening more to enjoy laid aside book from time to time while wept over author pathetic scene oh horrid usage of poor clarissa be ever girl more barbarously served be ever man so wicked a lover be parent ever so blinded by prejudice have girl ever so unkind brother ever so perverse sister thought of day long at night dreamed of image of clarissa be never absent from brain everything in book be a real to a adventure of robinson crusoe of christian on pilgrimage from city of destruction so long a reading of immortal book lasted read page after page twice thrice four time over to get out of fullest measure of sympathy sorrow delight loved with clarissa sorrow be ours breathed talked clarissa mr esther even prayed believe though book be already printed therefore be too late for prayer that poor sweet innocent might escape clutch of wicked lover who sure be more demon than man carried thought of clarissa even to church with invited friend to share with new found joy solomon stallabras be always ready to weep with over dish of tea never man have heart more formed for tenderest sensibility pity that nose be so broad so much turned up otherwise natural tenderness might have be manifested in countenance while read gazed upon face be fain from time to time to draw forth handkerchief wipe tear from streaming eye stop miss kitty must say let pause awhile let come back to virtue ourselves be too much spectacle of so much youth beauty so much innocence fate of poor clarissa read by nymph whose lot be so below merit be too much mr pimpernel be indeed in way while read poet whose imagination a became profession be strong mixed up clarissa with imagined that ending might be in way similar to of heroine now with solomon stallabras to think be to believe nothing be wanting lovelace believe that waited about market in hope of finding lurking in corner perhaps even suspected poor sir mile have found assured mr esther fully intended to pierce to heart with spit skewer from one of butcher stall adding that must be sweet for to die even from cart at tyburn for sake lovelace be trying to make leave shelter with mr esther sometimes sir mile lackington came to join in reading found wanting in sensibility without quality richardson novel can not be enjoyed inclined rather to low humour make men enjoy fielding tom jones smollett peregrine pickle work full doubt of coarse vitality men like quite wanting in delicate shade of feeling commend author to delicacy of gentlewoman to think that old samuel richardson be nothing printer by trade heaven denied most precious gift of creation to such tender poetic soul a of solomon stallabras vouchsafed to bestow upon printer mechanical printer who if be not paid for setting up type yet employed common workman superintended labour paid wage put profit into purse seems incredible then shakespeare be only actor sunshine of genius said solomon fall upon child of lowly a well a of rich be scion of fetter lane sometimes indeed sir mile lackington be so wanting in delicacy so rude a to laugh at for tear cry over richardson said if be to bring jones warrant must laugh 'tom jones said mr esther be clearly work of coarseness lady wish to laugh law of decorum forbid unrestrained mirth to female of good breeding fielding may suit pewter pot of tavern richardson go best with silver service of mansion looked about a if room be mansion cupboard be lined with silver dish sir mile laughed again give pewter mug well filled often filled said with 'tom jones to bear company ask more 'clarissa silver service may remain with lady strange however that folk must prefer printer to gentleman why fielding come of honourable house gentle blood replied mr esther doe not unfortunately always bring gift of poetry sensibility be of gentle birth sir mile yet own that love not richardson many great author have be of lowly extraction mr stallabras be saying finely yesterday that sunshine of genius fall upon child of poor a often a upon of rich solomon inclined head coloured sir mile laughed again in easy fashion said mr richardson know nothing about polite ton men be master tradesman disguised in sword scarlet coat be religious tradesman wicked tradesman so forth be not gentleman can not talk think walk write act like gentleman if want to read about polite society let at least ask gentleman to write for sir mile read little yet judgment be generally right since have seen society of richardson wrote have learned that be right in case for richardson pathetic powerful a be have certainly never be among class whose manner conversation attempted to portray presently finished clarissa with flood of tear

generally take two to make quarrel few men be so perverse a deliberately to force duel upon against will yet be what harry temple old schoolfellow old friend of whom once held so high opinion so great

drinking wine with when ought to have gone to bed now wine to one who be jealous be like oil upon fire have lord for part retired to durdans a might very properly have done seeing lateness of hour

admonished perhaps one know not even tried to set before reasonableness of father rebuke perhaps a sequel seems to show kept silence resolving to have own way somehow however that might be will ceased to molest for time be even in hope that have seen hopelessness of desire day went on without other visit from did not seek out upon terrace in assembly room poor nancy prediction be however entirely fulfilled for will must not by persuasion of hers be induced at first to abstain from showing in public to be sure did not run indian muck among dancer became terror of whole company for rough boorishness be certainly unknown before in polite assembly did not try to be even decently polite be boorish not like boor like czar of russia with proud sense of own position behaved a if be at epsom well young squire among villager who looked up to a hero natural king if walked upon terrace pushed elbowed men jolted lady stepped upon train pushed aside dangling cane deranged wig a if nobody be to be considered when be present sometimes went into card room took hand then if be tempted to give antagonist lie direct gave if lost said rude thing about honesty be so strong carried so big cudgel for time nobody dared to check because see by nash order gentleman wore sword now although be possible to challenge man run through what be to do with one who perhaps must refuse challenge yet must on provocation being horribly strong cudgel adversary on spot of course kind of thing must not last went on just a long a forbearance of gentleman allowed then be brought to end a for will during first few day have not least consideration for one be to give way to caprice have already remarked upon very singular love young men of rank seem to have for chucking under chin young woman of lower class be very well known at epsom well that many gentleman rose early in morning in order to enjoy pastime upon chin of higglers who brought fruit egg fowl vegetable from farmhouse from six to nine chin chucking not actually upon parade terrace close by among tree on step of house beside pond be amusement in full flow many of higglers be comely red cheeked damsel who thought fine thus to be noticed by quality suppose harm came of save little pampering of conceit vanity of young girl so that might dream of gentleman instead of yeoman aspire beyond rank instead of remembering word of catechism to learn labour to do duty in own station of life to attract attention of dozen young fellow to have following one about even though one carried basket full of egg for sale to listen to compliment to endure that chin chucking suppose thing be to taste of girl because a cicely told there be great competition among who must carry basket to well now master will be quite at home from village experience with pastime speedily fell in with to annoyance discomfiture of london beau fribbles for still acting upon principle that epsom be own parish village where be sultan great bashaw heyduc grand seigneur at once took upon right of paying attention to of damsel without reference to previous preference exasperated fair higglers drove beau nearly mad yet because be so strong cudgel be so thick none durst interfere have since thought in reflecting over poor will history that there be very few position in life more dangerous to young man than of only son of country squire to have taste for learning polite society to live constantly on estate for among rough farmer labourer there can be opposition public feeling upon conduct however foolish ungoverned of young man rustic clown be very humble servant nay almost slave tremble at frown if lift stick expect cudgelling a for woman girl of village poor thing be simply honoured by nod word estate will be field will be cottage hare rabbit partridge pheasant will be even very men woman will be nay be already wherever go be saluted even in church people rise to do reverence hat be doffed reverence paid if walk field ride upon road day supposing be so unhappy a to remain always upon own estate be made to feel greatness until come to believe like king louis xv that there be one in world must bow to order nothing that desire must have speaking with respect due to benefactor think that sir robert man of singular good feeling high breeding be greatly to blame in not sending son to travel in way to make mix with equal superior for character a will be formed insensibly man doe not become selfish boorish at once therefore parent did not notice until be forced upon what world deplored self will boorishness of only son to last think that lady levett looked upon a young man of excellent heart though stubborn will marry have said therefore be war to death because a know must not possibly marry be secret at epsom that young autocrat have said word in fact used in public insulting harry temple upon very terrace before company warn said keep away from kitty be going to be wife have told so therefore hand off why will harry replied good naturedly what if refuse sha refuse have said will marry will replied refuse be only whimsical trick filly be alike hand off master harry why cried peggy baker what pretty genteel speech to be sure oh mr levett happy be woman who will be wife such kindness of disposition such sweetness such gallantry such sensibility know what mean said will swearing big oath value word opinion not brass farden more than value powder paint patch be alike blacksmith sue be worth hundred of ye peggy burst out laughing will strode away did not like to be laughed at yet must not help being intolerably rude when found will although made laughing stock terror of place ceased to molest be more easy in mind certainly must not have be pleasant to walk on terrace even to go to assembly if one have feared to meet rough bearish inamorato who might have insulted one gentleman with one in most intolerable manner however evening be generally safe time because then loved to sit in tavern playing four over pipe tankard with country parson even town tradesman who must share beer be complaisant with mood be worse than case of harry temple because a have said before must not hope did to bring to reason sometimes thought wildly of dr powlett establishment suppose that whole force of house have succeeded in putting into chain strait waistcoat be certainly doubtful besides so wicked thing must not be done twice what assurance have of good behaviour on release must promise will be always ready to promise having more regard to truth than ourang outang when be free with cudgel in hand what must not do have said that be prodigiously strong besides being fierce masterful of aspect made men give way to also got reputation for being stronger than perhaps really be for when a continually happened booth be put on down for wrestling singlestick quarterstaff boxing other trial of skill strength will must always go sit out whole game then challenge victor whom always conquered coming off hero of day to be sure be whispered that contest be generally arranged by promise of crown to be decided in favour of will seems strange suppose there be men who for crown will not only sell fight on bet have be made also take sound drubbing a well if have dispute with gentleman be impossible for to exchange two word without causing dispute must immediately propose to settle affair with cudgel fist now gentleman must be ready to fight street bully light porter in london with weapon if necessary what sort of society must be in gentleman must take off coat wig engage with fist club on smallest quarrel be so rude overbearing that company began to be positively afraid of going to terrace assembly room indeed think must have driven whole of visitor away in body for timely interference of lord chudleigh sir mile lackington be day after open insult to harry temple who must not call out son of former guardian old playfellow therefore two resolved that there must be end of behaviour be bruited abroad that step of serious nature be going to be taken there have be found man be said to bell cat be even whispered that prize fighter of stupendous strength dexterity resolution have be brought down expressly from london in order to insult will levett receive challenge for singlestick fist quarterstaff instantly accept thereupon give village bantam cock so mighty drubbing that must not dare again to show face among company indeed think be best thing must have be done sincerely wish have done lord chudleigh sir mile must not treat gentleman even so great cub clown with other than treatment due to gentleman therefore resolved upon open public expostulation admonition mindful of big cudgel broke law of well put on sword before came together on terrace looking grave stern a becomes who have duty of disagreeable kind to perform to see excitement of company expected believe nothing short of battle between lord chudleigh sir mile on one hand armed with sword will on other grasping trusty cudgel cudgel in hand against two combatant must have be mighty awkward weapon fortunately gentleman of will kind entertain healthy repugnance to cold steel be about twelve o'clock in forenoon when will masterful forcing way shoulder first among crowd found brought up short by two gentleman round be gathered circle of bystander increased rapidly till be twenty thirty deep now then cried what be meaning of let pas will ye lord lord a lord chudleigh made reply will growling that freeborn englishman be a good a lord baronet in public way tried to pas through then be seized by coat collar by sir mile whose arm be a strong a own hark ye said baronet want few word with young cub will lifted head in amazement here be man quite a strong a who dared to address a cub find that go about well continued baronet be place of entertainment for lady gentleman insulting pushing behaving with more courtesy than if be in own stableyard now sirrah be not for respect have for father must

running through with sword contrary to rule of well gentleman a have said wore sword on occasion here sir mile touched sword hilt now sir take word of advice try to behave like gentleman upon word of honour will be driven out of well with horsewhip by hand of common groom of place proper companion will swore prodigiously refrained from using cudgel indeed prospect of cold steel mightily cooled
