be bankrupt death will no longer help probus where must go ' told that thought of dublin where might get into orchestra of theatre so after little discussion be settled jenny always generous undertook to provide for alice in absence gave sum of money for present necessity stayed there day in evening played at concert in assembly room after concert took supper with jenny during supper jenny entertained with fuller description of wretch from whose hand be trying to rescue there be turn trick of villainy that jenny did not know made excuse for knowing so much be part of education to hear continually talk of thing make up disguise in be impossible to recognise arrange that respectable people will swear to having be mile away at time of crime practise on ignorance of on cunning of others prey upon mankind time behind villain stand greater villain behind humble footpad stand captain behind captain stand thief taker behind thief taker stand money lender unseen must surely be to advantage of law must tackle greater villain first cart load of gentleman like mr probus on way to tyburn must perhaps be more useful than many cartload of poor pickpocket hedge lifter sometimes however a history will relate justice with tardy step overtakes probus that with punishment so dreadful that be left incapable of further wickedness said 'when probus want money squeeze merridew then lay information against poor wretch who expected longer rope in order to get at wretch have to encourage to break law so see if have to make payment to probus must manufacture criminal a said there can not be many thing worse than making of criminal for satisfaction of money lender ' hardly understood at time full villainy of system in fact be wholly absorbed in own particular case what be going to be done about midnight bade kindest of woman farewell bemember will ' said 'trust nothing to chance take boat down river before daybreak there be sure to be holyhead coach somewhere in morning in

late a hour go in london there be still people in street what have happened be a soon a probus learned truth about gaming table fatal thing be to disclose knowledge understood two thing first that money be irrevocably gone second that if revealed truth to alderman in suburban retreat must need investigate position of thing in case bankruptcy must be precipitated after whether died signed agreement refused to sign must matter nothing to whereas on other hand if signature must be obtained before bankruptcy then money must be raised upon succession if be to die then whole of money must be paid on day of death to matthew be done must therefore be done a soon a possible therefore resolved that plot must be carried into execution on very monday evening caused cottage to be watched by one of girl who frequented black jack followed way from lambeth to soho square carried intelligence where to find to tavern where probus with bishop captain be now waiting understood be playing at concert therefore sallied out about time when concert must be finishing waited for in square at eleven o'clock sallied forth walked down dean street ran down greek street to meet at other end where there be fewer people afterwards changed mind got over field into green street behind mew where resolved to wait for bishop posted on one side captain on other mr probus mr merridew waited little

raised cudgel again verily believe intended to murder a well a to rob victim therefore ran to rescue with blow of stick felled ruffian ' constable looked doubtfully at mr merridew whom knew by sight a everybody connected with criminal part of law certainly did knew a sheriff officer nominally thief taker by secret profession thief maker a matter of notoriety at court from looked at mr probus more doubtfully because knew nothing about except that be attorney mean to such people a constable devil incarnate also looked doubtfully at captain whose face perhaps knew considering that captain have be living for eight year at least in about st giles robbing about road run out of london perhaps constable did know by sight 'well said ' suppose sir john will look into to morrow a for gentleman who say be remember ' here mr probus slipped something into hand 'it be not for ' worthy constable added 'to remember anything besides may be wrong well gentleman will all attend to morrow morning at bow

worst happens may then bribe magistrate understand however that have be changed that there be now no justice who take bribe now if watchman brings few case to constable poor rogue may lose place if constable pocket bribe brings magistrate none may lose place so that be mutually agreed between three that be to have share mankind be for ever seeking praying for justice behold be have got in

finished done with fellow went off to newgate a dumb a ox to shamble poor devil have money friend must need swing whole job be a clean creditable piece of work a have ever be turned out must be hanging nobody must get off then fell to wondering a well what mr probus have done for what must get by whether speculation pleased most have not put into mr merridew power in case might have holy joy of seeing attorney when rope be out sitting in cart congratulated other on own share in job ten guinea apiece down promise of more when man be out of way with long extension of time ' condense jenny narrative be long alter language be wandering 'when doll told ' concluded ' have longer doubt that man whom have succeeded in placing in newgate be none other than poor will so took coach drove here ' then told exactly how everything have happened ' hope ' said 'that matthew if be in conspiracy doe not know what have be done besides chief gainer will be probus not matthew remember will be just race if can compass death before matthew becomes bankrupt then will get back money money think of if not will lose whole well will think nobody know except be mistaken will see will see ' so fell to considering again 'if there be loophole of escape ' went on 'he will wriggle out let think what do know ' only know through ramage ' replied that enough to prove conspiracy know what two men be who be

son of highwayman tyburn bird to third fourth generation know nothing about generation jenny interrupted 'all know be that be going to be saved why man consider probus know nothing about conspirator know nothing about madame vallance none of have least suspicion must not have that know jenny of black jack now will try to get case a to conspiracy clear without attacking loyalty of gang to other have thought of such plan know attorney have seen be tolerably honest will advise will send here be of good cheer will go to fetch alice put on smiling countenance to greet come be man lift drooping spirit of woman who love keep up heart if not own came back at about five day be already over yard court of prison be already dark cell be lit with pair of candle when jenny brought alice brother tom to see alice poor child fell into arm so lay for long time unable to speak for sob that tore almost in piece yet unwilling to let see weakness tom good fellow assumed same air of cheerfulness have learned to show in king bench sniffed air approvingly looked round with pretended satisfaction said 'this place hath be misrepresented room be convenient if small furniture solid air be not so close a one might expect for brief residence temporary residence man might might say cleared throat tear came into eye sank into chair will will ' cried breaking down unable to pretend longer then one spoke indeed heart be full 'it be not so much on account will ' said jenny observed that wore domino indeed never came to prison after first visit without domino precaution by mean unusual because lady might not like to be seen in newgate in case might arouse suspicion if jenny be recognised ' say be not on account so much a for sake of dear creature madam alice implore take courage have proof of conspiracy in hand be black hellish plot only difficulty be a to best mean of using knowledge here confess for moment be not certain ' alice recovered stood up holding hand ' can not believe ' said 'that such wickedness a will be permitted to succeed must bring shame sorrow on child grandchild to third fourth generation 'you talk about generation said jenny part think of be alive not who be to come well so far have not succeeded for conspirator be known to be will cousin know not stayed talking till nine o'clock when visitor have to leave prison jenny cheered heart must hear of difficulty be clear be easy have conspirator in power to morrow must return with honest clever attorney so alice went away with lighter heart be left for night alone in cell with gleam of hope in morning gleam left day broke upon place of gloom brought with only misery despair in forenoon jenny returned with attorney be man who have already acted for name be dewberry be possessed of manner easy assured inspired confidence in face figure be attractive betrayed eagerness to posse of client money observed also at outset that like rest be servant who must if must become lover of jenny mr halliday said ' have heard part of story from madame vallance want next to hear own version ' so told while listened gravely making note 'it be certainly ' said ' very strong point that death must give probus chance of recovering money cousin must then pay off if wished in full whether must do so be question if bankruptcy arrives find still living creditor must be considered together madame ' turned to jenny 'you who have so fine head for management let hear opinion ' think of nothing else said 'yet can not satisfy have thought that sister doll might warn captain that bishop must be exposed in court what must happen must instantly go off with news to merridew then information against doll mother for receiving stolen good what must happen then know very well mr dewberry must have to buy release by forbidding exposure why be most notorious receiver living suppose doll plainly told that sister jenny knew whole case know at present at least think not where be can easily find out that knew whole case meant to expose must happen next murder master must be found on bed with throat cut letter to show that be done by one of maid 'jenny for heaven sake run risk 'not if can help will do know what think of besides be doubt whether matthew must be more rejoiced to see conspiracy succeed put out of way to witness conviction of probus for conspiracy ' beoftly softly madam ' said attorney 'we be long way yet from trial even of mr probus ' said 'your word bring confidence ' feel confidence that there be in newgate will not be enough will for confidence that ought to have must work in silence if friend only knew what be talking here why then lord help landlady of black jack two daughter jenny doll ' must be aware sir ' said mr dewberry 'that be absolutely necessary for to preserve silence upon everything connected with defence must not communicate detail upon subject to most intimate friend relation 'he mean alice ' said jenny 'we must have secrecy ' 'you may trust man whose life be at stake ' 'yes now principal witness be pretended divine pretended country gentleman rest in assurance that none of friend will betray must see what can be done if prove that irish divine be common rogue make evidence suspected prove conspiracy fellow might brave out still swear to attempted robbery then a to other worthy may prove that be notorious rogue still may swear stoutly to evidence must prove in addition that two rogue be known to other 'that can be proved by who be in king bench prison with ' 'and must connect with probus merridew ' can prove that a well ' said jenny 'that be if ' paused witness will give evidence madam must not pour cold water on confidence will witness go into box jenny smiled ' believe said 'that can fill court with witness want more than belief want certainty 'there be way ' said jenny 'if must let mr probus understand that sudden unexpected appearance of new set of creditor must force on bankruptcy immediately mr dewberry interposed hastily beadam implore there be necessity at sir lady must actually sacrifice own fortune future prospect in cause ' safety for life everything ' assure dear madam there be need affair want only patience will adjust to throw also upon husband other liability must not help gentleman for reason there be thousand trick subtlety man of mr probus knowledge may employ for postponement of bankruptcy until after trial of friend here know not resource of law in trained hand mean that supposing mr probus to reckon on success of conspiracy in grieve to find brother in profession involved may cause delay to extend until end be accomplished defeated man of law madam have great power groaned point be that unless be much mistaken conspiracy be intended to intimidate not to be carried out mr probus will offer take liberty on condition of yielding in matter of money ' declared will die first ' 'then remains to be seen if will carry thing through ' so went on arguing on side on side line of action be best be dangerous in end a will see jenny took management of case into own hand with result astonished mr dewberry a well a court four hero of conspiracy five week learned must elapse before case must be tried in court be long tedious time to contemplate in advance meantime be kept in ignorance for most part of what be being done afterwards learned that jenny carried on work in secrecy so that not only conspirator might not have least suspicion that even mr dewberry did not know what be doing until placed case complete in hand few day before trial jenny contrived jenny paid for what case cost in money never learned spared nothing neither labour travel money meantime lived on now in hope now in despondency to go outside among fellow prisoner be to increase wretchedness of prison morning alice brought provision for day tom brought violin music so be not without consolation a remember gloomy period remember with thankfulness how be stayed comforted by two woman of whom one be saint other be well heaven forbid must call sinner in whom never found least blemish not at least christian first offered up prayer for day night wrestling in prayer like jacob for open manifestation of innocence alice be filled with sublime faith lord whom worshipped be very near to must destroy enemy must preserve innocent wicked must be cast down put to perpetual shame never have witnessed faith so simple so strong yet to seeming to conspirator have not single witness whom must call in defence that man be poor favoured chance of becoming robber that brother in law also prisoner in rule must be ready to say be incapable of such action must not help what must allege against clear strong evidence that four perjured villain must offer when must stand up swear away life courage ' said alice 'help cometh from lord will have mercy upon child oh will will will have mercy upon father of child mr dewberry came often have little to tell jenny have gone away jenny have not told what be doing beir ' said 'but for confidence have in incomparable woman in assurance must feel anxious for a yet be within fortnight of trial have not single witness who can prove real character of pretended divine pretended country gentleman since madam assures ' produced snuff box offered 'why then sir in case believe in success of defence ' chapter x same offer thus passed that weary anxious imprisonment way of getting through day be always same soon after daylight went out walked in yard for hour early morning indeed be only time of day when man of decent manner must venture abroad even on state side at time visitor have not yet begun to arrive men be still sleeping off carouse of evening before only few wretch to whom dismal foreboding of future guilty conscience aching heart must not allow sleep crept dolefully about empty yard restlessly sitting standing if spoke to other be with distracted word showing that knew not what said ala drunken orgy of others caused at least relief from terrible suffering of remorse looking forward be not often that one can find excuse for drunkenness after melancholy walk returned to cell where played for hour two afterwards reading meditating always thought turned to impending trial represented called upon to make own defence read aloud failed to impress jury judge summed up jury retired cold bead stood upon forehead trembled verdict be guilty judge assumed black cap verily suffered day despite assurance of jenny mr dewberry torture of one convicted condemned to death if heart be examined after death sure be that black cap must be found engraven upon to show agony endured about one o'clock alice arrived sometimes with tom sometimes alone a for tom have quickly rallied have now completely accepted assurance that acquittal be certain confidence must have be wonderful for consideration that be not own neck be in danger that of brother in law child be not allowed to be brought into prison for fear of fever always lurks about ward cell corridor in afternoon while be talking jenny herself when be not on mysterious journey came wearing domino about four o'clock tom departed little after alice then be left alone to sleep reflection for twelve hour be daily routine on sunday there be service in chapel made horrid by condemned prisoner in pew sitting round empty coffin by ribaldry blasphemous jest of prisoner not even in chapel must refrain one afternoon there be surprise be sitting in conversation together alice jenny with brother in law tom when received visit from le person than mr probus that prince of villain have audacity to call in person upon stood in doorway long lean body bent wearing smile have evidently be borrowed for occasion sprang to foot with indignation arm be gently touched jenny sat beside little behind 'hush ' whispered 'let say what have to say sit down answer by single word ' mr probus looked disconcerted to see resume chair make a if saw heard 'you did not expect mr halliday to see here ' made reply be astonished confess to find here after have passed respect for memory of late employer client sir peter halliday must be excuse only excuse respect if may be permitted to add compassion compassion madam ' bowed to alice 'compassion sir be christian virtue said with such emphasis on adjective a to imply astonishment at finding quality in mr probus 'assuredly madam assuredly be reason why cultivate sometimes to own loss own loss beir alice went on 'you can not be aware that presence here be distasteful will be so good a to tell have to say ' 'certainly madam think have seen before be mr william halliday wife gentleman have not seen before 'he be brother ' 'your brother lady who prefers to wear domino ' for jenny have made haste to replace that disguise 'no doubt be proper in newgate be necessary among friend 'this lady be cousin ' said alice behe will please a to what wear ' 'your cousin be therefore a one may say family party defendant wife brother in law cousin be very good be what must have desired above thing have prayed upon way hither family party ' ber probus ' said alice 'if discourse be to continue beware how speak of prayer never have seen face so set so full of righteous wrath with so much repression man quaked under eye come to business ' said ' fear there be spirit of suspicion even of hostility abroad let that pas hope indeed to remove now if please give attention ' be now lawyer alert watchful 'your trial mr halliday take place in short time few day know what defence will attempt hope may be successful have thought upon subject confess well can only say that know what kind of defence will be possible in case so clear so well attested ' jenny laid hand again on arm 'hush ' whispered restrained still sat in silence 'let point out to in moment will understand why how stand know of course be always well to be clear in one mind principal evidence be that given by two gentleman from country young squire of cumberland be westmoreland clergyman of sister kingdom have naturally be in frequent communication with two gentleman find that be kept in london to detriment of own affair that must willingly get business despatched quickly so that must be free to go home again that bear malice none one because be clergyman therefore practises forgiveness a christian duty other because be gentleman who scorn revenge besides be not attacked attacking party so far say noble hearted gentleman from desiring to hang poor wretch must willingly suffer to go at large be disposition of mind promise great deal have never found more happy disposition in witness before resentment no revenge desire for fatal termination to trial be wonderful rare so came over to tell what say to entreat to make use of friendly temper while last might say will might be induced to withdraw altogether from trial in case prosecution must fall to ground for case depends wholly upon evidence for a know arrived by accident upon scene be too late to see anything mr merridew tell that what saw might have be fight rather than robbery ought not to have revealed weak point in evidence be for mercy for mercy so say that if evidence be not forthcoming prosecution must fall through then dear sir liberty must be once more happy lot stopped folded arm have not offered chair partly because be mr probus must not suffer to sit in presence partly because there be chair to offer 'these gentleman sir ' said tom 'be willing understand to retire from case ' must not say willing must rather say not unwilling ' 'do ' tom asked 'demand money a bribe a price for retiring ' 'no sir gentleman be far above such consideration believe must be simply contented with sum of money a must meet personal expense loss by prolonged stay 'and to how much may loss expense taken together amount ' hear that reverence have lost valuable lectureship have be given to in absence that squire have sustained loss among cattle horse also owing to absence ' 'and combined figure sir must cover loss ' can not say positively probably clergyman loss must be represented by l squire by l there must be own cost in case a well be a usual trifle suppose be to pay money ' tom continued 'what must have to prove that must not give evidence ' there touch on tenderest point pundonor a spaniard say must lodge money with person in whom must agree a person of honour after case for prosecution have broken down not before must give that money observe that on part of two simple gentleman there be trust even in attorney in myself ' said nothing for a man knew must not find tenth part of sum knew there be something behind what be guessed very well in fact mr probus immediately showed what be ber halliday ' said ' believe that know circumstance have on one two occasion have to make acquainted with will not give offence if suppose that can not immediately raise sum of l even to save life ' spoke to looked at alice 'he can not certainly ' said alice 'either immediately in time proposed 'quite so now be case of life death life death sir life death madam honourable life long life for husband shameful death shameful death shameful to shameful to shameful to child child 'hush ' whispered jenny laying repressive hand again upon shoulder for again be boiling over with indignation what author contriver of shameful death be to come call attention to disgrace of be sole cause have be left to myself without alice jenny must have brained old villain obeyed sat in silence answering nothing 'consider madam ' continued to address alice 'this be not time for false pride for obstinacy even for standing out for better term once more make same offer made before let sell chance of certain succession of know let do difficulty trouble will vanish like smoke of bonfire tell plainly madam that can control appearance of evidence without prosecution can hing will control if agrees to sell husband will walk out on day of trial free man drew out of pocket pocket book from that document remembered well deed of sale transfer nobody replied alice looked at anxiously remained silent dogged 'two year ago somewhere about time made same proposal

be gentle be strong face be sweet be firm man saw listened misunderstood know mind of husband in matter for reason understand will not speak to money be devised by father to survivor of two cousin have always be accepted by a proof at end father desired to understand that be not wholly unforgiven that there be loophole of forgiveness did not explain what be must husband who have desire to see death of cousin survive mr matthew will receive fortune a proof that life of hard honest work have be accepted by father in full forgiveness sir husband considers father wish a sacred nothing pressure

miserable neck twisted like chicken last thought will be that threw life away that by dying give cousin ' so flung out of room left looking blankly at other then jenny spoke did well will to preserve silence in presence of wretch do well to preserve silence about defence dear people have counted up cost will be more than at first thought because case must be made complete so complete that there can be doubt promise ' took off domino face be very pale remember now that there be on unaccustomed look of nobility such a belongs to one who take resolution certain to involve in great trouble at expense of self sacrifice martyrdom ' promise ' said 'that cost what may case will be complete chapter xi impending trial time awful time day of fate drew nearer despite assurance of jenny of attorney there be moment when anticipation doubt caused agony unspeakable sometimes have thought that agony be cowardly must be ashamed of one know who have not suffered in same way torture of feeling one self

watchful attorney lest anything must happen to hinder development of case a intended hoped among other thing called upon mr probus nominally on account of matter ' believe said 'that be attorney of mr matthew halliday have that honour ' 'yes observed fact in reading affidavit of yours in connection with case in be engaged for defence case of mr william halliday now in newgate on charge of highway robbery ' 'defence have then defence ' ' defence certainly have defence counsel have engaged mr caterham k c mr stanton of whom probably know a counsel for defence dear sir have very good defence indeed let see arrived on spot observe after alleged attack be committed ' 'certainly affidavit evidence before sir john be only a to identity of robber 'quite so need not concern here with defence of mr william halliday come to speak about affair of mr matthew ' sir what about affair ' hear that be in very bad way oh sir indeed wish to ask question only repeat what hear in city be there freely stated that firm be ruined that ship be sold that business be gone ' 'they be injurious false report 'it be possible hope so meantime however have come to communicate to matter perhaps know be important that must know person chiefly concerned give permission to speak of perhaps do know already perhaps client have not concealed from do for instance know that mr matthew halliday be married man mr probus started ' cried bearried certainly not 'it be evident that know client private history have be married two year more doe not however cohabit with wife be separated by consent ' married 'they be separated say such separation however doe not release husband from liability of wife debt wife have mr matthew contracted debt looked very uneasy wife be client of mine have contracted very large debt may possibly make arrangement with creditor may not in latter case will send to client who will hand over to will demand payment without delay failing payment will take step that law permit also without delay be why thought best to communicate fact to client authorized to do so mr probus made answer must not understand what meant 'if be interest to postpone bankruptcy mr probus may be wiser for reason other to force on only came to tell of danger threatens client not of course client whose wife be mine ' mr probus made at first reply be thinking what might mean be of course too wary not to perceive that threat of forcing on bankruptcy be part of defence though in indirect manner 'have ' asked presently 'any knowledge of amount of debt believe amount to over l ' mr probus groaned aloud ' thought must prepare mind for blow may happen day let see trial take place next wednesday next wednesday dare say creditor will wait till after event good morning mr probus ' be going away when mr probus called back be aware sir made prisoner handsome offer ' have be told that made certain offer offered very large sum of l if must sell succession if consent principal witness in case will not appear ' ber probus a case stand now must not take l for price of chance ' again be going away again mr probus called back 'we be speaking ' said 'of defence of unhappy young man mr william halliday of course be concerned in matter only a accidental bystander of course old friend of family there be to be defence say ' 'assuredly ' have always understood that young man be quite poor that wife friend be also quite poor 'that be true man may be quite poor yet may have friend who will fight point rather than see man condemned to death on false charge ' 'quite false assure ' beir surprise to be sure did not see assault yet evidence be most clear two gentleman unknown to other unknown to who witnessed affair how can such evidence a be got over ' mr probus be not for to say how will be got over be believe giving evidence on what may be called minor point will therefore be in court on occasion of trial can say nothing of course must advise person engaged in case to abstain from appearing if possible be assured that thing quite unexpected will take place meantime to return to point for came here advise client to prepare to meet claim rising out of wife debt to sum of many thousand many thousand did say ' 'forty thousand believe 'good heaven sir what can woman be doing to get through such enormous sum 'indeed can not inform be age in woman call equal of men client mr probus have got through great deal more than in same time including believe l lent can not repay ' do know about affair sir ' 'nothing nothing will see in court on day of trial mr probus ' went away leaving a intended brother in law in anxious condition having said nothing must lead to suspect that conspiracy be entirely discovered must be laid open in court then came last day before trial in afternoon friend be gathered together in cell attorney have read for last time statement of defence looked through once more ' believe said 'that case will get so far whatever happens mr halliday will do well to remember that have to thank madame here believe will be possible for to thank enough until find out for sacrifice have made for risk be running on behalf can hope madame that sacrifice may be made up to that risk may prove illusory ' smiled be wan smile 'whatever result said 'believe sir will never regret sacrifice if call such risk if by can defeat most abominable conspiracy ' ' be in hope said attorney mr probus might be terrified so might withdraw at last moment be easy to withdraw have only to order two principal witness not to attend when case fall to ground a be now free from anxiety sighed 'well from very natural anxiety belongs to prison to uncertainty of law be better for that must put in witness when can establish charge of conspiracy marvel indeed greatly that man so astute must not perceive that defence where king counsel junior of great repute be engaged must mean serious case that serious case only mean denial of main charge else

associate have used knowledge to secure arrest have induced mother sister at least one of rogue of black jack to join in giving evidence against conspirator so that when news be spread abroad that house a well a black jack have be wrecked content destroyed there be at first strong feeling among many that be kind of wild justice deserved because ought not to have turned against friend a for man for whose sake did may be sure that motive commonly attributed to be such a must naturally commend to majority that woman must be so deeply moved by generosity of heart by love of justice by honest indignation against so foul conspiracy a to resolve at risk hazard to defeat object of villain to prevent destruction of innocent man required too high flight to make possible to be considered by

lord brockenhurst mr dewberry attorney not to speak of governor of prison who came daily to ask after fair prisoner health lordship let know day by day concerning effort being made on jenny behalf reason why be so slow be partly due to feeling on part of judge though motive of prisoner might be good have confessed to heinous crime law must not be made ridiculous therefore few week of prison must be allowed be done afterwards in vindication of majesty of law 'but ' said lord brockenhurst 'he be at least on side so much know for fact be great thing to have judge on side ' also told that counsel for prosecution gentleman of great eminence in law be also very active on behalf that juryman have drawn up petition signed unanimously for jenny pardon release that queen be also reported to be interested in case in favour of clemency whole circumstance being so unusual behaviour of prisoner so strangely actuated by filial affection even towards unworthy object that general opinion of people be that be impossible to suppose that woman in jenny position commanding receipt of thousand night of masquerade must condescend to so low miserable business a receiving bundle of stolen good not worth couple of guinea altogether with assistance of wretched confederate whose evidence might hang further that mind of people being made up thought more about matter in word that be going well
