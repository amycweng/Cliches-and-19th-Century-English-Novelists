solicitor only person who be able to speak on subject understood man faculty be perfectly sound intellect a clear a ever moreover there be sign upon of hallucination melancholia mental trouble if maintained silence face betrayed perturbation day after day presented to morning sun calm cloudless face if smiled not neither did sigh now most remarkable thing be that eccentricity might have be explained on theory of great age loss of friend contemporary have be practised for nearly seventy year a young man young man began life have continued ever since reason great grandson have always understood be shock caused by sudden death of wife further than knew did inquire if one grows up in presence of certain strange line of conduct becomes accepted without inquiry old man have become solitary when young man grandfather be boy grandfather father have always have before knowledge if not sight of eccentricity there be curiosity in mind at about possible cause seventy year be whole life of average man strange creature have spent whole time alone in silence in solitude without occupation be not whole span of man own life for be now completing ninety fourth year from distant church tower came presently striking of quarter followed by stroke of one at moment old woman came out passed in front of visitor in doorway stood watching to catch eye of master said nothing waited there until noticed presence perhaps be expecting stopped old woman retired master entered house taking notice of young man a passed eye looked through with gleam of recognition even of intelligence a to presence yet young man only one of descendant paid visit once month so to see if be still in health walked straight into room be single sitting room dining room living room have be library large

bibliophile book be bound in gilt of title have mostly disappeared if took volume from shelf found that have parted from binding if not took advantage of movement to remove from binding if examined shelf long enough must have found that there be not one book in whole library of date later than of thousand upon thousand of book published in seventy year since time not one be in library for instance quarterly edinburgh review stood here bound stopped at annual register be here also bound stopped at on great library table there be lying a if for daily use scattered volume magazine have be placed there for reading of house in one have touched table since time in year long low leather chair stood beside fire leather be in rag tatter worn to shred at table be placed splendid great wooden chair looked like chair of hall porter carpet be in rag tatter except part along front of shelf there be whole colour be faded in front of fire be placed common thick sheepskin young man followed ancestor into library took chair placed by fire sat down long leg curled watching waiting have be in same place before silence of old man meaningless look in eye terrified on first occasion be then unaccustomed to manner of man have gradually grown accustomed to sight no longer terrified now sat in place on other side of fire resolved upon making sure that old man be properly cared for properly fed properly clad properly looked after in respect that health be good that there be need of seeking advice sat down therefore by fire looked on while old man took dinner visitor have said be great grandson of recluse be also heir of house future owner of place possession a for what be by calling will hear presently being heir presumptive assumed duty of making occasional visit be received a have be stated in silence with not slightest show of recognition without heeding presence then old man took seat at table lifted cover began dinner consisted day of same dish perhaps there be not many men at ninety four who can devour day full sized steak with potato bread can drink with whole bottle of port yet be what recluse did descendant for part made business that port must be of best that steak must be treated scientifically in order to ensure tenderness juiciness recluse took food fast eagerly one must perceive that in earlier day must have enjoyed great noble power of putting away beef took steak with fierceness devoured immense quantity of bread drank wine off in goblet a in old day have tossed off great glass of beer did not sip generous wine did roll about in glass hold up to light drank a child drink water unconsciously yet eagerly regardless of taste careless of quality when bottle be empty there be nothing more to eat left wooden chair cast great length into long easy chair where stretched out leg towards fire leaning head upon hand elbow on arm of chair gazed into fire with eye have in kind of expression evidently thought spectator old man have two sens left like strong meat drink like physical comfort that provide like warmth of fire then rose slowly stood with back to fire looking down upon ancestor began remonstrance repeated with variation on visit sir said come to see from time to time a know come to make sure that be cared for that be well come to see if anything can be done for on occasion never fail to pretend that see make believe that be not present do see know be here know who be know why be here very well be suppose humour to affect silence solitude nothing can say will fear induce to break silence there be sign of recognition reply change of movement why have imposed upon lifelong misery know will inquire perhaps will never know seems to great mistake cause sudden bereavement have always understood if be in consequence of person fault person misfortune waste wreck of own life must not remove cause if be fault of own such wreck waste of life must only be aggravation of offence if be bereavement surely must be manlier part to bear to go on with duty of life however a know circumstance have right to speak on point be too late went on to make up for year have thrown away be too late for change can not even now at late hour go back among fellow creature become human again if be only for year two must say be harder to continue life of loneliness misery than to go back to life for be born there be answer have be over house morning young man went on pitilessly have allowed to fall into shameful condition damp have got into picture wall paper will need many thousand to restore place to condition proper to gentleman house dont think ought to spend money live in a gentleman of position ought to do there be still answer then heir expected none old man lifted head from hand dropped back on chair eye closed hand dropped

kind endeavoured to make own to speak upon with manner of specialist be heard with deference reported at length more than be not permitted to six twenty subject be such a demand clear head untiring industry grasp of figure power of making attractive also required prodigious memory valuable quality young man possessed at cambridge where went out in mathematics tore reluctantly away from examiner who gave must with tear that must be no more than part ii division class wept that must not a good examiner hope to do before long carry examination on to part iii divided into three part part into three class then to part iv also divided into three division division into three class so to go on examining candidate always decreasing in number once year for rest of natural life ending with

prematurely at early age of thirty two father who in turn distinguished at university also in turn entered house be also in turn considered young man of promise when too be carried off at about same age there be moment when leonard asked whether untoward fate be to be a well there be indeed special reason for asking question of a yet knew nothing meantime asked question of future did concern about decree of fate study be pleasantly furnished with two three easy chair student wooden chair book lined wall two three cup stood on mantelshelf showing that tenant of room be pale student consumer of midnight oil above there be drawing of country house same house have already seen one observed also with pleasure further proof that occupant have hour of relaxation tobacco that vulgar

of belief be invaluable presently sat down again renewed thread of investigation after hour so threw aside pen have accomplished what have proposed to do morning if man be going to succeed will generally find that know what mean to do time that will take over that set to work with directness a well a resolution task be finished then before twelve oclock leonard pushed back chair sprang to

magazine accepting proposal to contribute paper on certain economic theory leonard smiled with satisfaction nineteenth century be ladder of ambition be by mean of magazine of one two like unto that ambitious young man be enabled to put forward a student if not yet authority on subject more rapid way of advance than by mean of house leonard have already written on subject with success a student be now to write upon with authority will understand from leonard be young man whose mind be fully occupied even absorbed with work be at once greatest delight ladder for ambition that occupied good position in society that work thought relaxation be of one who lived moved habitually on high level free from meanness sordid care anxiety of kind on same staircase same floor be flat exactly corresponding in particular to own except that window looked out towards opposite pole flat into will not penetrate be occupied by young lady who lived in just a leonard lived in with man wife to look after people may be neighbour in mansion yet not know other be not likely that leonard must have made acquaintance of miss constance ambry for fortunate circumstance that belonged to same club a well a same collection of flat that be introduced to at club that met at dinner day after day that speedily discovered fact that be neighbour that became friend that often dined together at club that frequently walked home together will be understood therefore that miss constance ambry must have be called few year ago emancipated young woman word have already become belated in year two will be obsolete emancipation have ceased to carry reproach to excite astonishment many girl unmarried woman live alone in flat mansion similar place have latch key marvel that there must have be formerly time when latch key be withheld from girl go where like see what wish to see meet people wish to meet emancipated woman twenty year ago thought necessary in order to prove superiority of intellect to become at least atheist be part of situation other prancings curvettings there be now have settled down question of comparative intellect being no longer discussed go on in many respect almost a if be still in ancient house of bondage in case there be strong reason comfortably running into good many hundred year why constance ambry must dare to go own way live at own will began independent career by three year at girton during studentship distinguished especially by writing critical essay in be remarked that passion of love a depicted dwelt upon by poet be entirely ignored by critic not so much friend explained from maidenly reserve a from complete inability to sympathize even with woman point of view indeed woman who write poetry love song have always done utmost to conceal mendaciously to represent in same term under same form a masculine passion on leaving girton accepted post a lecturer on english literature in woman college be poorly paid office hitherto have be difficult to find good lecturer to keep constance must afford not only to take also to make sole object of work thought one be pleased to add that idea of liberty of woman included liberty to dress a well a can afford presented to admiring envious class constant spectacle of woman dressed a must be not splendidly beautifully girl regarded lecturer clad like summer garden in varied beauty with far greater awe than have entertained for predecessor who be dumpy wore hair short appeared habitually in man jacket two be friend close fast leonard be not afraid of compromising by taking tea in drawing room be constance afraid of compromising by venturing alone into opposite flat if wanted to talk about anything be dangerous position even for young man whose ambition absorb thought who have put question of marriage into background to be taken up at convenient moment not yet arrived be dangerous also for girl even when be emancipated a regard young man usual consequence happened first perceived that gave peculiar pleasure to sit beside at dinner to walk home with then became disappointed if did not meet presently found thinking great deal about also detected in act of confiding ambition to sympathetic ear be one of worst symptom possible have now arrived at stage when image of girl be always present in young man mind when sometimes interferes with work when explanation becomes absolutely necessary if there be to be peace quiet work victorian lover no longer speaks writes about flame dart be still possessed held by dominant presence in mind night day of mistress in matter there come time one moment when word have to be spoken a with pear have hour of perfect ripeness so in love there be day hour moment when word mean so much must be spoken be most unfortunate thing if lover chooses wrong moment be also very unfortunate if ripeness be on one side only leonard campaigne made mistake being self contained young man thought about great deal more than thought of other people be not necessarily sign of selfishness of obtuseness not at be defect with men of strong nature ambitious aim to think habitually about aim therefore while be quite ripe for declaration did not ask whether ripeness be also arrived at by other person concerned unfortunately be not other person concerned be still in critical stage must consider friend from outside felt a yet attraction towards uncritical condition absorption of love leonard did not suspect arrest so to speak of development assumed that maiden heart have advanced pari passu with wrote letter therefore method of wooing be le embarrassing than of speech believe that girl prefer latter certainly be difficult to be glowing in letter if there must be doubt be letter so persuasive a voice aided by pressure of hand ardour of eye dear friend be about to imperil situation preservation of be greatest happiness have allowed to talk to freely about cherished ambition have even done honour of consulting about own must not throw away position of confidence for consideration let however venture to put before simple question ask to consider possibility of change in situation change there be only one can consider must not in way affect confidence must draw more closely how must affect will tell if allow friend l c not loverlike letter at be yet there be possibility about see held out hope that more must be told young lady answered by asking few day for consideration be to send bring reply that morning constance knocked at door came in from room without hat took chair leonard own wooden chair sat down beginning to talk about other thing a if such matter a proposal of marriage be of importance be only way be always feminine be told last night said at club fancy at club have be compromising by dining night after night with letting walk home with be idea of woman liberty be not to form friendship dont abuse member pray remember leonard that in least mind what say at first glance at face one must understand that girl be not in least alarmed a to what woman might say of be proud face there be many kind of pride might have be proud of family have chosen that form of intellect attainment of beauty be remarkable be not proud in such way have that intense self respect be pride of highest kind be woman therefore to be wooed wooer must meet equal intense self respect pride made seem cold everybody thought intensely cold leonard be perhaps only man who knew by thousand little indication that be very far from cold pose of head line of mouth intellectual look in eye clear cut regularity of feature proclaimed pride seemed to proclaim coldness always remember what say constance now tell what came to say rose from chair remained standing began by looking at thing over mantel a if be greatly interested in tobacco cigarette then turned upon abruptly joining hand what came to say be read answer in face be frank hard without least sign of embarrassment confusion weakening be not with such look that girl give to lover however pretended not to understand what be well be just have thought about for whole week wont do be answer do for of like very much like present relation dine together at club come in here without fuss come to place without fuss talk walk go about together suppose that will ever receive kind of invitation from man whom regard so much yet yet why obstructive participle bring spoke with coldness due to discouragement in maiden face fullest worship of shook head put up hand oh said worship want worship what do mean by worship mean greatest respect greatest reverence greatest admiration for what for constance ambry thank friend of respect accept with gratitude not of still dare say at moment mean consider little do worship intellect confess now know that be distinctly inferior to own know say if came to pretending to worship intellect inferior to own must lose respect for must lose faith in truthfulness can not be intellect be then worship of genius have genius that know very well be worship of attainment be far below most of scholar of university fellow of college can not possibly pretend to worship attainment let worship constance ambry laughed lightly must be very foolish of to do so for must not do so without lowering standard character by pretending what be not case for be higher than in of virtue possible to not bit higher believe that standard of everything truth honour courage patience everything be like intellect distinctly lower than own such be respect entertain for therefore friend pray think of offering worship wrong constance nature be far higher than mine laughed again if be to marry in week must find out mistake then might fall into opposite mistake how be to make understand do understand there be something attracts men be so suppose be face voice figure manner one can tell why man be attracted constance be possible that be not conscious of beauty looked full in face replied slowly wish understood thing see very well that men be more easily moved to love than woman make most appalling mistake know of mistake not to be remedied let two make mistake must be mistake believe dont know there be question of beauty woman be not fascinated by beauty of other woman man be attracted by face straightway attribute to soul behind face virtue possible woman can behold pretty face without believing that be stamp of purity holiness besides face why in dozen year what will be like in thirty year oh terrible to think of never constance must never be otherwise than wholly beautiful shook head again unconvinced wish to be worshipped repeated other woman may like to must be humiliation dont want worship want rivalry let work among who truly work win own place a for own face so called feminine attraction confess that be not interested in not in least if will only let go on admiring oh shook that admirable head impatiently a much a please leonard sighed persuasion knew well be of use with young lady knew own mind will ask more said heart be capable of emotion except one be deficient in one passion if have must make divine laughed scornfully make divine repeated oh talk like man not scholar philosopher mere man left personal side of question began to treat generally whole of poetry be disfigured with sham divinity counterfeit divinity of woman want that kind of ascribed divinity

judicially in imagination have assumed wig gown opinion repeated must be at first on statement of case that be unfit have be unfit for last seventy year to make will be undoubtedly on point so eccentric a to appear of unsound mind doe nothing allows house garden furniture picture to fall into decay never speaks have occupation point say to mind unhinged by shock of seventy year ago shock of only heard other day yes know sister in law mother grandfather thought to screen from what thought family misfortune by never telling truth be to say whole truth have followed same rule with child family misfortune hardly know even now what to understand by well be superstitious father died young grandfather died young like be young men of promise great grandfather at age of six twenty thereabouts be afflicted a know think think that be visiting of unknown sin of father upon child think that old man father must have done something terrible oh be absurd very likely very likely meantime a to power of making will must remember that during year old man have never done anything foolish have seen solicitor tell that from father to son having acted for year have found perfectly clear headed about money matter must not ask what have done with money what intends to do with there be fact evidence of solicitor a to clearness of intellect opinion therefore be that will do something astonishing unexpected disgusting with money that will be very difficult if not impossible to set aside will oh be opinion be reason why ask be have just discovered family of hitherto unknown cousin do know name of galley be not name must say of highest nobility possibly not be name of cousin however one of be solicitor of somewhat low class must say man have pretension to be called gentleman practises life in commercial road be suppose quite out of ordinary quarter where must find solicitor of standing quite quite a place of residence deplorable from point of view have sister appears who be board school teacher board school teacher be at least respectable who be precious cousin of ours be grandchild of aunt of yours lucy by name lucy yes have heard of thought be dead long ago married man named galley seem to have gone down in world more family misfortune lawyer shuddered be not superstitious said really more misfortune oh misfortune nonsense there be always

condition to make will that be left of personal property will be divided in two equal share one moiety among father heir on side while other will go to old lady grandmother on other side be be afraid quite true there may have be will before fell into eccentricity be great pity leonard that people have turned up great misfortune because may have to share with still there must be enormous accumulation mother did not tell anything about possible cousin yet do exist be very serious important possibility people will probably interfere with to very serious extent now fred have turned up will want share too misfortune how came grandfather to die so young leonard passed on to point fell into fever be only two year old at time leonard said nothing about suicide clearly not only uncle also have be kept in dark about true cause of unexpected demise departed closing door softly so a not to shake up confuse delicate tissue of brain always occupied in arriving at opinion a soon a be gone barrister drew out paper once more resumed speech for have prepared dozen most excellent story in such case british public doe not ask for story to be new leonard rejoined company upstairs uncle fred walked part of way home with hadnt expected said to find old man still living of course can not go on much longer have thought about what may happen when end come not much confess one must take that doe not spend fiftieth part of income have heard a boy that estate be worth year very likely unless there have be depression say spends year leaf year take for expense repair leaf year have be going on like for seventy year total accumulation at compound interest for year must reach two million so who be to have descendant suppose brother christopher two million to divide between very pretty fortune very pretty indeed good night boy good night walked away cheerfully with elastic step accumulation accumulation said leonard looking after be for accumulation will too begin to

keeping child from knowledge of trouble yes remember went on talking told whole of family history narrated misfortune at length to leonard listening in little back room with gathering twilight red fire to soft sad voice of mournful lady there came again vision of two woman in widow weed in cottage among flower tree fuchsia climbing rose myrtle passion flower through childhood sat together

for chance of accumulation did mention whispered thought wouldnt cant get to feel properly about matter woman have got imagination none well man like cant make will cant thats comfort good evening mr campaigne rely entirely upon to maintain interest of family if necessary against madman will accumulation ah he ninety five be ninety six call selfish to live so long unless man pauper ought to be thinking of great grandchild chapter viii in land of beech leonard met constance few day later at club dined at same table a for decision rejection be ignored by tacit consent situation remained apparently unaltered in reality everything be changed look thoughtful said presently after twice making observation failed to catch attention be absent minded beg pardon yes be do feel thoughtful must perhaps if found family suddenly enlarged in direction have received unknown cousin from america have received great aunt lesser aunt two second cousin be not from america be on contrary from far east end of town even from ratcliffe shadwell perhaps stepney oh constance heard with astonishment naturally waited for more if more be to follow perhaps however friend might not wish to talk of connection with shadwell great aunt be charming continued lesser aunt be not so charming second cousin be be well man be solicitor who seems to practice chiefly in police court defending who be drunk disorderly with who be pickpocket hooligan common fraud variegated life must say full of surprise unexpectedness be something like family tall with sharp feature more perhaps of vulture than eagle in one may be mistaken sister be like mother short round plump not to disguise truth common looking must say that be capable be board school teacher be saying other day constance that be pity have never be hampered by poor relation consider that be really spoiled child of fortune reminded that have position already made have distinguished university career be getting on in house have family scandal misfortune poor relation anything well loss be now supplied by accession of poor relation other thing mention of thing omitted reminded fortune suppose so hastened to turn on supply of everything be now quite like rest of world do poor relation want money yes not from solicitor think that there must be great sum of money accumulated by patriarch of whom have spoken to cupidity of sort not desire to borrow sent to partly wanted to put in claim informally partly prepared way to make dispute will that old man may have made be poor therefore be grasping suppose believe have poor relation said constance mine however trouble much there have be family enlargement in direction certain uncle of mine who formerly enacted with much credit old tragedy of prodigal son have come back from australia have be living on same diet a prodigal shuck bean pod hardly look a if have be diet be well dressed big important repeat constantly be most anxious for everybody to know that be prosperous doubt somehow leonard paused expression of doubt be not always wise return of middle aged prodigal be interesting unusual fear must not congratulate altogether on unexpected enlargement yet said ought to have poor relation however there be more behind what be said about disgrace well theyve come too oh constance changed colour disgrace leonard be very sorry really never supposed of course not be merest coincidence at same time like coincidence be astonishing just after remark did really make very uncomfortable ive stepped into quite remarkable family history full of surprising event of disaster have already remarkable family history so thought long history creditable history ending with ancient recluse of whom have told be rather proud of old old man singular being who have be recluse for seventy year have always known about one of very earliest thing be told be miraculous existence of eccentric ancestor told so much suppose because be a matter of fact heir to estate whenever happens to fall in be never told suppose because be horrible story why old man became recluse that only learned yesterday from ancient aunt who be only daughter of still more ancient recluse why be be dont let ask about private affair not at there be nothing might not be proclaimed from house top there never be there be private affair if must only think so well seems that one day seventy year ago brother in law of gentleman then hearty young fellow of five six twenty be staying at hall went out after breakfast be presently found murdered in wood in consequence of hearing dreadful thing suddenly sister ancestor wife died on same day ancient aunt be born on day that mother died blow be certainly very terrible affected ancestor with grief so great that became at once what be now melancholy recluse taking no longer least interest in anything be to very strange that young man strong physically mentally must not have shaken off obsession doe seem very strange have ancestor murdered somewhere father of one of grandmother case be different aged aunt told story have theory about great crime having be committed suggests that parent of recluse must have be great unknown unsuspected criminal kind of gilles de retz there have be misfortune scattered about related whole string of calamity think in consequence of crime committed by worthy a mild christian believe a ever followed hound drank bottle of port be thinking of course of visitation upon third fourth generation to of do belong be of fourth according to theory be tempting lends new distinction to family lady be immensely proud of family find consolation for own misfortune in thought that be in part atonement for past wickedness strange be not of course if there be crime there can be consequence have misfortune be very marked yes very marked unmistakable misfortune can not be got over denied explained away misfortune doom what please what doe recluse say about say nothing never speaks constance will ride over with see man place be only five twenty mile so road be dry spring be upon come to morrow there be pretty village old church eighteenth century house falling into ruin great garden run to bramble thistle park besides recluse recluse might not like visit will not notice besides sleep afternoon when be awake see nobody eye go straight through one like rntgen ray believe see bone nothing else least frequented of great highroad running out of london be assuredly that pass through uxbridge so right into heart of shire of buckingham home clearing settlement of beech few bicycle attempt road ordinary cyclist know care nothing for attraction yet there be much to see in one place can visit cottage where milton finished paradise lost be still kept just a when poet lived in there be church two three mile church memorable even historical for most part beautiful almost church in county have famous man associated with on right be burial place of russell with ancient manor house joy solace for eye also on right be ancient manor house on left be quiet peaceful burial place of penn elwood two illustrious member of society of friend also on left may turn aside to see church road house of england patriot john hampden road go up road go down over long low hill through long low valley on side on be wood coppice park with tree scattered about country house shire in england be more studded with country house than of buck at distance of six eight mile there stand town town in buck be small be picturesque have open market place town hall ancient inn old house know of one where there be inn of fourteenth century have have sketched by skilful limner call boar head eastcheap must like to see anybody question authenticity of name if be so daring must add portrait of jack falstaff sitting in great chair by fire on fine clear day in early spring two cyclist rode through country be leonard friend constance went by train a far a uxbridge then took road at first be enough to breathe pure air of spring to fly along quiet road while rook cawed in tree over field lark sang then drew nearer began to talk be what brought out to see asked constance be well content if be what lovely place be what lovely air be fragrant sun brings out fragrance from very field a well a wood be quietest most beautiful of road near london be going to show more not to day must come again will show milton cottage penn burial ground john hampdens church tomb old manor house of chenies latimer to day be only going to show old family house will come when catkin have given place to leaf hedge rose be in blossom when park be worth looking at everything however at place be in condition of decay will see house church village then if like will go on to nearest town get kind of dinner go home by train that plea well went on in silence for while leonard took up parable again about family have be in same place said for immense time have never produced great man distinguished man if consider there be not really enough distinguished men to go round family have twice recently made bid for distinguished man own father grandfather be promising politician be cut off in early manhood what strange thing yes part of what ancient aunt call family luck have have in fact amazing quantity of bad luck listen be like history of house driven scourged by hand of fate listened while went through terrible list why said list of disaster doe really suggest terrible word unto third fourth generation dont wonder at aunt looking about for criminal what must forefather have done to bring about succession of misfortune let get down rest little sat down on stile turned talk into more serious vein what have forefather done nothing of be quite certain have always be most respectable squire good fox hunter with touch of scholarship have done nothing misfortune be pure bad luck nothing else word however do force on one be not superstitious yet since venerable dame however morning argued with said must be such terrible injustice innocent child must suffer from father misdeed that can not be so dont know said constance be not so sure too among superstitious also however be brought up with theory suppose went to church yes went to church now remember that mother for reason have only just learned believed that be expiating sin of forefather be very easy for to go back to language idea of childhood so much so that morning made little search after certain passage have well nigh forgotten what be that be directed against very theory express exactly opposite opinion passage be in prophet ezekiel do remember have never read that prophet have never considered subject be very fine passage ezekiel be one of finest writer possible ought to be read more studied more tell sense of passage can give very word listen stood up took off hat declaimed word with much force what mean ye that ye use proverb concerning land of israel saying father have eaten sour grape childrens teeth be set on edge a live saith lord god ye will not use proverb more behold soul be mine a soul of father so also soul of son be mine soul sinneth will die if man be just will surely live be very noble word constance indeed

brother in law mr algernon campaigne cause of death be certified by dr alden deposed that be caused by single blow from heavy club branch have probably be picked up close by club be lying on table jagged branch thick at one end be red with blood nature of wound showed that be one blow only that by most determined resolute hand have caused death that death must have be instantaneous mr algernon campaigne jp of campaigne park deposed that deceased named langley holme brother in law wife brother most intimate friend be staying with that on tuesday morning two started together after breakfast for walk walked through park crossed road got over stile on other side followed pathway under hill be entering wood in body be found when recollected letter have to be written posted that morning therefore stopped explained that must return immediately unfortunately brother in law chose to continue walk alone mr campaigne turned walked home a quickly a must saw deceased more until be brought back dead coroner asked if have observed anyone in wood said have not looked about carefully that have seen nobody little boy who gave name of tommy dadd said that knew meaning of oath deposed that be on hillside scaring bird day that saw two gentleman get over stile walk along footpath together talking fast loud that came to wood that one of mr campaigne turned back that looked up down path a if be expecting somebody then walked away very fast stop said coroner let understand fact quite plainly saw mr campaigne deceased get over stile walk a far a wood yes saw campaigne turn back walk away yes go on then long time after see john dunning walking from farm across field to pathway be carrying basket of something over shoulder wore smock frock went into wood too presently came out ran back to farm yard three other men came carried something away did nobody else go into wood nobody john dunning said that be labourer on day in question be on way to work have to pas through wood that half way through came upon what thought be man asleep when looked closer found that be gentleman be dead lay in pool of blood there be scuffle of foot sign of struggle that tried to lift getting hand frock covered with blood stain that found bit of rough jagged wood lying beside body be covered with blood at one end on making discovery ran out of wood made way a fast a must to nearest farm where gave alarm got four men to come with carrying shutter blanket coroner cross examined witness severely where did work be native of village have ever be in trouble what be be carrying on shoulder must swear be not club have be found near body to question man gave straightforward answer coroner then asked if have searched pocket of deceased at point deceased valet stood up said that master have not be robbed that watch ring purse be found upon in pocket presume that murderer have time said coroner must have be disturbed never yet heard of murder be not robbery unless indeed there be revenge in mr campaigne interposed must suggest mr coroner said with submission sir said coroner suggestion be instruction venture then to suggest that perhaps there may have be person person unknown in wood boy evidence be straightforward must not see through wood be true call up parish constable officer stood up to give evidence be asked if there be dangerous suspicious person in near village if have seen tramp sturdy vagabond gipsy in fact person who might reasonably be suspected of outrage there be one village said be quite quiet well behaved be asked if there be poacher about said there be poacher whom knew very well so did honour gamekeeper in month of may there be little nothing to poach excuse for going into wood besides why must go into wood at ten in morning be quite confident that village poacher have nothing to do with business suggestion sir said mr campaigne seems unproductive nevertheless there be chance that mystery might be explained if must in way light upon clue there be way of explanation said coroner grimly put other question to constable have seen gipsy tramp about village on road constable declared that have seen none that village lying a did off main road from be not even visible did not attract gipsy tramp vagabond of description have constable observed case of drunkenness have not there be men who sometimes took more beer than be good for carried liquor peaceably did not become quarrelsome in cup come next said coroner to question whether deceased gentleman have private enmity to fear to mr campaigne made reply brother in law sir be man who may have made enemy a magistrate especially among poacher if so enemy must be in own part of county fifteen mile away in place must have have friend enemy then gentleman of jury said coroner can find motive for crime said just now that there be explanation possible can put aside theory of poacher being disturbed at work theory of private enmity theory of tramp gipsy attacking for sake of robbery come back therefore to broad fact at ten in morning deceased entered wood alone at twelve man dunning ran out smock frock covered with blood said that have found dead body of gentleman lying on grass have tried to lift getting smock frock stained with blood in doing so now gentleman be good of trying to lift dead body on other hand suppose that man finding gentleman unarmed perhaps asleep conceived sudden thought of killing for sake of taking money suppose to have be disturbed to have thought disturbed might be by bird scaring boy what must do naturally must give alarm pretend that crime be committed by man gentleman of jury will form own conclusion will return such verdict a seems to reasonable leaving further investigation to law far be from to suggest verdict to influence judgment have now to consider how by whom murder a clear case of murder a have ever be known be committed jury considered verdict for hour then returned verdict of wilful murder against john dunning man be standing alone by time everybody shunned when verdict be given cried out never done never done passionately with show of passion constable arrested on spot after first ejaculation man became quite passive made kind of resistance coroner turned to mr campaigne be magistrate sir can formally commit man for trial commit man bereaved gentleman seemed to have difficulty in understanding matter however came to performed duty mechanically man john dunning now lie in gaol awaiting trial must not say anything to forejudge case certainly look black so far against accused to housekeeper added coroner court be full sorrowful sight be to see master tall handsome upright ashy pale on same day in afternoon buried brother sister in parish church lie side by side in chancel then followed report of trial of john dunning part of be repetition of evidence heard at inquest be defended by counsel very able counsel too young man who have taken greatest pain to get up case leonard knew name later on have become judge cross examination be keen searching little point be made most of report gave at full length evidence speech in place be sufficient to give most important question answer counsel have map of wood made great deal out of map called attention to distance for instance must take five minute only to get from wood to farm on point cross examined mr campaigne closely believe be small wood little more than coppice be very little more than coppice how long now must take to walk through wood from end to end not five minute be there seat in wood place where man might sit down none did friend express intention of lingering in wood be there reason why must linger in wood certainly not entered wood at quick pace so far a know intended to keep up be walking partly for exercise partly to look at condition of field there be seat in wood counsel returned to point be there fallen tree to sit down upon not to knowledge be morning for lying down on grass no there have be rain path be muddy grass be wet did suppose that deceased must loiter about in wet wood in mud in long grass in wood for two long hour think most improbable even impossible suggestion be that there be someone lurking in wood everything point to in opinion otherwise on theory of prosecution brother in law must have stood in wood doing nothing for nearly two hour because nobody dispute fact that prisoner entered wood little before twelve be so think be sorry to press mr campaigne on subject so painful have life to save do suppose that friend be one who must be likely to yield up life without struggle certainly not be strong resolute man again look at prisoner who be not more than five foot five do suppose that friend must stand still to be killed by little man like be absurd to suppose anything of kind might have be taken unawares then blow must have be at back of head now be in front do suppose possible that labouring man must on entering wood suddenly resolve upon taking strange gentleman life without motive not even with hope of plunder must rush upon find off guard succeed in taking life without receiving blow scratch certainly consider thing absolutely impossible do suppose that if improbability impossibility have taken place man must have run back covered with blood to tell what have found to pretend other man have done certainly boy who have already given evidence be recalled how long be after mr holme went into wood before john dunning went in be long time know fact already said judge two gentleman went out at ten must reach wood according to map about fifteen minute past ten dead body be brought home little after noon therefore a prisoner be only few minute in wood must have be about twenty minute to twelve that went in remained lord more than few minute so must seem from evidence much mischief however may be done in few minute counsel recalled doctor when saw body be think said little before one oclock be so body be then quite stiff dead say quite have be dead time perhaps two hour have be dead two hour be quite sure will not swear to exact time will say long while if boy evidence a to time occupied by prisoner in wood be correct death must have be caused few minute before men brought shutter body must have be quite warm must now saw wound indicate for jury exactly where be doctor laid hand on top of head not front top very good mr holme be six foot high look at prisoner be possible that so short man must have inflicted blow on top of head not unless found victim seated quite so have heard from mr campaigne that be impossible to sit down in wet wood thank one need not go on be most important part of evidence at first looked very bad against prisoner one else in wood blood on smock weapon with deed be accomplished apparent impossibility of anyone else being criminal then came clever lawyer upon scene in little while whole of case fell to piece first doctor evidence that death have be caused two hour before prisoner entered wood evidence of boy that prisoner have gone in only few minute before came out running be positive evidence in favour there be next evidence of mr campaigne brother in law be last man in world who must be murdered without making fight be powerful man much stronger than fellow charged with murdering be not taken unawares received fatal blow in full front again there be robbery if poor man commits crime of murder doe for revenge for jealousy for robbery there must be none of motif at work in murder of unfortunate gentleman lastly there be best possible testimony in favour of prisoner personal character be not of much use where evidence be strong when be weak may be of greatest possible help employer stated that prisoner be good workman who knew business that be sober industrious honest least likely man on farm to commit atrocious act judge summed up favourably jury retired to consider verdict came back after hour verdict not guilty quite right said leonard laying down book man john dunning certainly be innocent of charge then followed more writing by housekeeper when verdict be declared prisoner stepped down be greeted with friendly congratulation by master farmer others judge before leaving court sent for mr campaigne sir said shaking hand with have to deplore own loss a well a yours in melancholy event of day for own part although consider verdict of jury amply justified by evidence must like opinion on matter if be worth attention will hear have already made up mind on point evidence at inquest be quite incomplete after talking matter over with doctor be convinced that murder be most certainly committed long before man dunning went into wood at state of body showed if medical evidence be worth anything death have taken place two hour before be before eleven in fact shortly after left must have be walking straight to death when left saw striding along through wood have be able to form theory at none have there be robbery must have suspected gipsy own people about here be quiet harmless such thing a wilful deliberate murder must be impossible for so case only becomes more mysterious felt so strongly a to man innocence that not only provided with counsel also provided counsel with own full statement of case murderer of brother in law slayer of wife here mr campaigne turned very pale will be discovered time other must be discovered have understood that murder lie on conscience until life becomes intolerable then man confesses welcome shameful death to end let wait till murderer find burden too heavy to be borne yet said judge one must like to find out by mean of law well said mr campaigne for own part resolved must do in power so that innocent man must not suffer for guilty if must prevent sir said judge conduct be what world expects of noble gentleman there remains one conclusion be that there be someone concealed in wood boy said that one went out be thinking of two end must not perhaps see through wood beyond wood be not yet perhaps too late to search for footstep however doubt can be done will be done so trial be finished have not heard that further examination of spot be made a village people from neighbouring village nearest market town crowded over sunday for week after gazing at spot where body be found be of very little use to look for footstep man john dunning went back to work village folk old friend turned against must no longer associate with taint of murder be upon though be a innocent man a ever stepped vicar spoke to people be in vain anyone who have be tried for murder must be murderer be shunned like leper madman then vicar spoke about to squire who gave john money so that might emigrate with family went to botany bay where people be not convict be told there at least ought not to be thrown in man teeth that have be tried acquitted for murder have never heard what became of john dunning family afterwards squire offered reward of for apprehension conviction of person unknown who have murdered mr langley holme printed bill remained on church door for year long after rain have washed out letter until whole bill be finally washed out destroyed reward be never claimed be there attempt to fix guilt upon a time went on belief grew up in mind of world notwithstanding acquittal other be possible a criminal than john dunning so that be fortunate thing for that went away when did before popular belief be turned quite so dead against wood became haunted one dared pas through alone even by day because murdered man walked by day a well a by night can not say for that ever actually saw ghost not be to say to recognise poor gentleman though there be plenty of credible witness who swear to having seen in twilight in moonlight in sunshine one day when be walking home from village be in morning about eleven oclock saw strange thing made heart stand still be spring day with fresh breeze sunshine with flying cloud made light shadow over field in wood a be stated at trial be more of coppice than wood composed of slender tree such a birch be on one side fir larch on other with good deal of undergrowth among birch saw a clear a ever saw anything in life figure oh quite plain figure under birch among bush undergrowth knew there must be one there saw figure plain a figure of man woman have back to made out head shoulder arm rest of body be hidden while looked shadow passed away sun came out then figure disappeared waited for to return did not crept slowly through wood looking about fearfully to right left there be nothing bird be singing calling to other there be ghost yet have seen when asked how be dressed must not remember nay have not observed then there be to whom ghost have appeared clad a when met murderer to whom have spoken so that own evidence be not of so much importance a of others after funeral must not fail to observe great change in habit of master before trouble mr campaigne be man fond of society must invite friend to dinner two three time week be fond of bottle

child alike be unfortunate here ended housekeeper book of extract comment there be appended letter be headed mary letter september d dear lucy have not be able to answer letter before believe there be time when heart must be alone with heart have be alone with sorrowful heart oh sorrowful heart for month since happened can now tell something not have fallen upon upon innocent babe heard that langley took own life with own hand four week ago ask now why did be doing well one be more promising one have brighter prospect friend assured that in proper time might confidently expect to see in cabinet power influence name be improving daily be acquiring daily greater knowledge of affair at home may say truthfully that be happy with wife who must have laid down life cheerfully to make happy with tender child a for anything outside home such a young men permit must have such thought must not have a man who considered duty to wife family a christian yet killed oh dear killed be left why did do there be one thing always weighed heavily upon mind condition of father frequently talked of why asked must misfortune such a have befallen tragic death of friend sudden death of wife so completely destroy strong man young healthy capable of rising above greatest possible disaster why must misfortune change permanently so that must neglect everything that have formerly loved must become miserable silent solitary brooding over past living useless life of hermit of course felt also neglect in brother sister have be left lack of sympathy with father have always regarded for remember father be not insane be able to transact business perfectly be only that refuse to speak to converse life alone now dear lucy be not going to make suggestion want only to tell exactly what happened sent book of extract cutting with supplementary note cutting be contemporary account of murder of mr langley holme inquest trial of man who be acquitted strange effect whole produced upon mr campaigne then quite young man received book took into study be in morning at midnight looked in turned face dear be haggard asked what be matter that looked so ill replied rambling that father have eaten sour grape begged to leave off to come upstairs said something in reply did not catch so left never came upstairs at five in morning woke up finding that be not in bed hurried down stair full of sad presentiment ala be dead ask how be dead dear lucy be now only one left of three child have burnt book at event child will not see hear of terrible story implore to burn copy mr galley wrote after have read book again quite through can not understand at why brother killed a for murderer of course be man named john dunning who else must have be leonard looked up be three oclock in morning face be troubled with doubt misgiving why did burn book said a for murder there must have be someone hidden in wood be clear other explanation be possible why did grandfather cut throat there be nothing in book must lead to act chapter xii on site leonard shut book threw aside sat thinking over for little then thought be time to go to bed there be not much of night left in fact be already broad daylight if have be night of mid winter for darkness must not have be visited by more terrifying nightmare in sleep family history continued now took form of mystery mystery in shape sat upon afflicted chest groaned be unable to guess understand what kind of mystery be in sleep to connect with anything on earth in world outside earth woke up shook off went to sleep again returned unrelenting be vague vast terrible thing with sufferer wrestled in vain must not shake off must not comprehend there be many kind of nightmare of unintelligible mystery will not go away can not be driven away be one of worst when rose late in morning unrefreshed tired did connect nightmare with something intelligible arose from book story like chaucer be left half told that in must have mattered little strange thing happened began with morning there fell upon quite suddenly irresistible sense that here be duty laid upon duty not to be neglected thing have to be done to exclusion of everything else have to follow up story to recover after seventy year more true history of crime cast shadow so long so terrible upon year child of year looked at paper on table be half finished article have undertaken mind bidden to think upon subject rebelled refused to work must not be turned in direction went off to campaigne park to seventy year before without word leonard be mysteriously commanded to follow up story to proper conclusion without word be plainly unmistakably commanded to follow up by whom did not ask obeyed after seventy year discovery of guilty man must seem difficult find historian grappling with case of accused person forming conclusion absolutely opposite even when evidence seems quite full circumstantial in point take case of anne boleyn for instance that of mary queen of scot two of most illustrious most unfortunate princess what agreement be there among historian concerning lady yet there be monumental mass of document contemporary voluminous official private epistolary confidential partisan exist to help in case there be other document except in book of cutting that private investigation must do be to read evidence have already be submitted to two court to arrive if possible at conclusion leonard proceeded to do laid aside altogether work on have be engaged placed book before read whole content again word for word albeit with same strange shrinking then made note first referred to man dunning john dunning prisoner be rightly acquitted be most certainly innocent boy showed that have not be in wood more than two three minute deceased be man six inch taller than dunning strong in proportion latter must only have delivered fatal blow if have come upon victim from behind while be sitting medical evidence prof that blow must have be delivered from front be also proved that grass be too wet from recent shower for deceased to have be sitting down on ii time of death if medical evidence be worth anything man when found have be lying dead for about two hour a be proved by rigor mortis absolutely convinces one of dunnings innocence introduces certainty of hand whose there paused began to consider there must have be person in wood person must have rushed upon victim suddenly unexpectedly to rush out of wood armed with heavy club torn from tree be act of gorilla if there have be escaped gorilla anywhere about crime must have be fixed upon gorilla in year be not yet discovered perhaps assailant ran upon from behind noiselessly perhaps langley holme heard at last moment turned so that blow intended for back of head fell upon fore part be very well in theory why who wanted to kill young gentleman why there be robbery body lay for two hour more in unfrequented place there be plenty of time for murderer to take everything murderer have taken nothing then why how to explain here be young country gentleman highly popular if have enemy must not be outside own part of country most country gentleman in day have many enemy enemy who be rustic for most part satisfied revenge hatred by poaching on preserve also set fire to hayrick langley holme be staying welcome guest with friend brother in law be walking along on summer morning in wood not mile away from house park there be discovered lying dead murdered may be objected that attempt to solve insoluble after seventy year be waste of time that dead gone crime may a well be left alone other people crime may doubt be left alone be own crime so to speak crime inflicted in upon own family besides be dragged by rope to consideration of thing mind be wholly charged with must think of nothing else presently shaped theory at first seemed to fit in with everything be really very good theory promised when framed to account for fact brought out in inquest at trial theory supposed escaped lunatic homicidal maniac of course must account for everything maniac murderous maniac must have be lying concealed in wood must have rushed out armed with club like gorilla theory seemed to meet point in case shut up book have found out truth must now go about own work again forgetting mysterious murder drove great grandfather off balance sighed with satisfaction placed book in drawer out of way need not worry more about thing so with sigh of relief reached out for book returned once more to study of subject presently became aware that eye be resting on page without reading that mind be back again to book of extract that in brain there be forming without volition of own one two difficult question about maniac a for instance if there have be creature wandering in field someone must have seen must probably have murdered more than one person while be in mood for murder there be little boy for instance scaring bird must have killed little boy then fact of roving maniac must have be known must have escaped from somewhere madness must have be known there must have be sort of hue cry after either at inquest at trial there must have be mention of dangerous person going about at large suggestion that might have be guilty person dangerous maniac escape without notice taken warning that be loose no must not do more workable theory must be invented got poacher everybody know deadly hostility far worse seventy year ago than at present existed between country gentleman poacher latter be accustomed in day to get caught in mantrap to put foot into gin to be fired upon by gamekeeper to be treated like weasel stoat in return poacher manifested lamentably revengeful spirit sometimes went a far a murder in case doubt crime be committed by poacher theory satisfied at first just a much a predecessor presently however reflected that there be not much for poacher to do in early june that poacher prowl about wood covert in broad daylight at noon poacher a rule murder gentleman belonging to other part of country besides poacher on one estate must not bear malice against squire of estate fifteen mile distant leonard pushed paper away in despair other kind of work be impossible must think of nothing else at point however kind of relief came to for felt that must make personally acquainted with place wanted to see wood of so much mention be made place where blow be struck place where murderer lay hidden wanted evidence of wood be probably same now a have be seventy year before unless have be felled built over in part of country destroy wood build upon site be conservative country a field be hundred year ago so be now visitor to house most conveniently approach from metropolitan extension line go to rickmansworth amersham verney leonard resolved upon going there very morning took note book started setting down point on wished to inquire arrived at station little before noon walk of ten minute brought to house on terrace at back old man tall broad shouldered erect walked a usual up down with hard resolute air leonard did not speak to passed into garden looking at watch walked along grass grown walk at end turning to right entered park be small park there be only one walk in direction two must have followed be now like garden walk overgrown with grass at end there be lodge have stood empty for nearly seventy year gate be rusting on hinge window be broken tile have fallen off roof beyond park be open road highroad beyond road narrow path led across broad field into small wood on right hand be low rising ground then be wood where thing be done be hillside on boy be scaring bird when saw two go in one come out leonard crossed field entered wood looked at watch again have taken twenty minute to walk from house to road made note of fact walked through wood be pretty wood more like plantation than wood wood with few large tree many sapling two three tree lying on ground waiting to be cut up spring foliage be out dancing in sunlight varying light shade be pleasing restful air be soft bird be singing peaceful lovely place then be spot where langley holme be suddenly done to death by whom now a leonard stood looking into tangled mass of undergrowth curious thing happened be same thing have happened to housekeeper be mentioned in note by freak of light shade there be fashioned in part of wood where shade be darkest simulacrum spectre of man only shoulder upper part of man still man leonard be more superstitious than neighbour at ghostly presentment be startled for moment heart beat quickly with strange kind of terror unlike other be called supernatural there be men who boast that know not have never felt be men who must take work into deserted house must carry on serenely alone through watch of livelong night for own part envy not give indication of unseen world whisper of unseen spirit cold breath of unseen guest even though be received with terror superstitious shrinking be with such terror leonard saw apparition moment after be gone then perceived that be nothing shadow lying among undergrowth so that assumed solid form yet a to housekeeper to whom that same apparition have appeared seemed to actual phantom of murdered man retraced step took more than five minute found to walk through wood from one end to other be so small undergrowth of so light character with heavy foliage that person standing in part of must be easily visible must be impossible for man to conceal made note also of fact then remembered boy on hillside scaring bird there be boy at moment leonard walked up low hill in order to learn what boy have be able to see hill although low be good deal higher than tree in wood commanded view of land beyond wood field with young corn upon leonard observed that one must not see through wood that must see over beyond on side of if for instance anyone approached wood from direction ran away from must be quite possible for boy standing on hillside to see that person then in imagination heard boy evidence see squire gentleman with came a far a wood together presently squire went away by then john dunning came along presently came out running over to farm then brought shutter carried out something on covered up thats see word be so clear plain that when ceased looked round be astonished to find there be boy sat down on gate looked at note walk from house to wood took twenty minute time taken in walking through wood be five minute wood be nowhere thick enough to conceal man wood must not be seen through from hillside be overlooked on side from hill considered thing being now more than ever seized possessed with weight burden of mystery consider be ordinary crime such a one might read about when in annals of family one member of long time ago be brutally wickedly cut off be crime whose effect be felt by member of family in strange seclusion of head advantage might be possessed by member of ancient honourable house be lost for head of owner of property

cordiality proper for blessing retired chapter xiv consultation rle of coincidence in history of individual be much more important than writer of fiction have ever dared to represent not coincidence be dear to old fashioned dramatist when at very nick opposite point of time long lost earl return coincidence of real life doe not occur in way man mind be much occupied even absorbed by one subject go about thinking upon subject upon little else then kind of thing happen to illustrate subject be what coincidence mean for instance be once endeavouring to reconstruct for novel certain scene among overgrown byway secluded forgotten lane of history have nothing at first to help worse still must find nothing not even in british museum most profound knowledge of book pamphlet in collection in person of greatest scholar must not help be reluctantly making up mind to abandon project must have inflicted irreparable damage on novel when sheaf of second hand catalogue came to be by last evening post turned over two three without much curiosity until among item lit upon one caught eye be only title of pamphlet promised to contain exact information wanted promise be kept be too late to buy pamphlet have title be found for in british museum became crib now that if please be coincidence kind of coincidence happens continually to man who think about anything be said of most distinguished numismatist that can not cross ploughed field without picking up rose noble be because thought be always turned to rose noble other delightful coin if one be studying eighteenth century there be not museum picture gallery second hand catalogue doe not provide student with new information man absorbed in subject becomes like magnet attracts to kind of proof illustration light thing be mentioned only to show that apparently miraculous manner in external event conspired together to keep up interest in case be really remarkable exceptional for interest grip with story of newspaper cutting caught held reader be true miracle in group of situation there be central event in case mystery of wood be central event be murder leonard constance repeated a much a yours be great grandfather who be murdered if be great grandmother who be also killed by crime let sit with while work out too constance leonard saw in eye something reminded of own overpowering interest in thing too take back book leonard have read read over over again have be reading livelong night also feel with same did not finish sentence feel like constrained to go on why can not tell be not pity for one can not feel pity for man of whom one know nothing except that be young handsome unfortunate that be ancestor be not desire for revenge how can one take revenge for crime when everybody concerned be dead gone except man who suffered most except old old man well can not understand fact be so like be drawn by rope to subject a for can think of nothing else be wholly possessed by story by mystery will work at together if work be possible sat down together read book aloud making note read part of over again compared note went to club together dined together went home spent evening together separated with assurance that everything have be done must be done that must reluctantly abandon further investigation in morning met again be thinking last night said constance about inquest there be two three point be thinking about trial said leonard there be few doubt in mind let have out book again once more be produced once more lay on table once more sat on opposite side read considered took counsel together with result once more locked up book agreed that further investigation be impossible to morrow said leonard will go on with work again be like following of jack lantern to morrow said constance with sigh strange that must have be led to consider subject at let dead bury dead be old story nothing more remains to be found out why have be so foolish despite agreement continued at hopeless task sat together day after day during time talked thought of nothing else again again agreed there be nothing more to be found again again made show of putting book away locking up again again took out again read till knew by heart together went once more to campaigne park visited fatal wood wandered about deserted room of house haunted by dreadful memory how must expect to find anything now after year have said leonard repeating word hundred time evidence can now be discovered evidence of wood place evidence of one survivor evidence of trial if truth can not be discovered why must go on moreover after year nothing more can be discovered nothing more except hand did why must go on because must not choose go on be compelled to go on if spoke of other thing thought talk wandered back to same subject a may always happen when two person be engaged on subject absorbed in face assumed same expression that of one who search find not with face alchemist be accustomed day to enter laboratory hoping against hope beaten back evening returning in morning with difference for alchemist knew what wanted to find out two be in search of knew not what went together in vain hope of finding hearing something more to call upon lady of commercial road be most gratified to be recognised a cousin of young lady desired nothing better than to talk of family misfortune threw more light upon story knowing in fact le than knew left agreed once more that be absurd to continue quest so hopeless agreed once more to lock up book next day took out laid head together again how long be going to last constance asked dont know leonard replied wearily be possessed be bewitched be two person who believe in possession in witchcraft yet be really possessed dont know by whom why anything at about if there be not possession then old story mean nothing might make wax image call by name of witch stick pin in if knew name of witch why seems a if must speak think of nothing else if one be superstitious if echoed other doubtfully one be superstitious might seem like part of hereditary misfortune yet why must share in sorrow here blushed because remembered how before misfortune be even heard of have be invited to share in good fortune leonard observed nothing quest left room for thought of love no replied gravely must not share in trouble constance too ask day how long will last why can not throw off sense of being driven on against own will in search must be hopeless yes too be driven be to follow doe mean be imagination of morbid kind paused leonard made reply after continued there be nothing to do to accept situation to go on see what happens leonard groaned suppose said with wintry smile that be doomed to go on day after day till end of thing just a old man have walked up down terrace day after day for seventy year what fearful tramp what monotony what life dreary prospect yet to go over same story day after day day seems little better than walk up down terrace doe leave constance give up go back to own work took up fatal book threw to other end of room frankly must leave if must thing weighs upon understand what possession mean be possessed must follow constance be growing ridiculous be two person of culture talk of possession of unseen force drag since be dragged yes since be dragged crossed over room picked up book brought back be dragged let obey be then three week since inquiry have begun be now sole object of life hunted in british museum among old paper went to hall turned out desk drawer cupboard of letter document paper account found enough to reconstruct daily life of old man before tragedy history of predecessor be simple annals of peaceful country life with event one expects birth of child buying of land festivity know that when sisyphus have rolled ball be wheel to top of hill thing incontinently rolled way down again then with sigh prisoner walked after a slowly a be consistent with show of obedience began again so leonard with sigh began again when one theory after other broke down at point coincidence commenced be talking together one morning if said leonard must only hear man dunning on subject must be more interesting even than ancient boy who scared bird must be dead long ago yet if must be found at moment coincidence have explained can be considered remarkable leonard servant opened door brought bulky letter have australian postage stamp upon looked carelessly at address tossed on table to wait convenience a lay on back constance read printed across securing fold word john dunnings son john dunnings son said be strange took up letter pointed out name just a be talking of john dunning open letter leonard read oh be wonderful open at once leonard tore open envelope within there be letter enclosure read rapidly good heaven cried be actually voice of man constance be voice be asking for be voice speaking from grave read aloud letter enclosure following be letter dear sir found enclosed paper only yesterday though be written ten year ago grandfather by whom be written died very shortly after be written will not trouble with cause led to overlooking for so many year hasten to send on to in accordance with writer wish circumstance to refers happened seventy year ago doubt everyone who can remember event have long since departed suppose that even know fact to grandfather of vital importance that acquittal be secured by kind office of ancestor who be then owner of campaigne park suppose that have ever heard of great kindness sympathy desire for justice prompted good office of further generosity sent grandfather out to australia began life a agricultural labourer in england must have remained in humble position day for calamity turned out so great blessing trial for murder came out here died one of richest men in colony for everything that touched turned to gold paper enclose be proof that gratitude be not wholly dead in world gather from published note on member of parliament origin that be now head of house seeing that be distinguished in university of oxford be member of several club a well a in house suppose that there be anything can do to carry out wish of grandfather a regard personally may happen however that member of family might come out to country might not be so fortunate a in case will please to inform member worldly wealth be great that origin of property be generosity of ancestor that grandfather wish be command that there be nothing can do for member of family if opportunity must occur will not do cheerfully readily remain dear sir very faithfully yours charles dunning must very much like to make acquaintance of mr charles dunning said constance now for what grandfather say leonard opened other paper read being now in eighty sixth year therefore soon to be called away desire to place in writing in order that may be sent after death to present head of campaigne family first thanks heartfelt gratitude for what be done for by late squire in after trial for murder have enjoined upon child grandchild that be to part with last farthing if occasion arises for benefit of descendant of good man suppose that be dead beyond reach of prayer can only hope that speedily recovered from loss of dear lady that enjoyed long happy life be dreadful thing to be accused of murder life have remembered charge trial after case be over people of village be cruel hard charge be thrown in teeth day one must work with one must sit with so have to come away if there be anyone living who remembers case must ask to read to consider two point found out after trial be indeed voice of dead said constance speaking low first point be that have witness be too much stunned to think of who must prove be at work morning until just before noon in place second point may be more important path through wood lead to stile opening on lane to village of highbeech there be cottage in lane opposite stile on morning of murder woman of cottage be washing outside door told after trial that not soul have gone into wood from end of morning must not see other end saw coming down hill on way to wood have not be in wood minute before saw running back again up hill to farm yard on top hope that if there be doubt left in mind of anyone a to innocence new evidence will make clear paper be signed john dunning there be doubt left said constance still what bearing have evidence of cottage woman on case what do think have voice contributed anything will consider presently meantime wanted be to clear think be effectually done at trial still must naturally catch at anything like corroboration prof that one went into wood from other end a for anything else why must seem with boy evidence to mean that nobody went into wood at morning except two gentleman then come back to old theory lurking in wood of poacher madman private enemy asked for voice from grave came said leonard now seems to have told nothing placed paper in book leaving letter on table looked at other blankly then leonard rose walked about room finally took up position before fireplace began to speak slowly a if feeling way suppose that be natural must connect crime with great question about inheritance of punishment consequence be quite natural said constance yet mother grandmother a now understand believed that misfortune so carefully concealed from be inheritance of forefather sin since misfortune began with crime be natural that must attribute cause to ancestor who died before crime now can learn about ancestor be that be country gentleman justice of peace member of parliament that left behind record memory of anything uncommon now to produce enormous list of misfortune one must be gilles de retz at least be not acquainted with example be great master in kind of villainy about misfortune however great grandfather a know grandfather died by own hand brother be drowned at sea sister have be unfortunate throughout life son father died young uncle frederick went abroad under dread of disgrace may forget now have come home again list of misfortune be long enough can not learn cause may even to superstitious account for under anything of inheritance why must try to account for misfortune be not caused by try because be part of whole business can not escape forget chain of misfortune if only must leonard be so long ago misfortune have fallen upon oh what did say once in very room misfortune have fallen upon be knowledge of misfortune ruined life old selfish contentment be gone lived for myself be henceforth impossible well shook a dog after swim be now what wanted to be like other people relapsed into silence can not choose said presently connect misfortune with first greatest point of doubt be whether to speak of consequence punishment must be one other child must suffer for father sin be most certain if father throw away property son becomes pauper if father loses social position child sink down with if father contract disease child may inherit be obvious can not be disputed be not punishment for generation of innocent child be consequence not punishment must not confuse two take case of crime body mind soul be connected together so that face proclaims mind mind present soul criminal be diseased man body mind soul be connected together life in evil atmosphere thought action impulse be evil be wrapped in miasma like low lying meadow on autumn morning child may inherit disease of crime just a may inherit consumption gout be to say be born with tendency to crime a may be born with tendency to consumption gout be not punishment repeat be consequence in such child there be open door to evil of kind other since men have weakness fault there must be always open door to child suppose so son of man reputed blameless whose weakness fault be presumably light venial be le drawn towards open door than son of habitual criminal son of criminal naturally make for open door be easy way be consequence a for own trouble perhaps if knew too may be consequence not punishment know can not find crime criminal chapter xv barlow brother theory of consequence leonard be arranging thought on paper for better clearness while answer most of difficulty connected with hereditary trouble break down must be confessed in case given for instance case in boy be carefully educated have bad example before show sign of vice be ignorant of family misfortune if boy becomes spendthrift prodigal worse when there have never before be thing in family how can connect case with fault vice of grandfather altogether unlike own unknown to must be inclined rather to ascribe case to influence of past not to be discovered due to maternal ancestry man for instance may be so completely unlike other member of family that must search for cause of early life in line of mother grandmother be just then thinking of uncle returned colonial in whom except for commanding stature still handsome face there be nothing to remind world of paternal side whenever thought of cheerful person with whom life seemed pleasant play certain doubt crossed mind ran like cold water down back have come home rich be something might have come home a poor a when started rich poor must have be same a buoyant a loud a unpresentable in fact at very moment when reflection be forming part of leonard great essay on after effect of evil essay created only last month so great stir people talked of little else for whole evening rich australian be on way to confess fact that thing be not exactly a have chosen to present did confess truth a much of truth a must afford to express in easy irresponsible manner a if nothing mattered much be philosopher to whom nothing did matter came in shook hand laughed buoyantly chose cigar from leonard box rang bell for whisky few bottle of soda when whisky soda have arrived be within reach took chair laughed again boy said im in tight place again in what way why for want of money thats only possible tight place at age at yours there be many be only temporary tightness of course opened soda water drank off full tumbler at gulp temporary till supply arrive supply put question in nasty cold suspicious manner must have changed smile into blankness in more sensitive person uncle fred be by mean sensitive thin skinned be also so much accustomed to temporary tightness that incongruity of tightness with pretension of prosperity have not occurred to supply replied supply from australia of course thought that be partner in large prosperous concern quite true quite true barlow brother be large prosperous in case be easy for to draw upon banker agent for bank friend in city go into city day believe position must be well known in other word mistrust temporary tightness mistrust from really leonard put thing together find in none of habit of responsible merchant know that everywhere character be essential for commercial success character what must be without character come home a successful merchant drink talk a if be debauched youngster about town anecdote be scandalous taste be low be outward sign be on holiday out there very different a for drink of course in thirsty climate like of new south wale place one must drink little for own part be surprised at own moderation very well will not go on with subject only to repeat if be in tight place who know solvency will be very willing to relieve hope be not here to borrow of because man laughed again not nobody be likely to borrow of leonard be quite certain not even stoniest broke make mind quite easy a for friend in city know very well what to do about be here because want to throw upon family family consists of brother who may be able to help ive asked wont christopher be always selfish

want money get from lawyer thousand can not get anything a for have not got thousand pound in world forget that have be mother small fortune of few hundred year be not in power to lend anything laughed again in enjoyment of situation delicious said said that wasnt going to borrow anything be to be british swell well dont mind will draw upon at six month come long before time will be in fund

coffee plantation be idea be bold idea at rate be a for barlows general store confess between ourselves considering that dont belong to city dont mind owning up to that be little better than shanty where sold sardine tea leaf bacon capability dear boy capability brought project to london well there have be greater robbery uncle fred took glass of whisky soda laughed no more even sighed thought

disgraceful why everybody knew a say why rake up old scandal at time when happened why a say why indeed except to make quite sure that there be longer shred of family pride possible for now learn on own confession that entered upon general course of imposition deception by have managed to live ever since to maintain family with credit because have escaped detection excuse dont call deception nobody be deceived except pleasantly be wrong to present fellow creature in agreeable quite unexpected character before world can blame for raising standard of after dinner oratory can blame for creating reputation by dozen make doubt that persuaded that be laudable honourable nevertheless must consider how grew told be good after dinner speaker be hard up then man old friend now colonial judge came to for help wrote speech bought be to say lent ten pound for really bought secrecy thats how began money be necessary there be unexpected way of making money so spread have doubt that practice of imposition be duly paid for must consider really there be nothing envied so much a reputation of good after dinner speaking supply reputation people go where be likely to hear good speech

speaker supply speech for occasion keep up reputation of city for eloquence why be rapidly sinking be already acknowledged to be far below american level then came raised standard after dinner speech mine be becoming part of national greatness why because sir christopher campaigne took in hand yet in secrecy carry on business alone hitherto without recognition time may come when national distinction will be offered to in fact after dinner demosthenes look so far forward confess that work be light easy to at least pleasant be also well paid people be willing to give great deal for reputation a can make for nobody ever want to see nobody know who be nobody want to know be natural come to think of whole business be done by correspondence work for none person of wealth position confidence be respected on side sometimes whole of dinner so to speak pass through hand have even known occasion on have sat unrecognised at dinner table listened to speech being delivered well ill through whole evening imagine if can glow glory of such evening can imagine ruddy hue of shame after five twenty year of deception however there be not much shame left what have happened now have be found out suppose yes have be found out there be little mistake sent man wrong speech response instead of proposer speech to proposer sent same speech in duplicate can not imagine how mistake be possible happened may imagine feeling of poor young man who heard own brilliant speech be in pocket actually delivered few word only changed by man whom be about to answer when turn came rose be overcome blurted out three four word sat down oh then in morning came to beard in own den have never seen before knew address came with big stick being little man ho ho marched in flourishing stick must have seen when stood over with office ruler laughed again at sight of leonard dark face checked sense of humour well misfortune be that know fellow at home come to place know worse than own son algernon be with to see fair oh algernon be with then algernon know yes know packed off fellow have out with algernon be tough business im sorry for algernon perhaps wont put on quite so much side though yes repeated thoughtfully have out with young man know now what real profession be well what next dont know what next will continue trade of deception falsehood will go into workhouse upon word must be better uncle rose took up hat well leonard if have nothing reproach may a well go did think that must consider position very difficult position have at least supported family have confided whole to if have nothing to say except to harp upon deception a if mattered may a well go stop let consider thing be there other way of livelihood none only question be whether be to conduct business henceforth under own name not dont know can advise help in way why did come to came for advice if have to give came because misfortune have fallen upon be reputed to be wise beyond year fact of occupation be misfortune enough well have nothing more to say then must go looked so miserable that leonard forgot indignation inclined heart to pity be afraid of exposure said on account of wife child on account alone for own part have done wrong fear exposure be brave word be a donkey in lion skin spoke valiantly knee trembled must think leonard replied that young man for own sake must be careful not to spread abroad experience because must expose a well a proposed deliberately to impose upon audience a own oration prepared by man bought by be position if be known published even le dignified than own think that algernon must put side of case to strongly plainly may leave out whisper rumour abroad algernon must warn against such thing if however man persists in unholy ambition to obtain false reputation will probably have to come to again since there be other practitioner mr crediton jumped in chair thats point youve hit thats real point im glad came here he not only got ambition still he got failure to get over must come to there be other practitioner must come never thought of that rubbed hand joyously may not be clever enough to see point therefore algernon have better put to if algernon fails must make clean breast to wife daughter send round openly among personal friend that be willing to supply speech confidentially that seems only way out of only way only way leonard there will be clean breast at that venomous beast will have to come to again be so glad that came here have got more sense than rest of put together chapter xvii yet when be gone leonard threw into nearest chair looked around gazed with bewildered face not upon study full of book paper showed man of learning report spoke of man of affair engraving on wall spoke of man of culture be accidental anyone may show artist sprung from gutter self made mere mushroom might posse exhibit thing saw strewn around wreck ruin of that have hitherto considered essential namely family honour there be none so full of family pride a who show least to leonard have always be greatest happiness merely to feel that record of family went back to time beyond memory of man be not thing to be talked about prop stay shield anything help to make man at peace with one knew when campaignes first obtained estate in century found ancestor not distinguished indeed have never produced man of first rank playing part that not unworthy one be record of honourable line there be traitor turncoat in men be without reproach woman without spot stain among suppose that nobody at school college ever knew suspected profound pride lay at heart of quiet possessed scholar be kind of pride be free from arrogance be gentleman people have be gentleman by gentleman meant people of good birth breeding of blameless life word well know be now used so a to include greater part of male man to most people mean nothing matter nothing even with people who use limitation door be always open to who choose to lead gentle life be privileged to follow work belongs to gentle life be gentleman people have feeling of superiority not least no more than man may entertain feeling of superiority on account of stature have least feeling of contempt for who have such advantage man who have grandfather may affect to despise one who have grandfather not man who have long line terminating like ancestry of saxon king in dim shape be probably woden thor freyya grand essential of family pride be ancestry honour former can not very well be taken away without latter be not worth much one might a well take pride in belonging to long line in gallant highwayman footpad costers hooligan marylebone boy have succeeded other for generation with accompaniment distinction of tyburn tree cart tail therefore say leonard sat among ruin of essential regardless of accidental man who have just left have stripped off be left of former pride must feel further support solace in contemplation of forefather think what have learned endured in le than month be line upon line precept upon precept be like unto patriarch to whom while one messenger of evil be speaking there came also saying thus thus have be done where be now thy pride first learned that have cousin living in one of least desirable quarter of london man cousin must not by possible stretch be considered a possessing of attribute of gentleman girl occupied station followed calling be respectable belonging to generally adopted by poor relation be thus provided with poor relation constance have said that wanted poor relation in order to be like other people then came a if in answer to word have learned also that grandfather almost at outset of promising career have committed suicide for reason must be discovered that father have died young also at outset of promising career be misfortune not blot two person be left of father generation have welcomed one a prodigal who have gone forth to husk returned bearing sheaf of golden grain at least there be pretence of golden grain other have regarded life with respect a one in successful practice in most honourable profession where be now one be bankrupt grocer general store keeper owner of shanty in australian township miserable little general shop selling sardine tea oil blacking wanted to turn into company a great business one who made pretence at truth honesty companion of tramp devoid of honour even respect care for honour have be driven out by family a spendthrift profligate forger have come home unchanged unrepentant ready to swindle to cheat if must do so without customary penalty a for other man pretended barrister stood revealed a one who be living under false pretence have equal right to stand in pillory beside brother once prodigal spendthrift like now living daily lie have carried on for five twenty year good heaven christopher campaigne barrister at law of lincoln inn successful lawyer on whom family reposed confidence so profound pride so unbounded who doe not take pride in successful lawyer be nothing more than common pretender impostor wrote speech sold to humbug who wished to be thought clever speaker honourable occupation delightful work proud distinguished career so there be nobody left except to maintain family honour certain word have already heard came back again seemed to a if constance be saying over again be independent a to fortune be of good house have scandal in family record have got poor degraded relation be outside humanity if have family scandal poor relation who must make feel ashamed something made like other people vulnerable now have door be opened servant brought card mr samuel galley campaigne leonard groaned sprang to foot sight thought of man caricature of own family tall thin like with feature vulgarized meanness of petty gain petty care petty scheming seeking stamped upon face irritated leonard unspeakably be cousin stiffened involuntarily attitude expression became that of supercilious beast formed by mr galley on previous business cousin came in bowed slightly not holding out hand there be look in face meant resolution held back by fear desire to try on something doubt a to whether must be successful be expression may be remarked on change in market town on market day have be wisely perhaps frequently remarked that trouble brings out man true character far more certainly than prosperity may encourage to assume virtue not really own line about us of adversity must be referred to bystander rather than patient because former be then enabled to contemplate observe true man for first time mr galley for instance who be smug in prosperity be openly undisguisedly vulgar in adversity at moment for instance be struggling with adversity made red in face made speak thick made perspire inconveniently made attitude ungraceful came up stair knocked at door with expression of fixed resolution one might have expected to bang fist on table to cry out there thats what want thats what mean to have did not quite do intended to do when called must have done have doubt for cold quiet air with cousin received mr campaigne began cousin if like mr campaigne perhaps said leonard supercilious well mr campaigne then ive come to have few word of explanation explanation sir repeated with fierceness by mean pray take chair took chair be then seized by doubt of have spoken perhaps cause be commanding position of cousin standing over six foot three in height with face like of judge not personally interested in case before point be ive got bill against family want to know whether be to present to to great grandfather bill of what nature bill for maintenance have maintained grandmother for fifty year have be kept partly by grandfather partly by family partly by time that family must do duty be very remarkable claim putting at year be cheap for lavish way shes be kept that make at compound interest mount up to odd will be contented to square claim for propose to send in bill bill for keeping own grandmother be just what be going to do must surely be aware that claim must not be entertained for moment court of law must so much a look at be aware of fact be not claim of ordinary kind be claim rest on equity on equity not on law what be equitable side of claim well way grandfather who failed for enormous amount showed position occupied in city married grandmother in reasonable expectation that must bring fortune be true that old man be then not more than fifty so did not count so much on will a on settlement understand that marriage be undertaken without consultation with great grandfather under circumstance with solicitor be doubt case when one marries into so wealthy family when head of be not in position to be consulted least can be expected be settlement settlement of kind grandfather said that expected nothing le than twenty thousand twenty thousand dated subsequent misfortune to failure of expectation because got nothing perhaps mr campaigne a be not born then can hardly believe that got nothing be in ignorance of whole business quite so quite so think therefore be quite justified in asking people to pay just bare sum out of pocket expense have expended upon grandmother oh tone be not encouraging other man be not versed in external sign went on unabashed saw other day style in live believe mr campaigne will acknowledge that be noble tea leonard bowed solemnly account rendered under circumstance for maintenance of grandmother mother wife must myself tear up throw into fire be concern of mine can send claim to great grandfather great grandfather a much a yours to solicitor whose name address probably know if not will furnish with if be have to say moved towards door mean have right to expect fortune there have be none said that before again mr galley can not discus matter with take claim to right quarter im not obliged to keep old woman replied sulkily decline to discus view of duty want to wake up old man to sense of justice will too if he mad will find out if isnt will make pay even if have to expose leonard stepped to door threw open mr galley rose face betrayed many emotion in fact conversation have not proceeded quite on line hoped dont be in hurry said give little time leonard closed door returned to hearth rug take time mr galley dont want said to behave ungentlemanly im in desperate trouble if think good sending in claim withdraw fact be mr campaigne want money want money desperately leonard made reply be discouraging ive be speculating in house property backing builder man be going be have happened to if cant raise thousand pound in course of day two must go too will not raise anything by sending in bill for maintenance of grandmother put that out of head mr galley groaned then will lend thousand pound mr campaigne be very friendly when came to see other day security be first class shell of three unfinished house will give eight per cent for accommodation good security good interest there be come mr campaigne be not business man dont think can make a rule more than three per cent at outside have money either to lend to advance have be to bank wont look at business mean creeping miserable bank will change well mr galley be sorry to hear that be in trouble can not help if do go bankrupt said savagely old woman will go into workhouse thats one consolation shes great aunt forget sister mr galley from what know of board school must say that be quite able to maintain grandmother if not there may be other assistance there thing then persisted when spoke to first mentioned word accumulation one mention other word just now think leonard replied with touch of temper must be enormous ive be working out enormous that old man cant live much longer cant he ninety five mr galley put to a lawyer at least a solicitor do think that great grandfather have lived year without making will cant make will be madman ask solicitor for opinion on subject old man will not speak receives communication give instruction will dispute will if im not named in will expect full share will show that he madman a please meanwhile be doubtful whether testator ever heard name know daughter name whats hers be mine must open door again mr galley if talk nonsense hear by way that have made that lady sign certain paper a solicitor must know that such document must be regarded by court with extreme suspicion if have to go bankrupt will let whole world know that wouldnt lift finger to save own cousin a please if there will turn out ill drag whole thing into court expose will expose by leonard opened door again time mr galley will go obeyed dropped hat on head marched out bawled on stair a went down ill expose ill expose ill expose terrifying
