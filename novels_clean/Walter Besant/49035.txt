to be eagerly sought after by countless thousand because also like elixir continually eludes pursuer one man succeeds how doe not know doe not inquire thousand others who think be a good fail why can not discover of thousand failure be ready to show thousand reason why one man have succeeded first of have really not succeeded secondly success be grossly exaggerated thirdly be cheap success unsuccessful be especially contemptuous of cheap success must not condescend to cheap success fourthly be success arrived at by tortuous winding crooked art make unsuccessful sick sorry to contemplate who must desire success achieved by climbing up back stair if man writes succeeds in writing so that ordinary people flock to read succeeds by vulgarity succeeds by low taste who respect must pander to multitude succeeds by vacuity fatuity futility stupidity what self respecting writer must sink to level of fatuous vacuous succeeds with because be asinine with b because be bestial with c because be contemptible so on through alphabet similar reason be assigned when man succeeds a painter sculptor preacher lawyer now sir robert steele be one of most successful physician of day success be easily understood readily accounted for on principle just laid down by of profession who have not by mean achieved same popularity humour patient one know that have soft voice warm hand make ignoble profit out of above asks patient of to most delightful dinner possible latter charge have foundation in fact doe ask few of more fortunate patient to dinner more than give dinner much too artistic for most of to understand to bring art into menu to invent build up dinner will be completely artistic in part harmonious whole one course leading naturally to next dinner of one colour in many tint wine gurgling like part of orchestra be gift within power of very few sir robert reputation a physician be justly at least assisted by reputation a great poetic creator of harmonious dinner think having none of gourmet gift that possession of must cause continual poignant unhappiness be like endowment of critical faculty at highest nothing plea wholly when critic of menu dines out ala what false note what discord what bad time what feeble rendering what platitude of conception must endure let not envy gift let rather continue to enjoy unheeding dinner must be only prolonged torture to sensitive soul of perfect critic doctor made selection carefully from patient friend knew amusing people about town especially benefactor to kind who consent to play sing for after dinner amusement knew actor especially who take too seriously knew men who can tell story sing song be always in good temper loved a king william loved red deer esteemed higher than prince more excellent company than poet more clubable than painter among friend of profession be mr richard woodroffe whom doctor esteemed even above fellow for unvarying cheerfulness great gift grace in music in song invited to dinner on certain evening partly on account of gift partly for reason other guest be haverils who must be useless in conversation miss molly pennefather cousin who must not probably prove leader in talk sir humphrey woodroffe whom invited for reason know others yet conscious beforehand that young man must be out of element perhaps sulky two umbr person of account mere patient to make up number of eight only number unless be four be permissible for dinner party for menu there be only one person to be considered dick for instance must eat tough steak with a much willingness a chateaubriand mr haveril knew not one dish from humphrey whom have met at mother table must be only guest capable of understanding dinner moreover humphrey must have to be conciliated by dinner to make up for company doctor therefore prepared dinner of few plat harmonized with desire of pleasing young man who be most easily approached have already discovered by mean of one group of sens dinner a artistic soul know appeal to group of sens be reason why civilized man decorates table unhappy person to whom dinner be feeding might a well serve up single dish on one wine case sit down to on reason apart from social quality why sir robert invited richard woodroffe to dinner be not unconnected with little conversation held at smoking concert few night before be very good smoking concert highly distinguished company be present performer be professional richard did turn then took seat beside sir robert have seen since last june dick have have be on tramp what do go on tramp for because must when summer come ca stay in town take fiddle sling hand bag over shoulder go off where do go anywhere first by train twenty mile so out of london then plunge into country at random tramp along road then well see real point be

wasted cuisine must meet with appreciation must have before mother son stepson if richard must be called stepson half brother master of situation must study on spot illustration of heredity

woodroffe again name said alice yes distant cousin be musician dramatist in small clever way dick be oldest friend said molly be very glad then that be coming to night sir robert considered young lady more attentively because girl who be dick woodroffe oldest friend must be young lady out of common there be observed something certainly uncommon in appearance something might suggest footlights old friend of dick woodroffe must suggest footlights be strange said doctor to have three of small party belonging to same name other guest arrived last be humphrey looked round room with expression of

voice saw eye be back again after year with vagrant man vagabond in moral a well a in way man who so cruelly used comedian stroller doctor also watched two young men have to begin with many point of resemblance be alike however a brother who often differ in disposition a much a stranger elder of two doctor considered mr haveril took after mother be serious at least thought of lady woodroffe remark about selfish yes there be way of eating food absorbing wine betokened selfish pleasure in food above delight of society conversation did not converse sat glum ill conditioned bad tempered lady woodroffe said selfishness probably bad temper inherited from father from education obtained of course air of superiority like order of garter have nothing to do with intellect achievement distinction from education also feature have probably acquired certain manner call aristocratic kept guest in something like good temper by asking opinion pointedly a if valued judgment on champagne have little talk with on vintage year brand in young man be a wide a most youth at club where champagne flow asked sir humphrey opinion on plat let others feel that opinion carried weight so that guest forgot something of molly perverseness in listening to neighbour story of intolerable nuisance of sitting down to dinner with company turned to other cousin dick fellow like unto humphrey be yet so much unlike to begin with face be a undistinguished a be cousin mind yet clever face capable of many emotion be full of life talk be interested in everything must listen a well a talk young man of sympathy artistic side of came from father a did also nomad side of sympathy kindliness honesty came to from unknown mother one supposed a for john haveril be chiefly engaged in considering girl who have thus

person have not be brought up to think of beauty lovely dress charming air grace a belonging to in way be sense of being outside circle make working men apparently deaf blind to beauty adorned cultivated why admire think upon unattainable might a well yearn after possession of ancient castle noble name a after beauty decorated set off now girl belonged to wife be only happy when girl be with came day to see drove out with took to see thing taught what to admire what to buy dined with consented graciously to accept gift refused money at event refused to take yet liked thing that money can buy lovely frock glove hat ribbon lace gold chain bracelet necklace to contempt for money combined with love of what only money can buy seemed incongruous contempt be only phrase molly have be taught that art ought to despise wealth have not be taught to despise thing artistic that money can buy rich man chuckled to think how much money can be spent upon girl who despises be pleased to make girl happy by heaping unaccustomed treasure on gratified shoulder be pleasant to be generous to bright happy smiling girl who kept alive made forget burden of rich a thought of thing fell into third manner that of gardener eye went off into space after dinner molly sat down to piano began to sing in full flexible contralto old ditty about love flower taught by dick who possessed treasure house full of such song new old of country in language there be one theme fit for song theme of youth love sweet season of rose humphrey stood listening to young man perhaps to others effect of molly singing a of presence of voice of eye be to fill mind with vision came to in shape of dancing girl with tambourine castanets when girl be endowed with real faculty of singing may create in mind of who hear vision best fit inclination nature to young man came troop of dancing girl because disposition inclined way sang a danced threw up white arm to music of wild reckless joy filled with longing yearning for delirium of youth rapture seizes young man from time to time sometimes posse day of youth cast out long before youth be over to husk among swine others more fortunate feel yearning too make of stimulus incentive there be such rapture beneath sky a young men dream of yet vision may make poet may strengthen for endeavour may fill with worship of woman be one thing needful for man humphrey wholly filled possessed by rapture must not be cast forth to husk because oh sordid reason mother must pay debt ala poor molly so ignorant have such vision girl never do when young men reel

humble rle of prodigal girl be to minister a with white arm castanets to service of prodigal son for too have to go out presently to sit with swine to maintain precarious existence on husk molly have such vision yet by mere power of voice must awaken vision in mind of listener be power make actress make queen make lady of authority whom obey to whom power appeal molly say have respect at for flowery way must not understand did ask why young men must want to dance hand in hand with girl why like to crown head with rose why drink huge draught of wine fizzeth in cup to make head a light a

young man who be admonished by swift not to set up for wit because said there be ten thousand chance to one against young man took that advice be therefore unknown to history at table conversation be difficult not so much because there be wit among small company a because there be opportunity for display of wit be necessary for wit to have something to work upon there can be repartee where there be talk be also difficult if think of to provide conversation for elderly gentleman who for greater part of life have be more accustomed to pork bean than to ctelettes la soubise who have habitually

because dream of so much can not think of a dead oh dick if must find son for dear lady will do what can must think said molly morning noon night about nothing else consult violin may whisper into

after can not tell who else be concerned let consider indian ayah now one doe bury child adopt child without other people knowing ca do servant must know perhaps child be substituted have be done believe servant must know secret then there be undertaker who buried child place where be buried if knew name of child believe must be easy after to trace then there be place where child died be often that child dy in hotel there be doctor who attended child might remember case if only knew name of child without that be powerless told dick said molly that want to find clue if knew name of child must go on quite easily without very likely continued there be concealment be open adoption known to everybody concerned who be only three people then why did lady conceal name be probably anxious that child must not know relation at perhaps dick if be to go away think for bit molly insisted oh yes presently meantime there be one very simple way will spend money john will let spend a much a please very well then sat down took pen paper most simple way be to advertise let world know what want offer reward same a for lost dog what do think of 'whereas in month of february child be adopted by lady unknown in city of birmingham mother of child will be most grateful to lady who adopted if will send name address to ' what will say ' r w care of hall porter dumfries flat ' will receive letter reward be coming to molly 'in case of lady death reward of will be paid for such information a will enable child now young man of twenty six if be living to be identified nothing will be given for information except such a be capable of proof person will be received verbal communication will be heard there molly what do think of might have be observed that then afterwards did richard consult mr haveril took conduct of case into own hand molly dick knew be awfully clever think splendid way a if such thing a advertisement be entirely novel previously unknown yes said dick contemplating document with pride flatter that be good idea look well on paper doe held at arm length to catch noontide sun there be legal 'note a say about well now molly let see how will work if adoption be real somebody must know of whether lady be living dead then will get reply in day two in day two alice think of if be substitution will get reply from lady then may expect that other people know about servant such then reward come in oh be clever alice in week at least will have boy now go dick concluded with one more admiring glance at paper before folded up put advertisement in leading paper over country keep going for week unless hear something let live in hope meantime sir robert read advertisement over breakfast ah said have found adviser mean business will spend money what be good can just prove nothing be master of situation yet there remained uneasiness for although be master of situation might be at cost of declaring swearing in court that still knew nothing a to name position residence of lady lady woodroffe read advertisement a well one of secretary pointed out to a interesting item in day news read held paper before face to hide guilty pallor heart sank low dreadful thing be already in paper soon perhaps must appear again with name attached to next morning letter be received by advertiser enclosed advertisement cut out of paper with word need not advertise more child have be dead for twenty year now richard read letter twice before began to think about doe mean if be adoption why not come forward if be substitution then child may be dead may not think be for part believe be try on to make give over will not give over dear madam continued advertisement therefore for week yet there came more letter discovery oh dick have be waiting day after day must change advertisement anonymous letter prof pretty clearly that there be reason for concealment else why did not writer sign name be in lady handwriting not servant adoption therefore to put kindly be not generally known let alter advertisement will now put in few more detail will leave mother out will no longer address lady in consequence of resolution following advertisement appeared next day whereas in month of february in city of birmingham child adopted by lady to take place of own recently dead be taken to railway station be there delivered to lady carried to london reward of two thousand guinea will be given to person who will give such information a may lead to discovery identity of child nothing will be given for proffered information doe not lead to such discovery identity advance will be made for expense of travelling other expense person will be received who offer verbal information address by writing only to r w care of hall porter dumfries flat dare say that many of reader will remember interest nay racket created by appearance of strange series of advertisement be never explained mystery be still referred to a illustration of romance in upper circle of american paper quoted a proof of profligacy of aristocracy concluding that be substitution of gutter child for scion of baronial stock time there be shoal of answer came by hundred came from part of country one must think that adoption by purchase be recognized form of creating heir to estate one railway porter wrote from birmingham stating that remembered affair perfectly well because lady gave sixpence that saw lady into carriage carrying baby be dressed in white clothes with woollen thing over face that on receipt of travelling money trifle of on account must run up to london identify baby person conveyed startling intelligence that be mother of child that must tell by whom be adopted child said be now belted earl conscience upbraids better crust with reward than prick of guilty conscience third wrote with warmth of man of world did advertiser believe that be such juggins a to give away story without making sure of reward if so writer preferred to think that be dealing with man of honour a well a man of business therefore must propose sure certain plan there must be in delicate affair certain amount of confidence on side writer knew whole history be curious valuable concerned certain noble house have proof in hand be prepared to send up story with proof nobody must question after once reading by return of post there must be show of confidence on side for be ready to confide in promise to pay reward let confide to extent in mere trifle must do twentieth part of reward say hundred pound let advertiser send sum to in registered letter care of dog duck aston terrace birmingham in ten pound note by return post must follow proof if a might happen writer thought best in such matter to be extremely prudent advertiser did not trust plan have brother in respectable way in coffee house lodging for single men kingsland road let money be deposited in hand to be held until proof voucher have be received nothing must be fairer than proposal so on so on richard greatly enjoyed letter human face said may differ leg be long short eye be straight skew human mind when two thousand pound be involved be apparently always same meantime be disappointing be not bit advanced in inquiry sir robert read advertisement a well be well advised said be going right way to work calculate that servant know offer big reward if doe fetch there will be bigger be good be good nobody know what know thought best however to reassure lady woodroffe hoped said that must have further occasion to speak about certain transaction suppose however that have heard of certain advertisement have do think think nay be certain lady woodroffe remember that there be only one person who know two woman engaged in transaction stood between be not going to bring together unless desire to do so came to say in case must be in least degree uneasy thank sir robert answered humbly trusted in square jawed beetle browed man yet be humiliated certainly confide in got up then will waste time no longer be always at work see read hear always at work good work good work lip parted be silent did mean reflection on one work have not be quite so good be gone advertisement be repeated in paper england scotland ireland colony knew about adoption anxiety of mother to recover son at stage of investigation subject began to be generally talked about newspaper have leading article on general subject of adoption be opportunity for display of classical scholarship of medival scholarship of historical scholarship case of pretence of substitution be not uncommon there be noble house about thing be whispered thing must not be bruited abroad subject of adoption open concealed proved fertile fruitful to leader writer one man for instance projected in imagination into situation speculated on effect must be produced on young man of culture fine feeling of finding out at five twenty that belonged to quite family with quite set of tradition prejudice idea thus young man born in purple near brought up in great respect for birth connection family history with strong prejudice in favour of aristocratic caste suddenly discovers that people belong to lowest grade of who can call of middle class that have kind of connection with folk to whom have always believed attached what must be effect upon educated sensitive mind what must be effect upon affection how must regard new mother probably vulgar old woman new brother sister probably preposterous in vulgarity what effect must discovery have upon view of life what upon politics what upon opinion a to small trade mean undignified sordid employment by bulk of mankind have to live at dinner table people talked about mysterious adoption what must mean why did not lady come forward be a of paper argued clearly case of fraudulent substitution if not why did not come forward be dead perhaps if so why did not one else come forward if however really be case of substitution then position be intelligible for instance case quoted day before yesterday by daily news be surely similar case so on speaker wise with knowledge derived from yesterday paper be sufficiently grateful to daily paper leader writer for providing with subject of conversation subject be handled with great vigour one night at lady woodroffe own table sir robert be present argued with ability that there be reason to suppose deception at in view lady have adopted child have resolved to bring up child in complete ignorance of relative who be presumably of lowlier sort that have seen reason to take servant into confidence friend that now saw reason to let young man learn who real relation be drew really admirable sketch of disgust with young man must receive new cousin lady woodroffe while agreeable discussion be continued sat at head of table calm pale collected then there appeared third advertisement be just like second except that now raised reward to ten thousand guinea also included fact that child have be received at birmingham station by indian ayah advertisement caused searchings of heart in house where there have be at time indian ayah suggestion in one of house be that child have died have be substituted matter be discussed in servant hall at lady woodroffe butler have be in service with sir humphrey household for thirty year came home said from india with sir humphrey came to house lady ayah died six seven year ago be already here with child now sir humphrey did know child again know child 'd know sir humphrey child anywhere why saw day till be six month old lovely child be with light hair blue eye did lady come from birmingham what must lady be doing at birmingham came straight through from scotland from noble pa lord dunedin ayah told so page who be listening resigned with sigh prospect of getting reward of ten thousand guinea lady woodroffe upstairs read third advertisement grew faint sick with fear sir robert read advertisement very good said very good indeed if there have be one who knew anything at there must have be answer to offer of two thousand pound let offer million if like dick said molly seemed very clever at first see nothing have come of on contrary something have come of mind whole world be talking about case if be genuine adoption unknown woman must certainly have come forward why because there must be reason for concealment a be remains silent why because there have be substitution instead of adoption have put forward baby in place in name of dead child how can prove know molly believe have missed vocation be sleuth hound give clue put on scent let rip face hardened feature grew sharper eye keener bent neck forward be no longer musician be bloodhound looking for scent acting instinct in made while spoke adapt face expression to new part played to look part be if consider essential chapter xv two jump conclusion advertisement produced answer except from person hoping to make money by case such a railway porter who must swear to baby lady who be really mother detective who wanted good long staying job there seemed hope help from advertisement well then what next by time richard woodroffe though never before engaged upon kind of business found so much interested in subject that must think of nothing else occupied with putting case into statement kept altering carried back in imagination to transference of baby saw doctor taking from mother giving to ayah in railway station there stopped friend sir robert be doctor friend sir robert who knew theatrical show folk a well a royal prince duke illustrious folk well knew physician well enough to be certain that secret be a safe behind steady deep set eye a with father confessor square chin did not belong to garrulous temper big brain be treasury of family secret knew where skeleton be kept be only one of thousand secret patient told everything be of course because be specialist in nervous disorder have good deal to do with family personal secret fortunately personal secret be not family secret there be deep seated prejudice against upper ten thousand in matter of family secret be supposed to posse large number of awkward chronicle be supposed to be scandal aristocratic circle be supposed to be very much exposed to danger of catching family secret disease be contagious be passed on from one family to with surprising readiness be supposed also to be continually engaged in hushing up hiding away sending accomplice servant cognizant of certain transaction to america antipode even dropping into dungeon be believed to be always trying to forget last scandal one while be destroying proof of last scandal for own part while admitting contagion of disorder must submit that earl be more liable to than alderman baron no more than butcher middle class family be always either going up going down with be going up there be immense quantity of thing to be forgotten wipe out with sponge deplorable great aunt look other way when pas grave agree to forget whole family of cousin wish to be remembered more than say thirty year back desire that inquiry other than general will be made into origin in word if may compress so great discovery in single sentence middle class great middle class backbone leg brain tongue a know of country class to nearly belong be really home haunt of family secret secret however be not in ordinary run not excitable actress pour into ear of physician moreover if theory be true be secret richard reflected a much of doctor a of lady again since adoption became substitution although young doctor may have assisted in former old doctor might not be anxious for story to get about now that meant latter here however be fact a related by alice unknown lady according to doctor statement called upon stated that be anxious to adopt child in place of own have just lost by death be early in february lady stated further that wanted child about fifteen month of age light haired blue eyed child adopted be thirteen month of age did child die in birmingham a lady be apparently passing through did child die at hotel dr steele called upon alice then in great poverty distress asked if must let child be adopted whether must suffer to go into workhouse chose former alternative accepted sum of fifty pound for child money be paid in five pound note did not know number there be mark on child by might be identified on child clothes before giving up mother pinned paper giving christian name humphrey be son of anthony woodroffe in woodroffe family there be always humphrey nothing else nothing else clue suggestion hint opening anywhere except resemblance strange likeness of young man humphrey to haunted dick looked at in glass one must see that feature hair eye be of humphrey difference there be in stature in expression in carriage dick be a elastic springy a other be measured slow of gait a for other resemblance said by alice to be even more marked that between humphrey anthony woodroffe actor john anthony be even more remarkable resemblance one may look for in son in brother not in cousin separated by five hundred year point kept to be resemblance found in humphrey to alice mother by theory be not same kind of resemblance a other feature face head be different be that resemblance reminds resemblance not defined in word unmistakable day long night dick saw resemblance put down point strongest possible resemblance so stated by mother of adopted child of son to father strong resemblance a between brother son of same father resemblance be fancy of own a between mother son lady who adopted boy must have belonged to indian family because there be ayah with age of child adopted corresponded very nearly with age of sir humphrey went to british museum consulted debrett took trouble to go there because did not posse volume none of friend have ever heard of there read a doctor have read few week before that present holder of woodroffe baronetcy be humphrey arundale second baronet son of late sir humphrey etc born on december nd there be nothing much to be got out of little paragraph a dick read again again letter began to shift be astonishing how letter can by little shifting convey very different meaning be what read now woodroffe humphrey falsely calling second baronet son of late sir humphrey really son of one john anthony woodroffe distant cousin of sir humphrey vocalist comedian vagabond by alice daughter of tom dick harry pennefather engaged in small trade of hackney born in sold by mother in february through agency of sir robert steele md fr ex president of royal college of physician now of harley street to lilias lady woodroffe daughter of earl of dunedin who passed off a own child collateral branch richard son of late john anthony woodroffe by bethia second wife after have divorced deserted above mentioned alice october unmarried have club musician singer comedian vagabond put back volume be very remarkable red book said nobody know how get at fact now for part seem able to get at truth however much try there 'debrett have in print for world to read then looked up same work twelve year before found under name of woodroffe fact that sir elder retired from active service returned to england early in february old man came home then said at very time when adoption be negotiated at very time how doe that bear on case well if own child died there be perhaps time to get to take place before got home now dick in small way be story teller be in request by who knew because told story very well also because told very few must only work when must capture idea when story came of own accord be author of one two comediettas further have be on stage have played many part from variegated experience understood value of drawing conclusion first putting together proof afterwards perhaps proof might fail to arrive conclusion must remain geometry want to build up proof arrive at conclusion one must not otherwise guess who must possibly imagine that square on side opposite right angle be equal to sum of square on side containing right angle not even sharpest woman ever created must arrive at conclusion without proof in law also chiefly because men be mostly liar exact proof be demanded proof arrived at by painfully picking truth out of lie young man for part partly because be story teller dramatist partly because be musician found best readiest method to jump at truth first to prove afterwards arrived at conclusion perfectly satisfied without reason like kangaroo by jump in fact took two jump be always great help in case requiring thought argument construction because good case be like story in requiring construction to consult feminine mind if be interested in owner tenant of certain mind make consultation better richard woodroffe consulted molly day by talking over case again again by looking at in company one becomes more critical at same time clearer in one view there be a know many reason why richard must consult young lady apart from undoubted intelligence why molly asked why put to feminine perception why be good lady so profoundly moved by mere sight of fellow be moved by sight of yet be exactly like believe be at theatre be in private box be one of line of johnny in stall be so much affected that have to leave house met again at steele dinner be affected in same way why be presumed never to have seen fellow before certainly have not seen for twenty four year why ask be so much affected tell that sight of always affect in exactly same way with same mysterious yearning longing with sadness indescribable wait minute hear out be resemblance to certain man first husband again be like doe not yearn after bit what can be except unknown sense maternal instinct be awakened in what be own identity alone can understand with child dick said molly be tremendous jump yet of course of course knew must agree with intuition conclusion insight of woman be beyond everything molly be blessed thing that be retained in case sight of be to daily refresher look of be heavy fee voice of be encouragement stand by molly will pull half brother of mine down from bad eminence ask when stand beside with entirely new most distinguished company of cousin how feel have become of superiority will introduce to pew opener will present to draper again there be second jump ask that molly do imagine that doctor be really truly a ignorant a must have believe of lady name know lady woodroffe asks son to dinner to be sure know world if attended dead child of course must have known name suppose did not if so since lady came to immediately after death might have consulted register to find what child of age have died during certain week in birmingham if child did die there of be not certain even in great city like birmingham there be not many child of age dying day very few dying in hotel very few child indeed belonging to visitor stranger molly mine if doctor did not know doctor might have known be that so deny if can suppose so dick though really see what be driving at very well then go on why did doctor go out of way to invite humphrey to meet true mother now know dr steele be awfully good fellow charitable good natured will do anything for man be man of science be always watching thinking putting thing together have heard talk about heredity what man get from ancestor now be quite certain molly without proof want proof hang hard fast matter of fact evidence be quite certain say that steele invited humphrey mother in order to look at watch difference likeness see case may be beautiful illustration of hereditary quality here be young man separated from own people from infancy there can be imitation now after twenty year more man of science can contemplate son brought up in most aristocratic superior atmosphere mother who have always remained in much same condition except for money son who have be brought up like father vagabond wanderer with fiddle be lovely chance for saw looking at dinner time in evening when be playing saw under bushy eyebrow looking from humphrey to mother wondered why now know doctor molly be accomplice accomplice oh man in position accomplice after act not before theory be dr steele met lady after came to town how managed to raise from cheap general practitioner to leading london physician one doe know be like stepping from thirty shilling week to being star at fifty pound one know how be done do think lady woodroffe be useful in talking about if wrote story must make doctor dog lady footstep coerce into advancing be story however take that met recognized that agreed that nothing be to be said about little transaction of past then of course when alice turned up unexpectedly asked where child be to be seen there be nothing to do except to hold up hand protest that knew nothing about child be guess work dick yes be afraid have nothing before guess work unless get fact to go upon look here woman be standing on one side of high wall woman be on other side of wall there be door in wall sir robert keep key of door in pocket there be only one key have unless consent to unlock door two woman can never meet so half brother will remain upon eminence fell into gloomy silence dick broke molly what about good friend mother of interesting changeling be strangely comforted by reflection that matter be in hand dick have found favour in sight in husband good so far be firmly persuaded that will bring truth to light still cling to dream know doe talk about humphrey be taken with say little lie down shuts eye then be thinking of like to play so that may think about when drive out be sure be looking for in crowd if be to call must tell everything be certain that dream of heaping upon that young man can possibly desire a soon a get back hope poor soul will not meet with disappointment fear molly fear relapsed into gloomy silence hold two end of chain in hand can not connect end might go to steele show what suspect must only laugh at laugh like sphynx sometimes if went to lady woodroffe must be handed over to solicitor by conducted to high court of justice must hear plain speaking from judge on subject of defamation of character everybody must believe be black mailer must be called upon to pay large sum of money a damage must have to go through court of bankruptcy mind of inquirer have never before be exercised upon matter more knotty than presentation of simple plot difficulty of getting people off stage sometimes in moment of depression even doubted own conclusion condition of mind fatal to discovery because be quite certain that eye of faith first perceives what slow piecing together of fact afterwards prof must perceive truth somehow first before can prove perhaps be not truth be at first discerned in case seeker after truth have at least imaginary object by to direct step may lead wrong on other hand may help to recover clue will lead straight to heart of thing in word one want theory to assist research in thing of science in thing of practice dick said molly about register what about why that doctor might have found name of child by simply looking into register if child be to say died in birmingham yes if died in birmingham well then dick if doctor must search register stopped for moment always do on stage to heighten effect well molly why ca dick sat down suddenly knocked over by shock of suggestion good heaven molly oh depth height spring leap of woman wit why ca why ca molly be log lump lout deserve that must take half brother not that good bye good bye incomparable shepherdess raised hand kissed fly hasten on wing of wind to birmingham city of hidden truth to read revelation of register chapter xvi wretch hilarie sat alone in deep

say be classical way of putting tell that expressive face mine can screw up be pulled out like indiarubber face tall figure fairly good voice be wanted first of have three will see directly that poor dick be not quite disinterested person still may be right must say that if be to go on stage must rather make laugh than cry must be much more pleasant to broaden face with smile than to stiffen with terror at sight of blood stained dagger stage seems only profession open to girl like if be to have profession at will understand directly be no longer absolutely necessary be born behind footlights dick be born in sawdust so there seems natural fitness however until knew acquaintance be folk have never learned to think of a belonging to world at to young imagination world consisted of great many people whose only occupation be to scrape money together in order to buy seat at theatre made thing painted thing built thing contrived thing wrote thing be extremely industrious because industry brought ticket shop imagined be only established furnished for purpose of providing thing wanted by show folk have never in fact got rid of feeling show be everything world existed only to be

be born on day propose to call upon to morrow afternoon at about three o'clock in hope of obtaining interview with on subject remain madam obedient servant richard woodroffe now understand why richard woodroffe came to town in so buoyant jubilant mood saw received with shame confusion by fallen enemy saw playing for first time in life part requiring great dignity of conqueror must be chivalrous towards sinner must utter reproach to lay proof before to receive surrender must be enough richard be not revengeful person wrong forgot injury forgave at same time must have be more than human if have not contemplated with kind of satisfaction reduction of second baronet to true level must leave with more pride more superiority ala be not prepared for what awaited have asked what kind of woman must meet must have imagined person broken down by discovery of guilt throwing at foot ready to confess everything woman with whom must be conqueror that table must be turned upon never even thought possible who must have discovered that real heir to name title of sir humphrey woodroffe have actually died at birmingham twenty four year ago who then be present so called sir humphrey thou art woman ala ala be woman be pretty dialogue of conquest confession fondly imagined what happened at hour of three called sent in card be taken upstairs to drawing room where lady of august presence severe aspect who struck unexpected terror into at outset be sitting at table with secretary severe person put up glass curiously icily motioned to wait while went on dictating to secretary when have finished took several minute dismissed assistant turned to visitor who be still standing hat in hand already disconcerted by contemptuous treatment expectant of unpleasantness pushed back chair took paper from table sent letter yesterday mr woodroffe did said huskily then with feeling of being cross examined cleared throat tried to assume attitude of dignity be letter believe read to make sure be letter oh be come suppose to talk over matter to see what can make out of well sir have taken advice upon letter be advised to have door shut in face be advised to send to lawyer be not afraid even of black mailer resolved to see now sir may sit down if like richard sank into chair cheek flaming go on then added impatiently waste time explain letter sir instantly rapped table sharply with paper knife triumphant detective jumped can can explain poor young man felt confidence slipping away from for looked a if be actually going to brazen out contingency have not occurred to one moment mr woodroffe be more inclined to give opportunity to explain personally because hear that son have already met can hardly say made acquaintance met that be pretend to be matter nothing distant cousin of now sir having said so much be prepared to listen can give whole story lady woodroffe whole story whole story mean call thing by right name go on occupy time needlessly be tedious will do assure plucked up courage thinking of proof not much even think will interest first of then father who be comedian playing under name of anthony be christian name married a first wife london girl father be not man of principle be sorry to say after time deserted wife left alone with child in street of birmingham birmingham repeated lady woodroffe winced might have be fancy certainly seemed to wince at mention of great city sat upright with hand crossed face be pale eye be hard though still smiled go on sir said left wife in birmingham dare say will understand presently what mean be twenty four twenty five year ago deserted wife must not believe that have lost affection knew that child presence annoyed that fact perhaps influenced there be also certainty of workhouse before for child be therefore easily persuaded to consent to arrangement by mean of doctor of place to give child into charge of lady who have lost own be willing to adopt did in ignorance of lady name did never learn lady name question be mistake lady woodroffe perceived mistake set lip tighter never have mean of finding out went after husband followed from place to place till finally caught in town of western state here a soon a appeared on scene divorced for alleged incompatibility of temper afterwards married again be son of second marriage yes be doubt interesting story be not really interested in pedigree sighed oh do go on man why do come here with be beginning of story end with letter of mine promised mr woodroffe smiled icily eye remained hard that must neither bore waste time be sure that be keeping word quite sure go back to story concluded from story a be told that lady child have died in birmingham in hotel probably one moment may guess that object be apparently to find person who bought took charge of child be on behalf of mother who be now in england above thing desire to find child be natural be not perfectly natural let hope that may succeed now go on mr woodroffe of course woman who must sell child doe not deserve to get back again perhaps last remark be also mistake at least showed temper perhaps not woman mr haveril however who be married to extremely wealthy american haveril can be millionaire person whom son met with at sir robert steele house be lady indeed always tell son that must be more careful of company well go on richard smiled insolence of observation did not hurt in least lessened power of presence gave confidence lady continued fancy discerns extraordinary resemblance to husband father to myself in son lady woodroffe resemblance be very striking have most undoubtedly father face same colour of hair figure even more strongly be said than yet be considered like because there be resemblance imagined hardly imagined dreamed dreamed what have to do with dream well have only to ascertain real parentage of sir humphrey son oh have letter in mind sir humphrey said second baronet will come to letter presently one must think have other reason to go upon besides resemblance by time be evident that understood exactly what be meant have until yesterday other reason yet from one two simple fact have discovered be in letter be certain that be right indeed do understand mr woodroffe exact meaning of word be right ' then what be son must be no longer son must be son then what be lady woodroffe be not for to say promised to give audience therefore go on since there be kind of proof of imagining dream thought must go down to birmingham to search register be detective private secret inquirer be acting only for lady be millionairess hope pay well fact fact found great deal more than hoped fact set forth in letter entry in register purporting to record death of son entry in hotel book giving name be be not enough child be about same age a one adopted there be not many child of age who die week even in birmingham again if child died in birmingham at must have be at hotel there be not many child of same age likely to die in same week in birmingham hotel have register of death searched found what told copy have be taken went to hotel nearest station have visitor book searched found what told copy have be taken very good what next sent that letter came to hear what say about must say about who be young man who call second baronet be son then who be child died how be to tell must ask one else who be lady woodroffe who came to hotel how do know must ask one else oh might have considered attitude a possible at least have not face expressed bewilderment surprise actually suggest to to of people in world actually woman of position bought child in place of dead child be meaning be not sir certainly be answered with creditable valour know did there be way out of to confess why miserable little counter jumper dick stepped back in alarm because looked a if be going to box ear be quite capable of indeed for guilty conscience held back must have done a be wrath be not feigned maddened to think that man must so easily discover whole half of thing thought concealed for ever wretched little counter jumper repeated with reginal gesture tall commanding taller than poor richard dear how much more commanding pretend trumpery resemblance why son be foot taller than son father be gentleman face manner show yours face manner show what be leave house sir dick dropped hat in surprise if think to black mail be mistaken leave house if dare to speak of again will be to lawyer richard picked up hat action be trifle completed discomfiture stay moment understand quite clearly that can make use of entry that please may a well understand have never be in birmingham in life that person in position act move among surrounding troop of servant to speak nothing of friend relation that heir of person like sir humphrey die get buried unknown to friend perhaps have not thought of heard statement with open mouth be struck dumb understand at once make principal who be rich person understand have never be in birmingham in life that hour of life can be accounted for who be that child then find out if can have nothing to do with if twenty year ago woman chose for purpose of own to personate wife of sir humphrey who be then in scotland while sir humphrey be on way home from india do think be going to inquire trouble head about impudence richard murmured something indistinct did not know what to say how must majestic woman have done thing yet who else must have done lady woodroffe sat down again have be wrong said in getting angry over matter perhaps be not after black mailer indeed be not have heard son said in softer voice speak of mr woodroffe must warn that attempt to bring charge will be met by solicitor one word more miss hilarie woodroffe have also believe taken interest in must suggest mr woodroffe that must be foolish to throw away only respectable connection posse in wild goose chase can lead to nothing except ignoble pay from woman who by own confession threw away own child sold to stranger now can go sir did not ring bell for servant pointed turned back to desk have goodness to shut door behind be with greatly lowered spirit richard walked down stair out of door chapter xviii gracious lady once removed from presence of great lady overwhelming authority of manner voice face richard began to consider situation over again lady denied knowledge of fact might have expected why how must such woman in position face world confess to having committed so great crime ought to have known that be impossible so cursed for as steadied nerve with reflection that have done thing might say considered that people can always be found to believe great solid shameless liar remarked with humiliation on very first occasion in life when wanted dignity to meet dignity authority to meet authority have come to grief serious comedy however by way of consolation be not line in evening after dinner repaired to hotel not with triumphal step have promised molly be reading letter aloud to alice dick cried perhaps can explain what mean have just arrived dear madam have have interview with certain mr richard woodroffe who call distant cousin of son brought strange story of strange delusion seemed to consider supported by certain discovery of entry in register of birth death can not believe allegation without further evidence because be so extremely improbable on face of one must say impossible can not understand even if rest on strongest evidence have however forwarded case to solicitor who will probably communicate with mr woodroffe with personally desire further speech circumstance of case a first placed before naturally awaken woman sympathy mother bereaved of son be at time object of pity even when bereavement be not due to common cause to own conduct conduct not such a can be readily excused story person brought be to effect that have seen son at theatre that afterwards met at house of sir robert steele that observed imagined certain point of resemblance with own first husband certain others with man richard woodroffe certainly did not occur to when called that must claim honour of most distant resemblance to son however learned from that have jumped to wonderful conclusion that be actually none other than son whom lost not by death by sale that sold child in fact for what must fetch a farmer body sell pig venture to pronounce judgment upon for act temptation be doubtless great subsequent distress be perhaps greater than if have lost child by act of god write to only concerning strange delusion apart from imaginary resemblance on delusion be founded adviser mr richard woodroffe have discovered tell entry to have already referred in register of death at birmingham state say that on certain day there died in place one humphrey son of sir humphrey woodroffe on day a find by reference to diary to certain letter have be preserved be staying with father lord dunedin at country seat in scotland child then infant who be born at poonah in india be with few day later travelled south to london in order to meet sir humphrey who be returning from india of course boy came with be not business to inquire to explain why entry be made in register why be thought by one desirable that dead child must be entered under false name that child must have be sir humphrey be unlikely first because have be in india for ten year before return next because be man of perfectly blameless life observe if please that fact can be proved father still life date can be easily established even a regard resemblance can be shown that child be be strikingly like father of same height same hair same eye when delusion of kind seizes brain be likely to remain there to become stronger deeper more difficult to remove a year go on have therefore thought best to invite to meet can then talk over matter quietly will perhaps be able to make understand baseless nature of belief need hardly say must feel necessary in case of persisting in claim be if propose advancing claim seriously to defend honour with utmost vigour in court of law exists can not of course be ignorant of fact that more than loss of child be concerned there be loss of good name because must have world to believe that woman born of most honourable god fearing parent married to man of highest reputation herself of good reputation must stoop so low one can hardly write a to buy baby of woman have never seen of poor woman of woman of whom knew nothing except be deserted wife of strolling actor to pas child off upon husband world a own say more by letter perhaps have spoken uselessly in case word must give place to act however will confer with if wish personally come here to morrow afternoon about five will try to discus subject calmly without prejudice of foregone conclusion in offering opportunity consider own happiness only for own part matter very little what one chooses to believe a to son there be always within reach law if injurious charge statement be made against character there be law for use if wish to recover what think be own remain dear madam very faithfully yours lilias woodroffe what be meaning of letter dick molly repeated what be entry that talk about molly thought be coming home with discovery be clincher believe have gone muddled thing well tell told what more do want asked molly child died be hers so believe be sure remember how took lie pretence rage be wrath of innocent woman molly be wrath of woman found out driven to bay be sure of then what doe mean by letter be reply mean defiance ought to go then know think be wrong to go may make right for alice to go alice did go took molly with because wanted support went filled with doubt woman letter be confident braggart there be discovery of child death there be resemblance came away a will see in certainty yet more in doubt than before found in room in not only refinement may be purchased of artistic decorator be visible refinement can only be acquired by many generation of wealth position good breeding book picture curtain carpet furniture bore witness to fact that tenant be gentlewoman anglo american born brought up in poverty of london clerkery accustomed to bare surroundings of poverty in western state able to command after many year to enjoy flaunting luxury of modern hotel felt with sense of sinking that son if be son must have be brought up with social advantage must never have given on table lay small bundle tied up with towel curiously out of place simple bundle looked among thing beautiful precious of drawing room know how little matter will sometimes revive old recollection what have parcel wrapped in towel to do with time twenty four year ago when mother broken hearted laid child in arm of doctor who carried into railway station yet be reminded of moment that special moment in history of bereavement to be sure mind of woman be easily turned to subject possessed must think of nothing else except when molly came to talk sing to door be opened lady came in be not dressed in nearly so costly manner a visitor appearance impressed be great lady in manner in appearance be also gracious though speaker on platform advocate of many cause be still feminine dignified produced effect desired without apparent effort carried in hand bundle of letter paper bowed to visitor be very good of said to come if will excuse one minute sat down touched hand bell be answered by young lady be letter said lady woodroffe have indicated reply can let have at six then turned to alice again will forgive busy woman be sure said be for moment greatly occupied with rescue work of kind be beautiful thing to snatch even one poor woman from life of crime one may observe that received alice a have received richard with great show of important philanthropic work effect produced be not quite same because alice be thinking of something else to molly be only good play acting be not in least impressed by presence authority only considered that business be well done lady woodroffe finished now said smiling sweetly will begin to talk have brought cousin miss pennefather said alice know why be here oh yes lady woodroffe recognized molly presence with inclination asserts higher place will take tea first be disappointed in appearance of woman who claimed son one expects of woman who must sell baby face of brass eye of bronze one expects vulgarity in highly pronounced form perhaps with ostrich feather came in expectant of battle with red faced over dressed female found woman dressed quietly yet in costly stuff pale face delicate feature sign of commoner form of vulgarity woman of apparent refinement of course know that person may be refined yet not gentlewoman many there be who take comfort in reflection rang bell for tea began to talk be very good of to come began tell have be long in old country do find altered since left so long ago believe be not american by birth have child do soon return to state went on without paying much attention to mr haveril reply hear that husband be millionaire will soon begin to think that american be millionaire must be strange to have unlimited command of money be sure will do great deal of good with sense of responsibility when there be so much waiting to be done must be overwhelming here in country be so poor so very poor have country house know be very fine house of park garden then see house garden cost so much to keep up farm remain unlet however here be tea then plunged into subject dear lady began do assure that feel for be most extraordinary case have ever heard of believe if remember right there be account of woman in branger autobiography who have made baby foundling spent rest of life in looking for became mad in consequence do let implore not to begin looking for boy case be hopeless will never succeed will only make rest of life miserable be quite impossible that must ever find if did find be utterly impossible that must be able to prove that be child will assure heap disappointment misery upon head alice said nothing lady woodroffe glanced at molly be looking straight before apparently quite unmoved now let argue point calmly quietly see resemblance jump to conclusion now first a regard resemblance there be very remarkable family resemblance among many of woodroffes three cousin at least miss hilarie woodroffe whom know perhaps son mr richard woodroffe who appears to be play actor of kind claim kinship after five hundred year five hundred year met by accident in old church of family made acquaintance young men curiously resemble young lady be only face said alice be voice eye manner husband have most beautiful manner when chose on stage believe learn to assume kind of manner supposed to be of society when choose son however always chooses to have beautiful manner must be sure will admit take into account difference a well a resemblance for instance gather from whole history that husband be in respect especially most wife sense of wrong what call wretch disgraceful person be deserted divorced married american actress deserted richard woodroffe be second son son be quite reverse be young man of highest principle of perfectly blameless character molly smiled looking straight before again husband believe be low comedian singer dancer buffoon anything be general utility actor sometimes have variety entertainment humphrey son have talent for acting at like father must conceive beneath dignity of gentleman to make merriment for friend alice sighed molly sat looking straight before unmoved unconcerned point be husband bookish man be not never opened book son be essentially studious especially in history of art molly smiled again said nothing to call humphrey studious be perhaps stretching truth there certainly be row of french novel now dear madam will ask to set point down side by side be to say on one side resemblance in face real imaginary on other side dignity good breeding hereditary breeding constitutional gravity of carriage studious habit ambition total absence of acting faculty ask of quality must inherit from husband a be here alone must ask of quality must inherit from paused for reply there be none alice looked at molly sighed molly smiled looked straight before say thing offensively lady woodroffe continued in soft persuasive accent sole desire be to send away convinced that son can not possibly can not under possibility under imaginable possibility be son to return to point of difference will ask one more question be husband man of unselfish habit even temper be not lady woodroffe smiled be sorry to hear for sake son on other hand be absolutely unselfish always sweet tempered looked sharply at girl why did smile what did mean what did know about humphrey however lady woodroffe went on still bland gracious delude longer madam for sake of own peace quiet put away from oh dreadful delusion will posse more more will yearn more more for possession of son have lost mind will become so filled with delusion that will be able to think about nothing else will drive to desperate act will poison daily life will turn wealth into heavy burden implore for sake of love to abandon baseless belief oh if only knew if only knew tear rose to eye of woman who sought son after year thought have found again recognized at theatre at doctor dinner poor dear lady again lady woodroffe took hand soothed be indeed strange that must find such resemblance a told see how impossible be to find anything out nevertheless if can be of help to will willingly do can only advice be that let bygone sleep remain contented with wonderful gift heaven have poured into lap to desire more be surely sin must give to first beggar in street if must only get back boy will suppose lady woodroffe got up stood before fireplace looking down upon visitor who be now trembling tearful will suppose say that take step hardly know what step can take must go to lawyer perhaps must go to son perhaps in case evidence will be examined on side fancied resemblance why pointed to portrait on wall be husband at age of thirty whose eye whose face whose hair do see in portrait be be not like son there really be strong resemblance lady woodroffe however did not explain that have copied from early portrait perhaps with addition slight alteration portrait alone will meet case besides chance resemblance again what be alice shook head sadly be shaken in faith next find entry in register who made that entry know why can not tell yet mr woodroffe say never mind mr woodroffe listen to what say then come forward tell very disgraceful story of how sold own child own boy oh terrible shameful story who be child died molly put word for first time who be that child can not tell one for purpose unknown chose to represent dead child a husband child say choose to offer explanation of personation will tell however how mr woodroffe explains know already waited for reply there be none supposes that child be child supposes next that person who bought child be be what call certainty who be child then molly repeated even supposing that own child died at birmingham be absolutely false how will connect dead child mother with transaction followed know alice looked to molly for support found none molly sat with cold impassive face when have made quite clear that sold child have then to fix crime upon a well how will do for have letter showing where be date prove must not be in birmingham at time prove also be at father house in scotland with boy now what have got to say want son find son replied with touch of temper will be proud indeed of mother when do find alice shuddered can hing to get delusion out of mind then want son woman face be obstinate have left off cry shaking eye be fierce pale face be set meant fighting interview have be failure who be child died molly question made clear plain again in moment of great serious importance think of little thing lady woodroffe saw in set serious face in line of mouth in determination of eye something reminded of humphrey must have asked woman what other quality apart from have enumerated might have inherited from be now certain that interview be failure persuasion soft word must prevail against certainty in woman mind want son repeated lady woodroffe turned to molly have heard everything said what be opinion miss did not catch name must find out who that child be dead child molly replied with tenacity then will talk more smiled again showed teeth then did boldest thing in power thing deliberately confessed truth bade defiance like bold stroke be stroke of genius yet like stroke of genius perhaps be mistake for have brought down very clothes in child have come to now showed to mother claimed for own be only going to delay one minute mr haveril be foolish thing perhaps be appeal to sentiment suppose that there be nothing woman treasure more than son baby clothes be going to

most trustworthy person picked out photograph of lady woodroffe from bundle of photograph remembered case lady perfectly well there be therefore doubt possible that have be in birmingham at time that have lost own son sir sat up in chair with angry eye be persecution have already given patient hearing to most impudent story have lady woodroffe angry look presence disconcerted now be so perfectly certain of cause of shameless falsehood that stood before at ease even with appearance of dignity even took trouble to invite friend person for whom profess to act woman with delusion did did not wait to be invited took chair sat down in in order to convince of absurdity in failed because after talk there remained solid fact death of sir humphrey son sir humphrey have one son only who be still living be wrong in thinking that plain statement of fact must move poor mad woman brought with young person who encouraged to insult even attempted to assault believe after grossest abuse carried off bundle of baby linen thing have treasured for reason fear be incapable of understanding lady woodroffe on contrary understand very well brought out on occasion with intention of showing poor lady what must venture to call defiance defiance certainly accept word defiance appear to be almost a polite a friend mr woodroffe must not have chosen more effective manner of announcing intention ' said 'these clothes made with own finger show that be boy yet will not have defy to prove that be ' be correct on one point do defy to prove that fact very well be here to day to tell have advanced one more step very important step be important not defy to prove fact be not however exactly acknowledgment will not argue with believe ought to hand over at once to lawyer to be dealt with for conspiracy richard woodroffe smiled wish must said must like nothing better than publicity of action oh groaned pertinacity of black mailer will not be insulted whatever say be here to tell that proof have now closed round so completely that there be not left verily believe single loophole of escape lady woodroffe rose with dignity talk to sir to of escape loophole go sir go to solicitor certainly richard continued however to occupy chair will go to solicitor whenever please must rather go to than come here for sake of others must prefer that must acknowledge fact let son go back to mother be own half brother be not fraternal affection that prompt in research assure if refuse to hear will have to go to solicitor through mr haveril solicitor oh go on then sat down again crossed hand in lap assuming something of expression of person bored to death by very bad sermon have certain evidence in hand then must not avoid smile of satisfaction connects with dead child child lady woodroffe caught breath started a if in sudden pain go on sir will tell what be arrived one evening at great midland hotel birmingham with indian ayah child engaged three room sitting room two bedroom explained that child have be taken suddenly alarmingly ill in train sent out for medical man came kept maid running about with hot water boy going out for remedy prescription stayed with night watching case in morning child be dead three day afterwards buried there be monument over child grave because made arrangement with help of dr robert steele substituted child for went away two three day after funeral disappeared room be taken in name book of hotel prove so much oh man be tedious tedious with repetition have be down to birmingham again have now found old waiter who remembers circumstance perfectly well indian ayah sick baby funeral say remembers that doubt have also found medical man who be called in not only remembers case entered at time in note book also remembers after four twenty year picked out of bundle of photograph think will admit that be important step made reply face be drawn twisted with pain of listening what be wanted now richard added be connection of yourself child if fail there will fail will ask sir robert will fail then will give publicity to case quite know how world will understand will have to explain world be high court of justice that must address will look to judge to protect remember be in power to prove be in scotland at very time on very day when child died on very day replied firmly without hesitation lady woodroffe can not believe what say can prove what like repeated can not prove bought child to speak plainly believe one word about proving alibi lady woodroffe more than believe that remarkably bold falsehood about child clothes will prove death of child beyond doubt can then if please find out something will amuse world about humphrey a for publicity since will only prove that woman took name care nothing reputation be not likely to be injured by such story who will believe against word that lady woodroffe leader sir in world of like know nothing world advance humanity world of religion of charity world combat vice unceasingly must condescend to crime so ignoble so purposeless be not concerned with credibility lady woodroffe learn that made large use of with mr haveril only desisted when proved failure then took to defiance publicity will fall upon fashionable physician great man of science head of profession who will have to acknowledge that found child bought for certain unknown person noble way for young physician to earn fee publicity will also fall upon now notorious lady who have got up in world since sold only child for fifty pound to keep out of workhouse injurious publicity will fall upon other than discovery of woman who once took name be identified by photograph forget that can after four twenty year can woman of age forty nine be identified by stranger with woman of twenty five thereabouts now mr richard woodroffe what else have got to say have only to say came here to day lady woodroffe in hope that what have told must show danger of position for sake of lady who be worn almost to death by anxiety of situation hoped that must confess confess to confess speak a if be common criminal said richard not common by mean lady woodroffe left chair stepped over to fireplace looked older authority went out of very strangely laid hand on shelf a if for support spoke slowly with show of anger slowly with sadness think sir do think that if must consider meaning of charge to person in position suffering inflict upon mischief may do to know not how many more by persisting in charge must abandon can not be acting for be playing game to win accuse of sordid motif want to win perhaps do have asked simple question whether be possible for to commit crime then to confess have to win game lady woodroffe think have won be not won yet believe sir will not be won unless choose can place in very awkward position anyhow mr richard woodroffe came here to make final appeal to be turn to make final appeal to be woman a perhaps know of very considerable importance in world charge a bring against must not only crush if be proved must dislocate ruin great many association institution of be very soul thousand of orphan working girl magdalen sinner must lose best friend be best friend tongue pen keep up stream flow in to relief be not possible for woman to think of thing there be boy be partly suppose what be by education partly by nature take away from position a gentleman of rank family send out disgraced to make own way in world will sink like lead call half brother well mr woodroffe be not young man of many virtue in fact have many vice can well believe if have seven devil now after disclosure will have seventy seven devil that also can well believe of course think about then mr woodroffe can not persuade that poor woman to go home to be content with what have seen have proved can not can not remind that sold child on condition that must never trouble about seek to know where might be living can not have seen son know who be want acknowledgment give know in fact what will happen afterwards lady woodroffe sat down sighed heavily be so said will go on will do worst richard woodroffe regarded with sense of pity even of respect woman have supported position by succession of shameless lie be now virtually confessing to that be lie have so much to lose great position among religious charitable people reputation respect blameless life great ability have won for thing be threatened madam said face full of emotion if be only son to be thought of must retire there be poor lady who be only kept alive believe by hope belief that son will be restored to believe if may speak of pity for pity sprang to foot with fire fury in cheek eye be happily rarest thing in world to see woman mean woman of culture overmastered by passion yet lie there be always possible in heart of meekest maiden most self governed most highly bred woman there lie tigress fish wife scold shrew formerly whenever woman be gathered together quarrelled whenever quarrelled fought sometimes with fist cudgel broom chair sometimes with tongue men be so horribly frightened by scolding wife that ducked put in cage carried round in cart little word pity be last drop in cup lady woodroffe raged stormed at unfortunate richard for time mind be beyond control afterwards remembered that fit of passion showed tension of mind made reply when torrent of word threat be exhausted threw into chair buried face in hand then richard quietly withdrew chapter xxiv horrid night richard woodroffe walked away with hanging head second time have learned that proof might not be so convincing after defence set up by woman of highest social position character personal influence that have never be in birmingham in life that on day of alleged death of child be in scotland that knew nothing of person who be said to have assumed name must only be met by evidence concerning that person by identification of person with lady woodroffe by old man speaking of event of four twenty year ago by alleged resemblance a to packet of clothes must certainly be evidence at be perfectly certain of fact there be doubt left in own mind must proof be accepted in court of justice a walked along with heavy reflection be startled by hand upon shoulder thing in former time caused sufferer to swoon with terror because be familiar greeting of sheriff officer man with writ that part of officer duty be now however gone be in fact hand of sir robert steele who day work finished be taking air dick cried have seen since since when since day when made study of heredity oh mean when dined with

satisfaction of world a soon a story be told for lawyer well there be one point lacking one point one point always that one point be like connecting family with illustrious ancestry always one point wanting need not ask what point be because be person who can supply link be that so asked doctor dryly then while be waiting for link dear richard advise to tie up paper go back to legitimate business stopped because be arrived at own door come in said now then dear boy sit down let have out first of however understand that can not establish that link say that be only person who can supply well if be so remember that will not mean will not just a like distinction between will will be sometimes too subtle for rule of syntax dear sir robert just consider what lot can prove lady woodroffe go to hotel in birmingham drive in hurriedly child be ill sends for medical man take two bedroom sitting room have ayah medical man stay with whole night in morning child dy how do know thing by note book of man who be called in by book of hotel by evidence of medical man by evidence of waiter who remembers case by register of death look strong admit so that can actually prove death of sir humphrey only son can call upon lady woodroffe to inform who be man calling sir humphrey only son prove that woman calling lady woodroffe did thing can produce witness who will swear to identity after year doubt if must if evidence must be received admit that have case a be must make cause clbre be able to make thing horribly uncomfortable for lady woodroffe be able to inspire young man son with lively animosity against mind that in least will go see will say 'you be half brother be first cousin to collection of common folk whose commonness will rejoice heart will introduce to will take tea with tea of shrimp periwinkle watercress that have yet to learn to love ' will exhaust in congratulation with domestic affection never interfere here however be difficulty say 'we ' will do who be 'we suppose spring upon world suppose nobody take notice may advertise whole history offer reward for discovery of identification of woman nobody can identify lady woodroffe old doctor old doctor must break down lady woodroffe have only to deny absolutely that be woman counsel can always suggest man in india woman assumption of name real wife with father lord dunedin letter to prove old nobleman swears

also humphrey father oh be sorry one need express sorrow on account a left mother when be baby have never seen did not know that be in england appears that have be sandwich man for time died in pauper infirmary a for feel neither shame grief be to a to stranger perhaps can use event in order to give publicity to story if must court publicity well let hope go on a for lady woodroffe have actually confessed thing then proceeded to tell story of child clothes doctor became thoughtful audacity of showing claiming clothes astonished be evidence dick said be complete proof to true mother perhaps to sir robert in fact admitted everything at stage mere admission of kind meant nothing be strange thing to do said doctor there be audacity of despair about have quite forgotten fact that register of death contained name of boy if have be common name must have mattered little did not tell that child died in birmingham that doctor what be name ah know doe know meaning bearing of evidence believe not will not talk however have undertaken to preserve absolute silence until be called upon to speak keep power of disclosure in own hand dick above thing do why did produce child clothes woman wit be hard to follow bey word against world meant believe a if must be believed on bare assertion against fact must be brought against be pride like female leader be incredibly proud mean to stand up deny on other hand situation be harassing there be point in case make almost impossible going on of ill conditioned brother suppose perhaps perhaps wish have told when how child died dined together over excellent bottle of chateau mouton exchanged further confidence dear dick said doctor be serious situation propose to cover woman of highest reputation with infamy say in effect 'you be quite right be infamous person prove ' want to restore to most amiable honourable woman son must break heart in year want to identify lady thereby to confess share in transaction might be made to look like complicity in fraud conspiracy told at time that looked like substitution though called adoption well can imitate lady frankness be to say in so many word confess truth show allow to conclude that
