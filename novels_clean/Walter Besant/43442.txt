be hoped thought that purpose included return home a soon a possible because be getting little tired street always street who be people who lived in must there be in house family life of mr dyson used to tell life have never seen promised must one day see sweet life where father mother child live together share joy sorrow began to look into window a walked along in hope of catching hasty glance at so much of family life a might be seen so early in morning passed one house where family be distinctly visible gathered together in front kitchen stopped looked down through iron railing child be seated at table mother be engaged in cooking operation at fire be about to sing hymn to have family prayer before breakfast not at house apparently for woman suddenly turned from occupation at fire without adequate motive that phillis must discern began boxing child ear round instantly there arose mighty cry from alike who have already be boxed who sat expectant of turn evidently be one of house where family life be not complete success scene jarred on phillis upsetting pretty little arcadian castle of domestic happiness felt disappointed hurried on after conductor be sad to relate caesar presently entered public house time phillis went in after with hesitation at encountered landlord in person who greeted dog asked what be doing so early then explained to miss fleming that be accustomed to call at house day about noon accompanied by two gentleman who have little whack then went away that only have to go through form of coming departing in order to get caesar out too little whack thought phillis little glass what lot of custom expression have to learn for interested in sagacity of dog in comparative psychology may be noted a remarkable thing that when caesar came out of second public house hesitated a one struck suddenly with grievous doubt have be doing right took few step in advance then looked round stopped then looked up down street finally came back to phillis asked for instruction with wistful gaze phillis turned round said home caesar then after barking twice caesar led way back again with alacrity renewed confidence not only led way home chose short cut known only to perhaps thought charge might be tired perhaps wished to show further variety of english life in district surrounding bloomsbury be court few know except policeman even that dauntless

court be therefore musical with sweet feminine voice child played together officer of london school board having yet ventured to face awful flower pot in continuous stream along central line of court phillis observed that same game be universal that player be apparently of same age also remarked few thing struck a worth noting language of men differed considerably from used by mr dyson pronunciation seemed to to lack delicacy difference most prominent at first be employment of single adjective to qualify everything observance so universal a to arrest at once attention of stranger woman be also apparent be engaged in singing together kind of chorus of lamentation in irregular strophe antistrophe on wicked way of men rough a be native of place one molested phillis men stared at exchanged criticism on personal appearance be complimentary although not poetically expressed woman stared harder said nothing until have passed by then made remark must have be unpleasant have be audible child alone took notice of immunity from insult belongs to young lady in english thoroughfare depends fear more upon force of public opinion than upon individual chivalry una must trust alone with lion can only trust among rough of london when be congregated in number think spectacle of goodness purity combined with beauty produce in rude breast by comparison with feeling of shame opening up way to repentance be expected by conscious maiden ministering in path of dorcas phillis walked along with steadfast eye watching everything afraid of nothing because knew of cause for fear dog decreasing distance between marched few foot in advance right through middle of child who fell back formed lane for to pas once phillis stopped to look at child great eyed soft faced curly haired beautiful boy spoke to asked name held out hand to father mother looked on watched for result must probably take form of coin boy prefaced reply with oath of great fulness rich flavour phillis have never heard phrase before sounded unmusically on ear then held out hand demanded copper watchful parent guardian on door step murmured approval child shouted together like men of ephesus at juncture caesar looked round mastered situation in moment surrounded isolated convoy by rapid movement almost simultaneous in flank rear barked angrily at child who threatened to close in en masse make short work of poor phillis gave clearly to understand once for be to follow with silent unquestioning docility obeyed came out of court into square phillis began to hope that tower of london must presently heave in sight at least silver thames with london bridge did not be very tired by time be nearly eight have be up out since five even vigorous young limb be beginning to feel dragged by three hour

other thing that young men in army be fond of be fond of reading too have considerable fund of information never excelled in anything phillis shook head mr dyson used to say that people like best be people who be in own line have acknowledged own inferiority to ourselves perhaps reason why mr colquhoun be liked be that did not compete with men who wished to excel contentedly took second place be one of bit of dysonian philosophy with phillis occasionally graced conversation quoting a reverently a if have be line from shakespeare sometimes with startling effect will try to like be past nineteen at twenty one will be own mistress if like will not live with longer after think will not in case live at mr colquhoun residence said joseph be sure will like fortnight to wait must not be

be not at afraid of stranger do look like being afraid drew up to full height smiled conscious superiority perhaps will think that rate too highly that said joseph with compliment really creditable for beginner must be difficult miss fleming when twin prepared to take morning walk at unexpected event happened caesar for first time on record for reason apparent assigned refused to accompany went out without feeling lonely unhappy little unprotected passed carnarvon arm without word at next halting place entered bar in silence glancing guiltily at other must be that passion for drink divested of usual trapping of pretence presented suddenly to brother in horrid ugliness came out with shame faced look returned home earlier than usual be perfectly sober separated without usual cheery

brought up delicately like not unhappily on same sound fundamental principle of oral teaching among loose odds end remained in mr dyson portfolio where lay joseph jagenal must ever find to help in completing great system of education be following scrap woman brought up with woman be hindered in perfect development let girl be separated from society of sex be educated mostly among men in way receptivity of feminine mind may be turned to best account in acquirement of robust masculine idea girl may become mother let therefore sit among men listen perhaps deprivation of society of own sex be greater loss to phillis than ignorance of reading consider what entailed grew up without most rudimentary notion of great art of flirtation have never even heard of looking out for establishment have idea of considering young man a possible husband have indeed glimmering not faintest streak of dawning twilight in matter of love while a for angling hooking big fish landing be better than heathen hottentot be most important loss there be others knew how to dress partly by instinct partly by looking at picture knew nothing about making up nature gave figure of hebe made loss insignificant to though be perhaps opinion of mr worth that there be figure so good art can improve not to know about making up be for woman to lose large part of useful sympathy for other woman again knew nothing of way in girl pour little confidence about trifle into other ear have not cultivated that intelligence girl can only learn from other enables to communicate volume with half lifted eyelid have man way of saying out what thought even so far a dogmatic training permitted of thinking for did not understand mystery with woman enwrap partly working on imagination of youth partly

be entirely free from great vice into woman of weaker nature be apt to fall be perfectly wholly truthful now be about to make acquaintance for first time with lady one of own sex of own station suppose phillis must have preserved characteristic instinct of womanhood despite extraordinary training because first thing observed be that visitor be dressed in style quite beyond power of conception imperfect taste so generalised from individual case jumped at notion that here be very superior woman indeed superiority be in young person at melton mowbray who designed dress that phillis did not know more remarkable point with mr cassilis phillis visitor than dress be face be so regular a to be faultless might have be modelled so have served for statue be also a cold a face of marble

a entered room saw tall beautiful girl with eye of deep brown who rose to greet with little timidity be taken by surprise expected to find rough rather vulgar young woman of style unformed manner saw before girl whose attitude spoke unmistakably of delicacy culture else miss fleming might be be clearly lady be immediately apparent mr cassilis be not likely to make mistake on point of such vital importance young lady of graceful figure most attractive face be more astonishing considering education perfectly dressed phillis in fact be attired in same simple morning costume in have taken early

girl be looking at river again in moonlight saw water glimmer in moonlight heard whisper of wave thought be long thought of child went up stream wondered through what meadow by hill stream have flowed then followed current down have to picture among ship before be lost in mighty ocean a looked there passed boat full of people be probably rough common people among be woman be singing phillis wondered who be woman have sweet voice a rowed by house one of men lit lantern light fell upon face making clear distinct for moment then be reflected in black water below two of be rowing boat sped

still phillis nature be pure gold of be quite certain with sincere people one always feel at ease be little awkward at first though perhaps awkwardness be chiefly mine because hardly knew what to talk about seemed a if between girl who can not read write there must be such great gulf that there must be nothing in common how conceited be over education lawrence be quite best informed girl know have perfectly wonderful memory repeat page of verse guardian taught by reading to talk french very well because have always have french maid play sings by ear draw like royal academician curious thing however be effect knowledge have have upon mind know what have be told nothing more consequently mind be light shade like moonlight landscape want atmosphere there be haze about did not at understand until knew phillis what very important part haze play in everyday life thought be governed by clear definite view of duty religion politics poor lawrence be in fog be only phillis who life in cloudless realm of pure conviction in politics be tory with distinct idea on necessity of hanging radical a for religion doe not concern cousin perhaps like most of class never think about religion at in case must not be interested in phillis doctrine took to church on sunday before service read hymn be to sing after have criticised word in manner peculiarly own read again knew hymn also told to do exactly a did in matter of uprising downsitting one two thing forgot in other one two made little mistake be usual lawrence a may remember for worshipper to pray in silence before sitting down phillis be looking about church therefore did not notice performance of duty also have forgotten to tell loud speech be forbidden by custom within wall of church therefore came upon with shock when phillis after looking round in quick eager way turned to said quite aloud 'this be curious place of be pretty be hideous ' be very true because church have half dozen style speech caused little consternation in place think beadle must have turned out have recovered presence of mind in time did not fortunately service began one must have behaved better during prayer than phillis knelt listening to word must have wished that intensity of attitude have not betrayed perfect absence of familiarity with church custom during psalm began by listening with little pleasure in face then looked little bored presently whispered to 'dear agatha really must go out if tune be not changed ' fortunately psalm be not long liked hymn made remark upon except one of choir boy be singing false that must like to take out of choir there then be quite true really feared that sense of duty might actually impel to take child by ear lead solemnly out of church during sermon regret to say that burst out laughing know phillis laugh pretty rippling laugh without malice in oh how rare sweet laugh be curate who be in pulpit very nice young man gentleman not must own intellectual hear be plucked repeatedly for degree stopped puzzled indignant then went on with discourse looked suppose so horrified that phillis saw have done wrong blushed there be more contretemps in church dear agatha explained when came out ' suppose ought not to have laughed really must not help did notice young gentleman in box be trying to act spoke word so badly just a if did not understand laughed without thinking be afraid be very rude of ' tried to explain thing to be difficult because sometimes quite know point of view next day curate called to vexation phillis apologised without blush went straight to point ' said ' laughed at yesterday in church be very sorry for ' be covered with confusion stammered something about sacred building 'but never be in church before ' went on 'that be very dreadful ' replied l'estrange do not think be very dreadful state for young lady then laughed again without apologising ber dyson used to say ' explained to 'that everybody church be in own heart never went to church did not consider in dreadful state at poor dear old man if can fall back on axiom of mr abraham dyson there be further argument possible curate went away have be here several time since be sure that be not attraction have have one two little afternoon on lawn be pretty to see phillis trying to take interest in young man listens to remark fail to strike answer question seem to bore in fact be much too feeble for have respect for cloth at very much fear that what be sport to be going to be death to of course lawrence may be quite sure that will not allow phillis to be compromised by attention of young man yet later on will ask view guardian must have be man of great culture have taught very well everything astonished curate yesterday by giving little historical essay on favourite laud understood very little of went away sorrowful must read in face determination to get up whole subject come back have out with phillis will not be dragged into argument if can prevent with young man

scull rested little looked at palm be blistering under rough exercise of rowing muttered something inaudible then seized oar again began to back out vigorously boat bow descended few inch then painter being taut moved more phillis leaned forward watching jack with look of rapturous delight damn ship said jack softly after three four minute strenuous backing swear at boat jack phillis broke in with

individuality a child doe in centre of universe made sun moon planet minor star revolve around partly unselfish because hovered about form of two three people loved took shape of devising mean of pleasing people partly artistic because beauty of june afternoon cried aloud for admiration while sunshine lay on lawn flower bed threw up light leaf blossom of passion flower on house side made darker shadow in gable while glorious river ran swiftly at foot river of never tired other thing lost novelty river never wish jack dunquerque be here said at last wish so too said agatha why did not

then laughed again because humphrey did exactly same a cornelius only with air of deprecation a one who must say never mind fame for present be embarrassing for mr l'estrange because must not for life recollect poet artist named jagenal men work be alike unknown to why did phillis laugh did pair before look so solemn about be solemn partly from vanity be cause of most of grave solemnity so much admire in world partly because finding face to face with phillis became suddenly painfully aware that have come on delicate errand cornelius looked furtively at humphrey artist glanced at poet found help from brother courage a evanescent a of mr robert acre be rapidly oozing out at boot phillis noted embarrassment tried to put at ease be difficult be so inordinately vain so self conscious so unused to anything beyond daily experience that be a awkward a pair of fantoccini people who live alone get into habit of thinking talking about twin be literally unable to think speak on other subject phillis saw to begin with be altered somehow looked older certainly more formidable be awkward to feel that be taking in manner under own protection before stranger why did laugh task discussed with such airy confidence over brandy soda assumed in presence of young lady dimension quite out of proportion to midnight estimate consideration made feel look ill at ease also be vexatious that of lady turned conversation upon subject nearest to man heart own work on contrary phillis asked after joseph sent invitation to come see mr l'estrange talked timidly about weather tried on opera on academy on last volume of browning be odd in so great artist a humphrey that have not yet seen academy in so great poet a cornelius that have not read recent poetry then tried to talk about flower two city bred artist knew wall flower from cabbage rose from sprig of asparagus be phillis must not help twin agatha so that former grew more helpless moment in fact girl be staring at wondering to feel how differently regarded men manner since first evening in carnarvon square when produced champagne in honour drank up remembered how have looked at with awe how after day two reverence vanished how found to be mere willow wind bag humbug regarded with contempt how made fun of with jack dunquerque how drew portrait now be mark of advanced education looked at with pity be so dependent on other

flower flattering asking how work got on congratulating on good look generally making thing comfortable for presently found on sloping bank of river where be wont to sit with jack cornelius jagenal alone be by side looked round saw humphrey standing before mr l'estrange occasionally glancing over shoulder noticed then curiously nervous motion of companion hand also that cheek be twitching with secret emotion looked older too thought perhaps be bright sunlight brought out dell valley crow foot round eye cleared voice with effort opened mouth to speak shut again silent be going to say mr

plead brother cause humphrey be younger let bear off winsome bride will be change in life said will allow to have share in happiness phillis made reply decidedly poet be gone distraught with overmuch reading thought cornelius smiling crowing laughing almost like child pressed hand left stepping with youthful elasticity across lawn humphrey sitting beside mr l'estrange be bewildering that good lady with dissertation on colour propos of flower held in hand agatha must not understand strange pair who looked so youthful until came to see closely then seemed to be of age pleased to name must understand talk be pedantic affected continually involved theory that speaker be next to brother greatest of living men if be awkward stupid sitting with humphrey on bench while discoursed on colour be still more awkward when other one appeared with countenance wreathed with smile sat on other side did there appear reason why one with beard must suddenly break off oration turn very red in face get up walk slowly across lawn to take brother place be what did cornelius took up running humphrey sat down beside phillis without speaking noticed in same characteristic of nervousness a in brother twice attempted to speak twice tongue clave to roof of mouth be going to tell that cornelius adores thought be instinct that be exactly what humphrey treacherous humphrey have determined on doing matrimony contemplated at close quarter in presence of enemy so to speak lost charm humphrey thought of pleasant life in carnarvon square determined at very last moment that if of be to marry must not

only of late breakfast to be taken a morning pick up so departed taking leave with multitudinous smile many tender hand pressure a left garden together arm in arm straightened back held up head stuck out leg like knave of spade looked so exactly like pair of triumphant cock phillis almost expected to crow au revoir said cornelius taking off hat with whole wreath of smile for final parting at gate
