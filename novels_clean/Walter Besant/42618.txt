conceived superstitious belief can call nothing superstition that who be perfectly well must be maintained in health although young people of age commonly contract disease above enumerated by drinking glass of water morning that old men who will catch at anything offer to restore health must resort to newly discovered universal medicine be not so strange captain crowle who to certain knowledge have never suffered day sickness in seventy year of life who kept teeth firm sound whose hair have not fallen off who stood firm on leg square in shoulder who still drank free devoured ration a eagerly a

morning finger became curly from continual clasp of guinea one be sure expected to find so grave dignified physician in town occupied mainly by rude tarpaulin lady where nothing better than mere apothecary must be expected there be found physician in manner in appearance equal to most fashionable doctor of medicine in london before breakfast madam repeated fasting if possible if be not convenient after breakfast think not to hasten operation of water by too generous use of seven ounce six drachm in weight let be daily allowance more for diet let be ample generous of best quality that market supply be providentially considering want of spa best market in norfolk provided with bird of kind wild of farmyard with beef mutton fattened on pasture of marshland with fruit other thing of very best partake plentifully madam deny tea may take if desire very good tea can be obtained of apothecary at guinea pound for own part allow beverage to be sometimes useful in clearing brain of

possibly be desired designed so great be mistrust of man have sometimes doubted whether whole affair be not contrived by dismiss suspicion however not because be in least degree unworthy of character because be unworthy of character of tom rising to carry off girl be not thought dishonourable especially a can always be made to appear that be with consent of girl to enter into conspiracy for

fitting punishment carriage with wounded man in went rattling along road jerk bump among rut being enough to keep wound open blood flowing then lord fylingdale called chairman who be asked do belong

marry in own class quill driver shopkeeper tarpauling a everybody know mr rising be gentleman of good family good estate must look higher ought to feel honoured at being carried away by gentleman a for rumour connecting with lord fylingdale one must be sorry for poor wench if be true because nothing must be more impossible yet ambition of girl ignorant of world may soar to height incredible like soap bubble only to burst sky rocket only to fall ignobly to ground be not likely that lordship said to be so fastidious must bestow serious thought upon girl save a representing town of lynn so on with whisper from one to other at morning prayer louder talk in pump room at confectioner in garden meantime captain made haste to wait upon lordship in order to thank more formally than in turmoil agitation of evening have be possible captain crowle said lordship there need thanks honour of spa of company be at stake must look on unmoved when crime be committed under very eye sir there be with

consideration molly make private marriage necessary must not consent to public wedding to wedding feast because rank forbids must be impossible for to invite person of own position to feast must be

with merchant skipper mate parson like then will be a lordship plea be at church at six said will provide everything see that everything be ready for be recognised a pas along street can wear domino with pink silk cloak wore other night at assembly then will recognise one else molly need be considered be sure that understand yes sighed understand then molly bowed low without offering to kiss wonderful lover left mistress be carried home in chair chapter xxx secret thing be told by molly in afternoon may very well believe that heart be sick sore to think of molly being thus thrown away for bribe of rank position upon man who seemed to be of marble of ice for of one thing concerning woman be very certain that to make happy must be loved at time must not know did suspect that noble earl be marrying molly for fortune like captain pictured a one lifted above common lot apart from temptation a regard money by own great possession why have nothing nothing at so much know have wasted dissipated whole there be nothing left marriage especially private hurried manner of be designed wholly to give possession control of molly rich to morrow then lose molly to morrow jack lordship

never might a well expect to forget day when be child together played about lady mount on wall rowed dingey in river forget own folk jack be monster nay molly want be to see happy remember if will remember that be captain mother faithful black daily praying for welfare so talked be agreed between that private wedding be under circumstance much more convenient than public one with display feasting in lord fylingdale must not take part must not think business too much hurried too secret a for other reason especially absence of settlement must protect wife have knowledge of such thing therefore suspicion bade farewell last time must see in private converse with a of old with tear kissed parted there be question of love of disappointment be like brother sister who be separated after growing up together so kissed said more than oh molly if have money must not lose replied with sigh more tear if have money jack must not have to leave own people go among stranger who will not welcome love give even friendliness left walked away be too downhearted to stay ashore must go aboard sit alone in captain cabin there be nothing so lonely a ship without crew if man in day desire to become hermit must take up quarter in one of old hulk lie in harbour deserted even by rat who swim away when provision be gone be lonely by day be ghostly by night for then old ship be visited by sailor who have sailed in have died in in ship there have be many who die of disease by accident fall overboard be drowned be visitor to hulk at night sailor know have seen wanted to be alone say therefore thought must go on board stay there now on way across market place there came running after man who called by name mr pentecrosse mr pentecrosse looking round saw that be lady anastasia footman in green gold livery very line person indeed to look at much finer than in workaday clothes sir said mistress lady anastasia desire speech with will kindly follow to lodging obeyed what did lady wish to say to be in parlour half dressed in what call believe dishabille nodded to footman who closed door left alone mr pentecrosse said graciously be second time have sent for yet gave permission to call upon often be politeness of sailor never mind forgive because molly love love molly madam replied be true that love molly have longer right to love except a one who must call if must brother so wanted mr pentecrosse may say jack to learn sentiment about affair be of course in confidence of lord fylingdale believe that know secret at least a many a man chooses to tell woman men have got secret cupboard lock door keep key say therefore rather most of lord secret what affair madam do mean remembered that business of betrothal be secret what affair why ask affair between lordship molly of course will prove to that know about can do better madam can tell what affair be oh jack act very badly never dear young man go upon stage of course know molly have secret from listen then on first night when molly distinguished yourselves in minuet never blush jack british sailor must always show that know fear lord fylingdale administered public rebuke to company for rudeness showed thereby that be already interested in girl then paid attention to old captain whose simplicity honesty be charming need not point out to jack that good old man became like wax in lordship hand even revealed ambition of finding alliance for girl with noble house sprig of quality attracted by report of fortune be also simple enough to imagine that young nobleman younger son who must take girl for money must need be miracle of virtue beyond consideration of money so far be quite correct believe ladyship be quite correct so far in fact captain ambition be common theme of ridicule in pump room in garden then came to see engaged a old friend one fully acquainted with quality virtue mean madam quality said to make friend of fair molly did showed amazing collection of jewel posse gave advice on certain point came here taught something of fashion in dress carriage behaviour be apt pupil lacking in respect for manner of polite world then find lord entering into further confidential discourse with captain even went on board ship be by escorted over whole vessel took so great interest in everything that be surprised at parting drank glass of wine to health of fair molly quite true suppose that captain have told molly who told lady anastasia very well see that know something there be great deal more at next assembly where molly went with having be dressed by own maid in better taste without barbaric splendour of so many gold chain precious stone lord fylingdale took out before lady norfolk lady being more than commonly observant of pedigree lineage danced first minuet with first of country dance what be ask open proclamation to world that be in love with girl daughter of town full of sailor so at least be interpreted hear by of company others out of sheer jealousy envy must not so acknowledge action be not so interpreted by captain by molly tut tut rapped finger smartly with fan what signifies opinion a if know anything of meaning of thing even when be done in broad daylight so to speak in presence of fashion in place why jack there be not girl in town who if honour have be done to must not have gone home evening to see in looking glass coronet already on head then came conclusion oh beautiful conclusion romantic conclusion when misguided young gentleman called tom rising endeavoured to carry off 't be gallant attempt must have succeeded doubt not madam with submission know not molly know own sex jack know that man be never liked le for showing courage however lord fylingdale took matter into own hand rode after fought unlucky tom brought back lady be still believe correct be quite correct madam so far a know next day lord fylingdale called at captain house to inquire after lady health saw captain saw lady who be none worse rather much better for excitement of adventure delightful sight of two gentleman trying to kill other for sake also saw lady mother who came out of kitchen red arm white with dough flour to receive noble lord lively sally only made more madly in love with girl how have learned can not tell lady of wealth can always believe find out thing servant know what go on lady anastasia continued narrative next day lord sent secretary mr semple a ambassador to captain be instructed to ask formally hand of captain ward in name of master did captain not being able to disguise joy pride at most unexpected honour now sir perceive that do know secret of young lady morning have again visited house received consent doubt be with disguised joy of lady have just come from have told of fine lover of engagement made reply will tell more lord desire private marriage marriage very soon have do surprise madam perceive that have told be quite right wedding a know be to be in st nicholas church to morrow morning at six before better sort have left bed in order not to be recognised by of people molly will wear domino pink silk cloak nodded head hid face with fan saying nothing for space when spoke voice be harsh be arrangement have understood perfectly well jack be very pretty business be not here be young man only thirty a yet with fine old title ancient name ancient estate who be bound by rule of order to marry only within own caste break rule marries girl who be not even gentlewoman who belongs to most homely folk possible what kind of happiness do think be likely to follow on marriage who be not altogether fool though be ignorant of way be right man to marry molly understands what like how think believe can never be happy with nobleman sailor man understand what mean to be great man nobleman in country from infancy heir must have what want must do a plea one be to check fine flow of spirit must believe that whole world be made for amusement that everything in world be made for to devour to destroy when child becomes man what can expect want friend because friendship among people like be based on mutual help want help companion must have young men like need never do kind of work consequently mind be never occupied have serious pursuit therefore of simple amusement soon tire can such man be unselfish can such man lead quiet domestic life will rake will gamble will drink there be nothing else for will form life if now then toss guinea to poor wretch be counted a act of highest charity most virtuous of nobleman may also be most profligate be what one be to think of lord fylingdale think what please jack must however hear that marriage be forbidden what must say forbidden marriage forbidden how why be to take place to morrow know answer question madam can not answer if be true that lord fylingdale be kind of gentleman whose character have drawn there be nothing must more rejoice to see if however may go jack may go dare say something be going to happen to morrow at six in morning at st nicholas church yes something will probably happen bride will be recognised by black domino pink silk cloak thank jack be very simple young man a simple a be honest woman can turn round finger went away wondering did not understand being a said so simple that have actually given information that desired have since learned that passion of jealousy nothing else filled soul inspired reading of lord fylingdale action in conduct at assembly saw beginning of passion own explanation that wanted to get money only made more jealous because although fully believed that statement saw way of getting at fortune without marrying girl a for visit to house suppose that simply caused to be watched followed while maid who played spy for must from certain point in road look into parlour when window be thrown open be easy for such jealous woman to surmise truth to jump at conclusion that in spite of protestation lord fylingdale have come to conclusion that must marry girl that rescue made grateful filled with admiration for courage that sent secretary to open business that followed up message by formal visit from when placed lady in chair at window bent over kissed hand be not all when told lady anastasia that have further occasion for service that have better go back to london at once jealousy flared up thus divined at once that be to be sent out of way so that when next met of business might have blown over might be le indignant at treatment of however something said be going to happen what must happen for own part be restless uneasy what must happen have known more about wrath of jealous woman must have be more uneasy something be going to happen must go to captain warn a to character of lover why knew nothing talk about heir to rank rich meant nothing except to show danger of position man so born so brought up must of necessity be more tempted than other men in direction of selfishness indulgence luxury laziness want of consideration for others be surely great misfortune to be born rich if one must only think so common lot be best with necessity of work molly misfortune came from money of hers father very wisely concealed from wife full extent of wealth so that remained in homely way captain also concealed from molly until grew up nature of fortune why must not conceal altogether from world then be useless to think what must have happened most of life be made up with mending trouble made by own sin own folly poor molly be about to suffer from father sin in having so much worldly wealth chapter xxxi society again

seemingly broad awake in sens who afterwards remembered nothing can even understand said man committing crime in unconscious manner who in sane moment must be incapable of wickedness be what be formerly called demoniac possession if so be truly dreadful thing one against ought to pray explanation seemed at least one accounted for strange denial of simple fact will leave so said will go talk

said be in evidence of mother nigra confess can not understand how without knowing must fail must possibly procure woman to personate have power of working miracle there be miracle here said except miracle of wickedness greater than must be thought possible patience molly sooner later will find out will be later fear there be three at least in plot clerk have be deceived sam semple have not be consulted be three lord fylingdale parson who be doubtless well paid for villainy woman whoever may be will find out truth through woman since marriage must give command of property jack since be ruined why doe make sign be week two after event suppose that lord fylingdale be making assured a to strength of position right however be not to wait very long be of opinion said vicar after many discussion on case thus drawn out that must lay fact before counsel learned in law ascertain position if be to contest claim in court have at least money to spend upon will spend said captain last penny upon meant last penny of ward fortune in a will hear be quite wrong because have now no power to spend of be therefore determined that vicar must undertake journey to london that father must accompany that must not only obtain advice opinion of lawyer that must ascertain through bookseller father cousin other person what must concerning private life of lordship there be saying what may discover said vicar how if there be wife still living even noble lord can not have two wife at same time seems strange that one must make greater preparation for journey to london by land than voyage to lisbon by sea a regard latter kit be put together in hour two be then ready to embark a regard former two traveller first considered easiest way then cost of journey that of stay in london then departure of others so a to form company against highway robber then arranged for halting resting place hired horse for be to ride way engaged servant made will so at last be ready to begin journey company consisted of two three rider to merchant of london who travel over country visiting shop keeper in interest of master be excellent fellow traveller being accustomed to road having fear of highwayman knowing proper charge must be made at roadside inn knowing a well what house can be best trusted to provide home brewed ale being good at one house wine at so forth reckoned five day for journey if weather continued fine be then july height of summer vicar thought that perhaps week ten day must suffice for business in town therefore might expect back in three week captain crowle must have gone with be fearful of losing ward for first time in life barred bolted door at night if went abroad left house in custody of gardener stout country lad who must make sturdy fight in case of attempt at violence violence be not weapon be in favour with lordship if have be whole town must have risen in defence of molly for three week therefore waited for part in greater anxiety than rest because ship have now received cargo feared that must have to weigh anchor slip down river before return of messenger at time when knew not what must happen what must do many wild scheme came into head must carry girl away must foreclose mortgage sell land carry fortune with must sail in one of own ship across atlantic make new home for in american colony however in end have a will learn to accept misfortune to resign to what promised to be lifelong penalty inflicted for sin of molly who be a free from sin a woman not saint can hope to be by wickedness of man whose life way be far removed from molly might have be supposed to be incapable of afflicting in way friend therefore started on journey arriving in due time at london when began business without delay briefly be recommended to very learned counsel old in great practice whose opinion be more highly valued than perhaps of other lawyer be avaricious be necessary to pay very handsome fee before must consider case when accepted fee gave most careful consideration opinion be a follows fact that there be marriage between woman b be undoubted evidence of parish clerk may be set aside except to prove fact because doe not appear that bride removed domino might however become part of b case that clergyman did not witness removal of domino what clerk saw be woman dressed in pink silk cloak with hood over head domino concealing face who signed name of mary miller for same reason evidence of john pentecrosse rest only on dress of bride may therefore be taken a worth that more at same time dress of bride be important have intimation of b refusal to keep promise at six o'clock a be allowed presented if b be not there how must be able at moment notice to procure woman to personate wearing cloak of same colour a b ready to sign name falsely theory be impossible for demand whole chain of fortuitous occurrence coincidence a that must find woman of abandoned character accidentally near church ready to commit crime dressed a b be expected to dress considered worthy of trust with so great secret on other hand have evidence of apparently conclusive kind b guardian who be taking morning air in garden say positively that one left house b mother black servant declare that b be in kitchen with morning say seems at first conclusive court must probably hold that mother evidence be likely to be in supposed interest of child while negress must be expected if be attached to mistress to give evidence that thought likely to be of service be directed to give case be remarkable so far a know without precedent be supported on side by flat assertion be true deliberate perjury a regard bad character of think must have very little weight setting aside be evil reputation might perhaps taint evidence also setting aside partiality of mother might also perhaps taint evidence have broad simple fact that have warning of b intention to keep away that presented according to arrangement that be met by woman dressed exactly a have be arranged with b that be married that register be signed by woman in name of b be of opinion therefore if case be brought into court there will be pleading on side of great interest that court will decide in favour of if case go up for appeal will again be decided in favour of that if case be taken up to lord court must also decide in favour of if action be taken must be at cost charge of guardian because lady property in default of settlement must in event think probable fall into hand of thus adjudged to be husband advise therefore that submission be made to even though b continues to deny marriage will be invited to make suitable provision will undertake not to molest to compel to leave guardian to live with with opinion to guide vicar wrote to lord fylingdale asking for interview be received with show of cold politeness have given reason sir to remember face however pas over injury allowed to utter be come presume in name of unfortunate wife who for reason unknown to denies own marriage well sir message message lord be briefly have taken counsel opinion on business so have be on whole to effect that if dispute lordship claim will probably lose own counsel be also of opinion for own part will advise friend to accept what seems impossible to deny will do well will be pleased confess to see business settled without taking into court must like if possible to carry home with concession of lordship in response to submission what concession seems to that countess have right to insist upon concession whole of property a know be own fear be case will probably make certain change in administration of property now property will relieve worthy captain of control a regard other point must acknowledge that have treated with insult intolerable be not in position to make term what do ask first freedom from personal molestation be granted at once may tell countess on consideration will see will exercise marital right when consent to confess falsehood to ask pardon for offence may perhaps extend personal protection not otherwise a for allowance maintenance reverence be not serious say that be not wife law say be prepared to say that be by law be compelled to maintain let therefore invoke intervention of law to procure will have to confess many perjury till then nothing do understand sir nothing chapter xxxix fruit of submission molly dear captain voice be broken be doing mine be old fool yet thought be doing best for nay said molly be one fault be great misfortune must take asked captain will take can claim vicar answered revenge

at hour fixed woman dressed masked a have be arranged there be explanation possible understand very clearly that fact outweighs evidence on side there be nothing to be done must submit saving only personal freedom molly man confesses that have wish to molest nothing to gain by molestation to be sure without can take what plea presence indeed must be hindrance reproach to mode of life so talked together with sadness heaviness yet for one thing be well pleased that molly have not be forced into daily companionship with man for must have killed body soul if soul can be destroyed by despair

mystery expose cheat perhaps know not what may happen a for fortune molly be a good a gone yourself remain be far more precious than gold silver in land illustration be far more precious than gold silver in land so parted for five month until return knew nothing of what be done may easily guess what be done first of letter came from london be addressed to captain crowle called upon to prepare book account connected with estate of mary countess of fylingdale for information of right honourable earl of fylingdale be written by attorney announced intention of writer to send down person one stephen bisse attorney at law duly authorised to examine to audit account to make known lordship intention a regard administration of estate captain ignorant of law took letter to vicar for advice said latter may be simply first step to taking over whole of property may be first step towards system of revenge persecution for if attorney who come here to investigate account find anything irregular may be trapped into legal expense heaven know what to follow captain however have not commanded ship in vain for commanding officer of ship must keep log paper connected with cargo lading unlading pay of ship company port due everything must in word be a methodical in account a quill driver ashore may examine account a much a plea declared be right nevertheless friend be advised place whole business in hand of one who know law in end may be far cheaper in port there must be one more person skilled in part of law concern trade commerce import export custom excise harbour due at lynn there be such one attorney notary man of great probity responsibility mr nathaniel redman by name to captain entrusted paper of estate paper have be accumulating for eighteen year represented increase administration of very large estate be now voluminous to highest degree mere perusal of must entail labour of many attorney for many week while audit of whole bit by bit must engage same person many month even year earl of fylingdale will have account audited will said mr redman then lordship be in immediate want of money why can not take what want sir be lady guardian have to be released from trust before hand over property without release will keep whole mean that lordship must wait for long tedious business of complete audit say long tedious because if examination of account be undertaken in spirit of hostility can raise in turn objection after objection by going back to commencement of trust in other word captain if paper be preserved doubt not will be in position to delay acquisition of estate by earl almost indefinitely at whose charge asked vicar for captain have mean of paying heavy expense at charge of estate oh sir think that attorney of london to say nothing of must embark upon so large business save at charge of estate be then in interest to prolong examination into account be most certainly in interest of gentleman from london of sighed heavily if report be true believe that lord fylingdale will prolong inquiry person who be promised presently arrived with credential be quite young man apparently about two three twenty letter to captain crowle described a attorney at law be quick of speech of greatest possible assurance in manner in appearance be small of stature pasty faced with turned up nose possession of must be regarded by owner a misfortune personal defect like round back be said on other hand to be indication of great self conceit came therefore be set down at crown inquired for residence of captain crowle on whom called

notary job be turned over to oh understood captain crowle must confer with personally did so well sir if will see mr redman can confer with instead job be captain in fact have be warned not to make communication to hold conversation with attorney felt only safe therefore in repeating that job be mr redman may however come to preliminary captain crowle estate now captain waved hand in direction of garden door job young man be mr redman there be letter take to mr bisse accordingly retired repaired to office residence of mr redman to whom gave letter will have difficulty presume said hope not of course know law in matter can direct young gentleman mr redman be well stricken in year must direct father go on will proceed in accordance with power will take good care that keep within power now sir what do propose mr redman spoke from commanding position of armchair before large table be also large imposing man to look at while mr bisse stood before small insignificant original impudence fast deserting a for mr redman professional pride be aroused young skip jack dared to direct in matter of law did be confess said mr bisse disappointed to find that noble client advance be received with suspicion hoped that captain crowle must have met in spirit of confidence come sir between have noble client to complain of sends attorney here captain crowle meet in person of attorney well matter not captain crowle have doubt reason of own for action must however since be men of business a say demand exact audit interest involved be understand very considerable be very considerable will however ask for advance of ten thousand pound to be made to lordship on account advance guardian to advance money before have audited account dear sir be serious admit that there will be great deal more than l admit nothing be not proved then refuse to give client anything air of assurance began to desert in fact have be especially charged to open proceeding by demanding such advance refuse to do anything illegal paper will show extent nature of estate can then claim whole must first send in claim be prepared with release mr bisse hesitated instruction be to demand strict scrutiny of account be waiting for must like to see paper mr redman led into adjoining room where on shelf on table book paper be laid out in order tied up labelled clerk said mr redman will go through paper with will look on paper mr bisse gazed with dismay upon pile before will have to peruse to examine to pas scrap of paper in room captain crowle sir be most methodical man in world paper will take month year perhaps have instruction sir said mr bisse crestfallen must write to principal for further instruction will probably be best course good morning sir mr bisse wrote accordingly meanwhile made attempt to assert authority went to quay looked about with satisfaction at proof evidence of brisk trade entered counting house where clerk be at work name said pompously be bisse mr stephen bisse attorney at law be here a attorney for right honourable earl of fylingdale what do want asked chief clerk will at once show ledger day book book used by in daily business must go to mr redman sir office be beside customhouse without permission can hing for mr redman have be before see refuse at peril said mr bisse be will go out of counting house sir said chief clerk will leave quay take order from mr redman in place of captain crowle so mr bisse departed walked from quay to common stathe there looking at ship lying moored in stream asked waterman if by chance of belonged to captain crowle man pointed to one then said mr bisse take to ship mr redman have be before here a well climbed up ladder be about to step on deck when mate accosted what be business friend asked mr bisse replied a have done in counting house well sir said mate ca come aboard here stranger be not allowed aboard ship without order from captain crowle mr redman so mr bisse have to go ashore again found fear town of lynn inhospitable in fact everybody be in favour of molly name of lord fylingdale stank one must speak to wandered about waiting for reply to letter asking for further instruction in disconsolate crestfallen spirit very different from confident assurance have shown on arrival new instruction reached in about ten day again waited on mr redman well sir asked latter be come to direct in matter of law have received new instruction young man put question aside from principal be to effect that if will draw up for schedule of whole estate be to forward to london to receive order thereupon a to what part of account must specially examine sir at outset refuse to accept anything general release will represent to principal that part of complicated estate be involved with whole transaction precede be to say purchase of farm house have to be made by combined saving from source of income consequently special line of investigation will necessitate wide prolonged examination perceive that be determined to give trouble not so sir be determined to resist persecution instruction if understand aright be to fix upon captain crowle difficulty if possible to accuse of malversation mr bisse changed colour be in fact secret instruction now sir have paper in order will find impossible while stand at elbow to discover to invent loophole at same time will prolong investigation if once enter upon a much a possible may inform principal of will return a soon a have further instruction will not at least prepare schedule of property certainly will have prepared in readiness for next visit will be suppose in ten day hope find stay pleasant sir be not pleasant at inn people be barely civil be treated everywhere a if be frenchman not frenchman attorney of lord fylingdale mr redman addressed therefore with aid of captain to schedule estate be far greater than have anticipated why said be surprised that noble earl must marry girl for money have world suspected truth there must have be abduction week then proceeded to go through long list of land house mortgage money lying idle jewel everything only charge upon estate seems to be annuity of l year for mother what money have taken for maintenance why none none did girl live on air what for own service nothing lived rent free be molly own house mother money kept household well captain thing be incredible have conducted whole business from death of molly father to present day actually for nothing be for little maid captain have acted dare say for best with submission have acted like fool however be not too late to remedy will charge estate will now become lord fylingdale with l year salary for administering estate for managing business will be impossible to refuse claim will set down l year for maintenance of ward captain stared here be turning of table with vengeance claim be just reasonable moderate will not advance a thing to be objected to will meantime go through account take out l year for eighteen year must be l money must be considered a used for investment will therefore set apart l year a soon a amount to sufficient sum to be represented by investment will set apart piece of property a own will represent much larger sum than l ward will not after be left penniless if bequeath money have young man be going to direct lady of lynn in matter of law be in fact captain be so simple that have never occurred to that must take salary for conduct of business that must ask for allowance for maintenance of ward timely discovery by attorney in end saved molly from poverty left still in comparison with most girl of place of county very considerable heiress when mr bisse few day later arrived with instruction found drawn up for statement for eighteen year of captain trusteeship on working side of account be shown charge of l year a provided by will of molly father for widow for life similar sum for maintenance of ward salary of l to captain crowle for managing business in name of firm a shipper general merchant mr stephen bisse by time have quite lost assurance attempted objection suppose said will allow inspection of book certainly will however find difficult to make out be acquainted with routine work of counting house mr bisse owned that be not will be asked said if have examined book will examine what please mr redman understood by time character of young attorney chief clerk of counting house will be with to answer question please to ask have come to lynn see by order of principal instructed that guardian be old addle headed sailor whose account must certainly prove liable to question very likely open to dispute to claim be aware that noble client desired nothing so much a to ruin old sailor that be also in great necessity for want of money that be anxious for reason unknown to attorney that question of validity of marriage must not be raised tried in open court have be met by man of law by account of most complicated kind by direct refusal to part with money until final release have be obtained for guardian therefore referred to principal twice on second occasion be told that lordship must not wait that be to guard against fraud by examination of book a be possible that be to get rid of guardian grant release if account allowed to do so lay hand on monies available report progress in short did amended schedule reserved property amounting in value to l year a invested year after year therefore at something like compound interest so that deduction gave captain personal real property representing l rest be acknowledged to be property of ward therefore assuming marriage to be valid under control of lord fylingdale auditor went to counting house called for book opened one two at random looked wise made note two for show asked question two for pretence went away done repaired to mr redman office again tendered full release to captain crowle for trusteeship document in molly be called by maiden name not by of countess of fylingdale when be signed sealed rendered old man free of persecution left estate entirely in hand of pretended husband be aware sir of course said mr bisse that release accepted by captain crowle also accepts truth of client statement a regard marriage be not going to dispute fact have opinion weight of evidence presumption be against a lordship only want fortune can take may ask what be instructed to do about instruction be first to receive monies in hand save what be wanted for current expense in conducting business will see what captain crowle have in strong room can take money to day if please next jewel gold chain bracelet etc belonging to countess can have also a regard land house mortgage business lord will consider what be best to be done be directed to find person of integrity in place who will receive rent carry on business fear can not ask for assistance can may be still interest that affair of firm will be well managed chief clerk in counting house be best man can appoint now receives l year can give what captain have l know how long arrangement will last mean that client will probably waste squander whole desire to speak of nobleman with respect be however in expenditure even more profuse than becomes high rank molly shed tear over loss of jewel brought box down with own hand opened took out content to be verified by inventory shut locked gave attorney key captain led downstairs to cellar in wall of cupboard have be constructed with stone in front removable with little trouble formed strong room here be box of guinea waiting to be invested employed know not how many there be mr bisse carried away with when departed next day for london be escorted by four stout fellow armed with cudgel pistol riding beside post chaise however reached london in safety delivered prize wonder said mr redman how long will be before instruction come for foreclosing of mortgage sale of property be doubtful after said vicar who always doubted because always saw side of question whether have done rightly must have made good fight must have proved at least that lord fylingdale be in desperate strait for money jack be right said molly nothing can be done until find

who be there to buy then came letter of rebuke answered by letter of remonstrance money must be raised somehow money have be advanced on security of molly property lord be in difficulty be almost incredible that man must be able in so short time to waste dissipate so large sum of money when returned went ashore first person saw be unfortunate chief clerk promoted to be manager mr pentecrosse

be taken about country in order to show world true meaning of fribble beau be however something to credit that in end remembered old tradition saw a be pray heaven that repentance be thorough let at least forgive said molly seemed harmless old gentleman one must never have thought capable of acting so dishonourable part repented must forgive meantime be nearer mysterious woman who personated molly do understand why did do understand how be done week later came letter time be from rev benjamin purdon be be truly impudent letter worthy of man character to captain crowle sir have hesitated for time whether to address on subject of ward pretended marriage with late patron lord fylingdale say pretended because be in position to expose whole deception can place in possession of whole of fact be simple can not be denied disproved ward be not in church at be not married place be taken by woman who personated appearing in ward dress namely pink silk cloak hood thrown over head who performed ceremony be deceived be to say be told name of bride there be nothing to awaken suspicion at point a proof that part of story be true must ask ward to write name in full must then ask to compare that writing with signature in register be stupid cried vicar have be struck with judicial stupidity let instantly without delay proceed to test molly dear get paper pen ink so now sit at

many letter prided apparently on clearness beauty of hand molly on other hand showed letter awkwardly formed not in line of unequal height evident work of one unaccustomed to writing what doubt have now asked vicar friend see daylight let return to complete reverend brother letter letter thus continued have now take satisfied that ward must not possibly have penned that signature have doubt if have before ward denial be truth at same time appear to have considered matter worth fighting be not for assuredly court of justice even with handwriting a evidence must have decided against so far be well advised therefore withdrew opposition suffered husband to take over what claimed control of estate from what be informed be pursuing course of mad riot in alone sits cold composed a be wont for contemplation of wickedness in action be more to taste than becoming actor be also playing losing heavily therefore have reason to believe that will before long get through estate of so called wife hope will because will then have nothing left at last state of man will be a miserable a deserves man too have revenge in sight said vicar come now to main point suppose that more than third so of ward fortune have yet be wasted will enable to save rest for certain consideration need not write down nature noble patron promised to pay l on marriage with heiress be large sum of money service rendered be worth more be own confederacy suppose for honour of british aristocracy regret to inform that lord fylingdale repudiates contract say that may take step please refuse to pay that consideration need not go on in word will give nothing under circumstance will expose whole affair put end at least to further depredation if therefore take over obligation upon be prepared to draw up account of whole business personation of ward reason manner of explanation of very remarkable coincidence so remarkable a to seem impossible of substitution of one woman for at moment notice further promise that information will at once turn table that can refuse to let lordship interfere further with ward estate that can take step to declare so called marriage null void nothing will be left for explanation will be quite simple straightforward can put evidence in hand little suspect further promise engage to ask for nothing until have proved have to be proved have established fact that ward

lady that clergyman be ready to swear that bride be lady that register showed signature there must be change whatever of success in disputing denying marriage vicar perceiving weight of evidence adding to apparent impossibility of procuring at moment notice personation of bride reluctantly advised submission while being firmly persuaded that molly mother have spoken truth that there be devilry somewhere submitted with what result have seen be believe rule that playwriters where have plot with mystery secret in to keep audience in ignorance so to heighten interest until revelation in last act clear up mystery relief spectator of suspense others again allow audience to understand at outset that heroine hero be victim of villainy explain full nature of villainy until end when plot
