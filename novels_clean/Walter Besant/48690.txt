proclaimed humble origin only because if attempted to conceal other people must proclaim for indeed without attributing extraordinary malice to lady chancellor unsuccessful rival enemy statement be probably true nothing being more common during animated debate than for lady to hurl at other head such fact procurable a might be calculated to damage reputation of family so much so that after

trouble indeed be even said that that with many other circumstance showing blackest ingratitude so woman held up hand wondered what men wanted grace enemy said that famous wrinkle be caused by three great vice of pride ambition avarice declared that if developed such furrow must represent other great vice of vanity a for third husband must one expect poor young man to fall in love with woman already fifty eight when married duchess be richly plainly dressed in black velvet lace figure be still full a rose to greet chancellor ward leaned upon gold headed stick being somewhat troubled with gout smile be encouraging kind towards earl to constance a to political enemy who be to be treated with external courtesy bowed low coldly inclined head in return to profound act of deference paid to by professor chancellor fussy little woman with withered cheek wrinkled brow thin gray lock sat at table hardly rose to greet ward whom motioned to chair then looked at constance waited for to explain presence ' come with lord chester on occasion ' said constance 'as nearest female relation a ladyship be probably aware be second cousin ' chancellor bowed then professor spoke ask ladyship permission to appear in support of pupil on important occasion guardian lady boltons be unfortunately too ill to be present 'there be reason suppose ' said chancellor ungraciously with glance of anxiety at duchess must not be present professor ingleby unless be earl of chester must rather see alone proceeding be most formal ' lord chester who be very grave merely shook head then chancellor shuffled about paper for few moment addressed ward lordship will kindly give best attention ' began with approach to blandness ' be glad in first place to congratulate on health appearance strength have received best report on moral religious behaviour docility so on from guardian lady boltons be only sorry that be not able to be here in order to receive from thanks for faithful conscientious discharge of duty from duchess of dunstanburgh recognition of service in term come from one with more weight more dignity than from grace ' duchess held up hand in deprecation professor nodded lifted up hand smiled a if word of thanks from duchess be for part wanted in order to be perfectly happy earl one be sorry to say sat looking straight at chancellor without expression of kind unless be one of patient endurance chancellor went on 'you will shortly now know pas from guardianship to hand care of far more able worthy to hold rein of authority than ' here constance rose 'before ladyship go further beg to state to that lord chester have only morning informed of proposal made to by grace of dunstanburgh be now under consideration ' certainly be ' said chancellor be about ' 'before proceed ' constance changed colour voice be firm 'you will permit also to make official formal application in presence of duchess herself who will be sure be witness professor ingleby for hand of lord chester there be think occasion for to say anything in addition to simple proposal what must add must probably not influence ladyship decision know be to be known about ' 'this be most astonishing ' cried duchess ask grace what be astonishing about proposal may remind have known lord chester life that be equal in point of rank position wealth that be if may say so not altogether undistinguished even in house of grace be so exalted ornament have to do with judgment of ladyship not opinion of duchess ' chancellor turned anxiously to patroness a if for direction replied with dignity 'your ladyship be aware that a earlier applicant proposal must naturally take precedence in ladyship consideration of later one might even demand that be considered on own merit without reference at to lady carlyon proposal with regard to keep own opinion constance remarked coldly that grace opinion be unfortunately in most important matter exactly opposite to own to of friend be contented to disagree with then informed chancellor that a decision have be given a to marriage of lord chester case be still before submitted proposal of herself of duchess must be weighed by ladyship 'and added ' must humbly submit that there be many other consideration in case of so old great house a represented by lord chester must be taken account of higher rank than own for instance need not be desired greater wealth many other thing in humbler marriage may be considered will go further in room be a be secret chamber say boldly that care must be taken to continue so old illustrious line 'and why ' cried duchess sharply dropping stick 'why must not be continued ' here remarkable thing happened lord chester must have affected complete ignorance of insult constance have deliberately flung in rival teeth what did do be to turn slowly round stare in undisguised wonder at duchess a if surprised at audacity even grace with pride experience must not sustain calm cold look faltered said more lord chester picked up stick handed to with low bow ' be much obliged to lady carlyon ' said chancellor tapping knuckle with glass much obliged to be sure for laying down rule for guidance mine in interpretation of law duty that however may pas be business although confess that interruption be of most surprising unprecedented nature to proceed with case before be that of proposal made by duchess of dunstanburgh ' 'do understand ' asked lady carlyon 'that refuse to receive proposal remember that must receive can not help receiving be public matter will if necessary be brought before house before nation say that ladyship must receive proposal ' word ' cried chancellor word ' 'perhaps said duchess lady carlyon proposal be to be received let ask that may be received even if against precedent consideration of case must be proceeded with at once perhaps ladyship decision might be given on spot good very good ' chancellor be glad to get out of difficulty will take second proposal into consideration a well a first now then lord have be already informed that duchess have asked for hand ' here duchess made gesture slowly rose a if about to speak ' proposition of kind ' said in clear firm voice 'naturally brings with to young man especially young man of order sense of embarrassment have be taught be ' here bent brow put on glass at professor who be bowing head at period keeping time with hand a if in deference to word of duchess a if contained truth must not be suffered to be forgotten 'if have be properly taught sacredness of marriage state unworthiness of man duty of submission obedience when rightly carried out lead to higher level in proportion to soundness of training goodness of heart be embarrassed when time of great happiness arrives professor bowed spread hand a if in agreement with so much wisdom so beautifully expressed 'lord chester ' continued duchess have long watched in silence have seen in quality believe befit consort of rank posse pride of birth dexterity skill grace know how to wield such authority a becomes man will exchange earl coronet for higher one of duke be sure will wear worthily will ' here constance interrupted 'permit grace to remind that chancellor decision have not yet be given ' duchess sat down frowning young lady must be made to feel resentment for moment gave way scowled leaning chin upon stick be hard face even when smiled when frowned be face to look upon tremble chancellor turned over paper impatiently see nothing ' said ' see nothing at in proposition made by lady carlyon to alter opinion previously formed that duchess have made offer seems in way calculated to promote moral spiritual material happiness of ward ' ask ' said lord chester quietly may express own view on somewhat important matter ' ' chancellor positively shrieked 'you ignorance in boy be brought up be disgraceful ward in chancery to express opinion upon own marriage positively real ward in chancery be world turning upside down ' audacity of remark happy calmness with be proffered be irresistible lady except chancellor laughed duchess loudly little escapade of youth ignorance amused constance laughed too with little pity professor laughed with show of shame a if lord chester ignorance reflected in manner upon then chancellor went on again with temper resume be duty to consider nothing interest of ward very good have considered lord chester in giving hand to duchess of dunstanburgh serve best highest interest case be decided there be more to be said 'there be on contrary much more to be said ' observed constance ' give ladyship notice of appeal to house of peeress will appeal to to nation through whether decision in case be reasonable just in accordance with interest of ward ' be indeed formidable threat appeal to house meant with such fighting power a constance party although minority possessed knew how to direct delay of perhaps six month even if case came on from day to day even practised old duchess used to wordy warfare of house shrank from such contest 'you will not surely lady carlyon said 'drag cousin name into supreme court of appeal ' certainly will ' replied constance 'it will cost hundred of thousand month month of struggle 'as for cost be affair a for delay can wait perhaps longer than grace ' duchess said more twice have lady carlyon insulted revenge must wait 'we have already said 'occupied too much of chancellor valuable time wish ladyship good morning ' lord chester offered arm 'thank ' said accepting 'as far a carriage door only for present trust lord that before long will have right to enter carriage with meanwhile believe that be not through fault that name be to be made subject of public discussion pending appeal let not betray by appearing together feeling other than of pure friendship hope ' viciously addressing constance 'that young lady will observe same prudence ' constance simply bowed said nothing chancellor rose shook hand with ward retired duchess leaned upon strong arm led to carriage kissed hand in farewell to young man with so much affection friendly interest that be beautiful to behold after act of politeness young man returned to constance 'painted began 'edward will not allow silence sir part here for present 'constance ' whispered 'you will not forget said ' 'not one word ' replied with troubled brow 'but must meet more for while 'courage ' cried professor have gained time ' chapter iv great duchess impossible of course so important case a appeal of lady carlyon must be concealed in fact constance policy be evidently to give a much publicity a possible rightly judged that although in own order in house have to look at thing from many point of view motif of policy might be considered sufficient to override sentimental objection be not likely that much weight must be attached to young man feeling yet duchess have many enemy even on own side of house private enemy wounded by pride insolence who must rejoice at seeing meet with check in self willed selfish course besides house there be outside world to consider there be never greater need on part of governing caste for conciliation respect to public opinion than at moment fact perfectly

that popular sympathy awakened in favour at moment a present might assume such strength a to be irresistible force how must sympathy of people be otherwise than on side marriage of old middle aged woman with young men common though have become must never be regarded by youth of sex a natural young woman bitterly complained that lover provided for by equality of age be taken from that time be so

present except such a be sent out to exercise child such a received permission for special purpose be forbidden right of public meeting newspaper be stopped religious worship of old kind be prohibited apparently harsh arbitrary measure tendered necessary by refractory mutinous conduct of lower class of woman who resented deposition be difficult to enforce required street must be garrisoned to do thirty thousand additional men be needed be sent up by jack kennion who have recruited double number a woman refused to obey be impossible to use violence towards men be ordered to turn hose upon have desired effect few draggled petticoat lamentable in proved sufficient to clear street then word be given to bring out men parade in district indeed before order there be healthy encouraging sign on side that spirit of revolt be spreading even in most secluded home men who formed first army be entirely country born bred have be accustomed to work together freedom became natural to from first men

doctrine of new religion turned obedient ear to exhortation of who exposed inefficacy of old government finally be promoted to work of kind in public department be enlisted in army presently became joy of young fellow to go home show new idea new manner new uniform new religion to sister whose rule acknowledged no longer there came next feeble youth who have not courage to shake off old chain brain to adopt new teaching poor creature must not even fraternise knew not how to make friend be thought that best chance be to be kept continually in barrack there to work at trade have be taught to eat at common table to live in common room to be made strong by physical exercise out of poor material however very little good stuff must be made in long run be chiefly turned into copying clerk
