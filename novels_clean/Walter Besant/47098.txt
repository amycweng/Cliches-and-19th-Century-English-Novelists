not unpleasant sensation one need not disguise fact that possession of power knowledge of own benevolent intention gave angela better opinion of herself than have ever known before herein friend lie if will rightly regard true reason of feminine love for power illustrated by chaucer for few who have from time to time wielded authority have ever be persuaded that wielded wisely benevolently

assured miss kennedy that have searched whole neighborhood for suitable place must find none so good a own house a for house of messenger property be liable said to demand of lawyer firm have mercy on

sovereign that must pay cabman more than twice fare that be wrong to pay guinea for heidsieck monopole when can get pommery greno at seven sixpence then too paused abruptly because felt a if have betrayed have cabinet maker to do with pommery greno fortunately angela did not hear latter part of speech be reflecting on ease with crafty man say bunker may compass end with simple say pretend said to know rope must not have allowed to be taken in quite so readily by good uncle do know eye when be serious be not often be really good angela perceived be serious now do know that name of uncle who be indirectly so to speak connected with robin redbreast be originally bunker changed after child be dead came into property wish have be with said simply suppose must take chance a other girl do most

brought up short when angela remembered that be talking to artisan froze when harry reflected that be dressmaker to whom be communicating bit of inner soul checked when happened day forgot disguise

that be standing at wicket gate over gate be effigy of ship in full sail done in stone mr bunker opened door led way to court within then great stillness fell upon girl spirit outside wagon cart omnibus thundered rolled must hear plainly enough must hear tramp of thousand foot noise outside be only contrast to quiet within wall of brick with iron railing separated tumult from calm seemed a if within court there be noise at so sharp sudden be contrast stood in oblong court separated from road by wall above named on hand be row of small house containing apparently four room be built of red

invited companion to follow be small well proportioned room with low ceiling furnished sufficiently there be clean white curtain with rose colored ribbon window be open in stood pot of mignonette now at best at window sat on one side old gentleman with silvery white hair spectacle who be reading on other side girl with work on lap sewing now cap'n sorensen said mr bunker without formality of greeting have got chance take leave since can afford to be particular ca be not rich enough have snorted looked about with contempt man who have banker naturally feel for one who have life in

impossible actual fact can with eye of mind make unreal stand before in flesh therefore when be down trodden may proceed without trouble danger of turning have be known to bring total extinction upon worm to take revenge upon enemy in imagination mr bunker who be at moment uncertain whether hated miss kennedy more than hated nephew went home glowing with thought few short month must elapse before must be able to set foot upon former crush because at rate be going on must not last more than time then must send in bill sue sell up drive out of place stripped of last farthing might go bunker be told that might go in presence of inmate then thought of nephew while smote pavement with iron end of umbrella cold dew appeared upon nose place where inward agitation be frequently betrayed in way shivered looking about suddenly a if be frightened yet what harm be harry goslett likely to do what be name dear asked angela softly without inspection of work on table be wondering how pretty fragile flower must be found in whitechapel o ignorance of newnham for might have reflected that rarest most beautiful plant be found in most savage place there be beautiful botanizing one be told in ural

may more thing consider more incomprehensible doe sum of thing appear inquiring reader know how nelly divined that visitor be lady chapter viii what got by dressmaker shop without dressmaker to manage must be angela considered in perplexity like ship without steersman therefore waited with impatience promised visit of rebekah hermitage whom be to get cheap according to mr bunker on account of sabbatarian view came in evening while angela be walking on green with sprightly cabinet maker be sunset angela have be remarking to companion with sort of irrational surprise that phenomenon coincident with close of day be just a brilliantly colored lavishly displayed for squalid east a for luxurious west perhaps indeed there be not many place in london where sunset doe produce such good effect a at stepney green narrow strip so called in shape resembles too nearly closed umbrella thickish walking stick there be tree in bed of flower seat for who wish to sit walk for who wish to walk better house of green bormalack be on west dingy side be on east face setting sun be of good age at least hundred fifty year old be built of warm red brick have door ornamented with old fashioned shell have appearance of solid respectability make rest of stepney proud of here in former day dwelt aristocracy of parish on side be house taken by angela for dressmaking institution house in grandfather be born reason why sunset be more splendid sunrise brighter at stepney than at opposite end of london be that sun set behind great bank of cloud forever lie over london town lends departure to happy dweller of east strange wonderful effect now when rise be naturally in east where there be cloud of smoke to hide brightness of face green evening be crowded be not so fashionable promenade a whitechapel road on other hand posse charm of comparative quiet there be noise of vehicle only shouting of child loud laughter of gaillard 'prentice coy giggle of young lady to whom have imparted last merry jape loud whisper of lady who be exchanging confidence about complaint complaint of friend musical laugh of girl old people have crept home mother be at home putting child to bed father be mostly engaged with evening pipe demand chair within four wall glass of something green be given up to youth youth be principally given up to love making in arcadia said harry nymph be wooed swain be interrupted by arrival of uncle who pushed way through crowd with usual important bustle followed by young person looked for at mr bormalack said to angela reproachfully here be with young man a usual a if time be object to why not with young man mr bunker asked angela did not explain reason for objecting to companion proceeded to introduce companion here be miss kennedy said be rebekah hermitage have brought with to prevent mistake may take on recommendation nobody in neighborhood of stepney want better recommendation than mine one of bunker say ask more what beautiful what enviable reputation murmured nephew oh be one of bunker mr bunker glared at answered not never within present experience have found at loss to give indignation word on occasion have be known to swear into shudder immortal god who heard to swear at nephew however careless sniggering youth who looked talked like swell must felt be more than useless boy must only snigger more must have liked knocking down there be obvious reason why be not to be seriously contemplated turned to girl who have come with rebekah said with condescension may speak up told father must stand by will at least said angela in stateliest manner begin by making miss hermitage suppose will want support saw before girl about two three twenty year of age be short of stature sturdy complexion be dark with black hair dark eye be bright firm mouth square chin gave pugnacious appearance in fact have be fighting life more desperately even than other girl about because be heavily handicapped by awkwardness of religion mr bunker said young person who certainly did not look a if wanted backing up tell want forewoman want forewoman echoed agent a if interpreting for yes do angela replied know to begin with about religious opinion know said agent standing between two party a if retained for interest of know already religious opinion very well miss rebekah looked disappointed at losing chance of expounding then can only say can never give way in matter of truth in truth said agent be a obstinate a pig expect replied angela feeling that half crown hour man be really stupendous nuisance doe not expect echoed mr bunker turning to rebekah what did tell now see effect of recommendation take off wage said rebekah with obvious effort showed how vital be importance of pay take off wage if like of course ca expect to labor for five day be paid for six on saturday be sabbath day do work therein neither man servant maid servant ox as man servant maid servant ox as repeated agent solemnly there be sunday however said angela what have got to say about sunday now asked mr bunker with change of front of day be in week interpolated sprightly one dearly love one day be day rebekah impatient of frivolity stopped at once do a little a can said on sunday because of weaker brother sunday keep a holiday well angela began rather to envy young woman who be clear gainer of whole day by religion well miss hermitage will come to on trial thank can settle about deduction afterward if please if will come to morrow be right now if please to take turn with will talk thing over together goodnight mr bunker took girl arm led away being anxious to get bunker out of sight aspect of agent annoyed irritated almost beyond endurance so left with nephew one of bunker harry repeated softly here growled uncle dangling after girl when ought to be at work how long must like to know be hard working stepney folk to be troubled with idle good for nothing vagabond eh sir how long suppose mean to do anything for when money be gone do hear sir do hear hear uncle a usual young man laughed sat upon arm of garden seat with hand in pocket laughed insolent exasperating laugh now mr bunker in life have never seen least necessity occasion for laughing at anything at far le at hitherto have one dared to laugh at sniggerin ' peacock added mr bunker fiercely rattling bunch of key in pocket harry laughed again with more abandon uncle of who regarded with so much dislike seemed very humorous person connection by marriage said there be one question have very much wished to put to when traded away now three twenty year ago thereabouts remember circumstance dare say better than can be expected to do what did get for then bunker color changed cheek became quite white harry thought be effect of wrath went on crown hour of course during negotiation dare say took week that understand what else come uncle what else did get be too dark for young man to perceive full effect of question sudden change of color escaped notice observed strange angry light in uncle eye saw that opened mouth once twice a if to speak shut lip again without saying word harry be greatly surprised to see uncle presently turn on heel walk straight away that question seems to be facer must be repeated whenever good old man becomes offensive wonder what did get for a for mr bunker retired to own house in beaumont square walking with quick step hanging head let in with latch key turned into office of course be first room of ground floor be quite dark now save for faint light from street gas mr bunker did not want light sat down rested face on hand with heavy sigh house be empty because housekeeper only servant be out sat without moving for hour so then lifted head looked about have forgotten where be why came there shuddered then hastily lit candle went upstairs to own bedroom room have one piece of furniture not always found in bedroom be good sized fireproof safe stood in corner mr bunker placed candle on safe stooping down began to grope about with key for lock took time to find keyhole when safe be opened took longer to find paper wanted for be at very back of presently however lifted head with bundle in hand now if be obliged to account for everything ought not to be expected be more than one asks of scientific men must account for what followed by remarking that blood be apt to get into brain of people especially elderly people above stout elderly people when stoop for length of time that history record many remarkable manifestation of spirit world have followed posture of stooping too prolonged produce in fact condition of brain beloved by ghost there be leading case of man at cambridge who after stooping for book saw ghost of own bed maker at time when knew to be in bosom of family eating up bread butter drinking tea rat have be seen by others troop of rat a many rat a followed piper where there be rat there be even recorded case of man who saw ghost of prognosticated dissolution in fact killed exactly fifty two year after event so really there be nothing at unusual in fact that mr bunker saw something when lifted head remarkable thing be that saw very person of whom have be thinking ever since nephew question no other than deceased wife sister have never loved at in least desired to marry make case more remarkable still stood before just a if be alive gazed upon with reproachful eye behaved with great coolness presence of mind few men must have shown more bravery just dropped candle out of one hand paper out of other fell back upon bed with white face quivering lip men must have run did not in fact must not knee instinctively knew that be useless to run from ghost refused to aid caroline groaned a spoke figure vanished making sign saying word after while seeing that ghost came more mr bunker pulled together picked up paper candle went slowly downstairs again turning moment to see if sister in law came too did not went to bright gas lit back parlor where supper be spread after supper mixed glass of brandy water stiff after drinking mixed began to smoke pipe while turned over paper ca have meant anything said what must boy know did gentleman know nothing what

too there be nobody left to trust boy to except be good to bunker for dead wife sake remembered too how have promised to be good to boy not meaning much by word perhaps softened by presence of death be not a if boy be penniless said house will pay for keep to spare will lose nothing by promise again remembered that have promised second time that must be good to boy remembered too how promise seemed then to involve great expense in cane if break solemn promise said with feminine prescience warn that will do injury when grows up remember that did remember now though have quite forgotten detail long while ago boy have returned be grown up must do injury if knew how because only have to ask uncle for account of house fortunately did not know happily there be one to tell with third tumbler mr bunker became quite confident reassured with fourth felt inclined to be merry to slap on back for wide awakedness of rarest kind with fifth resolved to go upstairs tell caroline that unless went told son one must carried part of resolution into effect be to say went to bedroom housekeeper unobserved have pleasure of seeing master ascending stair on hand foot method offer great advantage to gentleman who have have five tumbler of brandy water when got there have quite succeeded in shutting door not always so easy thing a look caroline be no longer visible must not find anywhere though

one of two by confession unconscious self betrayal stand revealed to other be not actual man woman see who be loved be ideal possible model type from specimen be copied distinctly resembles think of danger when house in young people find be not large country house where many be gathered together of like pursuit obscure boarding house in society forgotten suburb where two have only other to talk to add to that be interested in experiment of greatest delicacy in least false step must be fatal add further fact that be astonished at other one to find in dressmaker refinement accomplishment of lady other to find in cabinet maker distinguishing mark of gentleman same way of looking at thing talking about same bearing same courtesy danger be even made greater by what seemed preventive namely by way in at beginning angela so very firmly put down foot on subject of keeping company there be to be attempt at love making on understanding two must did go about together a much a pleased what followed naturally be that more more began to consider other a problem of interesting character angela observed that young workman whom have at first considered of frivolous disposition seemed to be growing more serious in view of thing even when laughed there be method in folly men be so solemn reflected a dull of comprehension perhaps extremely serious character of place in lived be making dull too be difficult certainly for one to go on laughing at child who begin by laughing like child everywhere have to give up practice before be eight year of age because street be so insufferably dull grown up people never laugh at when immigrant arrive from livelier quarter say manchester sheffield after certain time of residence period varies with mercurial temperament of patient laugh more surely thought angela be settling down will soon find work will become like other men of class then doubt will fall in love with nelly nothing must be more suitable by saying to herself over over again that arrangement must take place have got to persuade that certainly must nelly possessed said refinement of manner nature without young man must be wretched be affectionate sensible must certainly do very well be hardly conscious while arranged in own head of certain uneasy feeling in mind in smaller creature might have be called jealousy so far there have be little to warrant belief

servant said with little agitation in voice understood nothing what wish to understand chapter xv splendid offer be strange coincidence that only two day after conversation with miss kennedy harry received first offer of employment came from brewery be in first instance mere note sent by clerk inviting h goslett to call at accountant office at ten in morning name standing bare naked by without preliminary title of respect mister master sieur presented harry thought very miserable appearance perhaps must be difficult to find readier method of insulting man than to hurl own name at head one may understand how louis capet must have felt when thus reduced to plain simplicity what on earth harry asked forgetting trade can want with in business house working men even of gentle craft of cabinet making generally carry with tool sometimes wear apron always have trouser turned up never wear collar using instead red muffler keep throat warmer doe not so readily show effect of london fog smoke also of garment be made of corduroy jacket have bulging pocket hat not unfrequently have pipe stuck into young working man repaired to trysting place in easy attire in be wont to roam about bower of east end be to say looked like carelessly dressed gentleman harry found at office uncle mr bunker who snorted when saw nephew what be doing here asked ca waste time bring disgrace on hard working uncle outside place where be known respected harry sighed few of said sufficiently respect uncle with such uncle ah what more might have passed between know not fortunately at point be summoned to presence of chief accountant knew mr bunker shook hand with be nephew mr bunker asked looking curiously at very handsome young fellow who stood before with careless air yes be nephew at least say so said mr bunker surlily perhaps sir must mind telling what want letting go then can get to business business be with of of mr bunker looked uneasy what business must be in be connected with nephew perhaps have better read portion of letter received by yesterday from miss messenger that portion concern mr bunker be a follows rather remarkable letter have be received at brewery on previous day from miss messenger be remarkable indeed disquieting because showed disposition to interfere in management of great concern interference of young lady in brewery boded chief brewer chief accountant read together be grave elderly pair in sixty who have be regarded by late mr messenger a mere boy for be in eighty said chief brewer a colleague read missive with sigh know what must say be not thing thing be small thing man may even be worth pay be spirit of letter spirit that concern be spirit echoed chief accountant said chief brewer rule here certainly said chief accountant well put if here chief brewer rapped middle knuckle of back of left hand forefinger with tip of right hand forefinger if what then gazed upon other for moment in great sadness having before eye hazy vision in miss messenger walked through brewery putting down mighty lowering salary grateful reward for long faithful service at thought of two servant in own eye became patriarchal a regard length of year spent in brewery long service loomed before a so devoted so faithful a to place above rewarding power of salary chief accountant be tall old gentleman stood in commanding position on hearth rug letter in one hand pair of double eye glass in other will see from what be about to read to mr bunker began that service such a be to late mr messenger will not go unrewarded very good so far what have reward to do with nephew be good deal with mr messenger at one time remember mr bunker be great deal quite so quite so assisted believe with house property tenant so forth did mr bunker cleared throat did often mr messenger must talk of reward be to have when be took left nothing however possibly because forgot ought therefore to be more grateful to miss messenger for remembering particularly a young lady have only heard of by kind of chance have have sent something asked chief accountant smiled graciously have sent very considerable present indeed ah mr bunker finger closed a if be grappling with bank note be asked in trembling accent be check think mr bunker that will like present better than check there can be nothing better than one of miss messenger check replied gallantly nothing in world except perhaps one be bigger suppose be note then listen mr bunker 'considering various service rendered to grandfather by mr bunker with whom believe be acquainted in connection with property in stepney neighborhood be anxious to make substantial present have therefore caused inquiry to be made a to best way of doing learn that have nephew named henry goslett by trade cabinet maker ' here mr bunker made violent effort to suppress emotion 'who be out of employment propose that must be received into brewery that shop with that want must be fitted up for that attend daily until anything better offer to do may be required in trade must wish to be independent a regard time of attendance that must be paid at proper rate for piece work in way hope mr bunker may feel that have received reward more appropriate to friendly relation seem to have existed between grandfather than mere matter of money be glad to be able to gratify in finding honorable employment for one who be trust deserving young man then mr bunker there be why good heaven man what be matter for mr bunker be purple with wrath three time essayed to speak three time failed then put on hat fled precipitately what be matter with asked chief accountant young workman laughed believe replied that uncle expected check well well chief accountant waved hand there be nothing more to be said will

there be also honorable timothy clitheroe davenant who be also supposed to be drowned in reality exercised until death apparently with happiness craft of wheelwright there be unfortunate nobleman well known to fame who became butcher in colony liked precedent enough of voluntary descent eclipse to say nothing of involuntary obscurations a when migr have to teach dancing son of royal duke be fain to

have be brought up to profession in republican school of thought did not set up above neighbor yet respect to rank must be conceded be expected in general too be talkative enlivened tedium of work with many anecdote illustrating canaan city way showing lethargic manner of davenants husband to say nothing of grandfather contented with lowly occupation of wheelwright while might have soared to british house of lord morning however sat down be silent head drooped angela who sat next watched presently observed that tear formed in eye dropped upon work that lip moved a if be holding

day buckwheat cake such oh change of diet must bring down luxury increase pride angela thought that starvation be new way of developing pride of birth did not say so be there way asked in can earn money shook head a teacher be generally allowed to be learned sleepy in city however boy girl did expect too much be sleepy place in winter sit round stove go to sleep in summer sit in shade go to sleep be sleepiest place in state there be kind o ' way in can earn money if there be did ever hear of british peer working for daily bread lady davenant surely ladyship must not mind if chance offered if be thing kept secret if not even husband knew must not object to earning something week to find square meal husband so naturally desire ladyship held out hand without word angela in shameful contempt of political economy placed in work have in own whispered have better said take week in advance then can arrange with mr bormalack for usual meal on old term if must rather come here to work can have room to yourself morning thank lady davenant obligation be entirely mine know for really more delicate work more beautiful work never saw do american lady work so beautifully ladyship quite overcome with honeyed word took work made reply only one thing dear lady davenant angela went on smiling must promise not to work too hard know that such work a yours be worth at least twice a

have taken in hand be ostentatiously rolled up laid on table a if packed ready for departure by next mail wife regarded with mixture of affection contempt must sell crown of england murmured for roast turkey apple fixin davenants must have be always like that must be mother blood yet be church member walked consistent did not wake up sought out mr bormalack presently there be transfer of coin resurrection of smile doux parler that fairy of sweet speech who cover hide beneath cold wind of poverty tell mr goslett said angela that evening still thinking over sad lot of claimant tell have examined claim of people what chance have must say none then what make so confident of success hush listen be really confident noble lordship perfectly understands weakness of claim depends upon pure assumption a will hear a for little lady wife have long since jumped to conclusion that assumption requires proof therefore save in moment of dejection be pretty confident then be hopelessly ignorant of how must proceed of necessary delay even if case be unanswerable thought have only to cross ocean send in statement in order to get admitted to rank privilege of peerage believe think that queen will in mysterious way restore property to poor thing yes be rather sad to think of such magnificent expectation besides really be most beautiful case last lord davenant have one son that only son grew up have quarrel with father sailed from port of bristol bound for american port forget ship be ever heard of again therefore title became extinct well very good now story begin name be timothy clitheroe davenant name always given to eldest son of family now friend name be timothy clitheroe davenant so be father so be grandfather be very strange be very strange what be stranger still be that grandfather be born according to date on tomb same year a lost heir at same place davenant where be family seat can there have be two of same name born in same place in same year seems improbable almost impossible moreover last lord have brother have father second lord found that out at herald college consequently even if there be branch birth of two timothy in same year be certain must not get title so that one hope be to be able to prove what call 'connection be to say identity of lost heir with wheelwright seems very doubtful thing to do after year be absolutely impossible unless document be discovered prove nothing remains of wheelwright book paper nothing except small book of song supposed to be convivial with name on inside cover written in sprawling hand misspelt with two v 'davvenant above name in same hand day of week in be written beatturday with two t christian name doe not seem a if absence of christian name must point to assumption of title yes know have not yet told be however very small point quite insufficient in to establish anything yes angela mused be thinking whether something must not be done to help poor people settle case decisively for one way other what be to be end of harry shrugged shoulder who know how long can go on when there be more dollar must go home again hear have got supply of money mr bormalack have be paid for fortnight in advance after be gone perhaps have better go too seems pity said angela slightly reddening at mention of money that research must not be made so a to throw little light upon strange coincidence of name must want to know first what to look for after must have to find man to conduct search then must have to pay a for man there be professor a for place first there be herald college secondly there be parish register of village of davenant a for money why must not cost much believe something might be advanced for if mr goslett between be to pay professor expense must go about for seemed to assume that be quite ready to join in giving money for object yet harry be now living having refused guardian proffered allowance on pay by piece gave a already stated tenpence for working hour must professor cost asked professor be down upon luck said harry be so hard up at present that believe must get for nothing expense eighteen shilling week must buy outright until engagement begin again if there be travelling expense of course must be extra village of davenant be not great way off be situated in essex essex be now suburb of london original name having be east end seaxas be not generally known very well replied gravely must be only nine shilling apiece say eleven hour of extra work for probably must not last long more than week two will give two hour day to lordship harry made wry face laughed young person have begun by turning into journeyman cabinet maker be now making work extra time what next be not slave miss kennedy o mr goslett thought there be to be no more nonsense of kind know can lead to nothing even if desired that must even miss kennedy ca see can see nothing will hear nothing o mr goslett have be be such excellent friend have be so great help to look to for so much more spoil seek for what must never be pray pray spoke with so much earnestness eye be filled with frankness laid hand upon arm with so charming camaraderie that must not choose obey be truly wonderful said thinking for thousandth time how pearl among woman came to stepney green what be wonderful blushed a asked know what mean let be frank command not to say thing most desire to say very good will be content to wait under one promise what be that if reason reason command silence must ever be removed mind seek to know what be will yourself what asked blushing sweetly will yourself tell so recovered composure gave hand if at time can listen to will tell so doe that content certainly not there be more to be got therefore harry be fain to be contented whether must not be only one of hundred little skirmish in endeavored to capture advanced fort prepared to lay siege in form always be routed with heavy loss now went on will get back to professor yes be to work two extra hour day that may go about in luxury of eighteen shilling week be to be one of horny handed what be professor to do first let said find secure service have be seen that professor be already come to period of waist tightening naturally follows too continued succession of banyan day listened with avidity to proposition held forth prospect of food work said only partly understanding must be difficult therefore more to be desired common conjurer said must spoil case a for must undertake to do just whatever wanted with register whether be substitution of page tearing out of page under very eye of parish clerk there must be said patter suitable to occasion will manage for be afraid ca make up a ought for part because must cost too much must do without now miss kennedy what be exactly that want to do be disappointed on learning that there must be palming of leaf old new among register nothing in fact simple journey simple examination of book though a confessed have a yet experience in art of falsifying parish register where science be concerned interest be above of mere morality chapter xxii daniel fagg what must have happened if certain thing have not happened be question be seldom set on examination paper on account of great scope offer to imaginative faculty know how dangerous thing be to develop side of human mind many severe historian have be spoiled by developing imagination for scott might have be alison thackeray mill in stepney business appearance of angela certainly worked change at once remarkable impossible to be dissociated from name thus for unfortunate claimant

of egyptian department must feel for short balance of sin laden day took seat on bench in green garden with view a thought leaned forward staring into vacancy in face there grew so dark expression of despair terror that angela shuddered ran for hat recollecting that have heard of poverty disappointment be afraid be not well mr fagg started looked up in imagination be already lying dead at bottom of green water before troubled mind there be floating confused image of former life now past dead gone saw in australian cottage arriving at grand discovery be lecturing about on platform be standing on deck of ship drinking farewell nobblers with enthusiastic crowd be wandering hungry neglected despised about stony street of london well be not well replied presently understanding thing little be

wheelwright by trade who can be grandfather of poor old friend fear must be so said angela saturday davenant remember little book yes said little book came into mind at once not doubt added professor why stand to reason fellow found long way from england among stranger with money only trade what be to prevent from pretending to be one of family whose name bore at same time said harry with reserve never seems to have asserted that be son of lord davenant only threw out ambiguous word fired imagination of son christened by name of lost heir pretended that be own christian name be not until found out that be hereditary name that claim be thought of poacher striker seems to have possessed considerable native talent what asked angela be to do let hing miss kennedy have secret may keep for present meantime case be hopeless on account of absolute impossibility of connecting wheelwright with man supposed to have be drowned let go on 'enjoying ' title ignorant of existence of unlucky saturday davenant so for present thing be hidden away nothing be said about though about time professor gave one two entertainment in drawing room can not suppose that silence be bought must be unjust to noble profession of be member to think that must let out secret have not miss kennedy paid for performance indeed professor be extremely honorable man must have scorned to betray confidence be good to miss kennedy to find out that evening of magic miracle must do girl good profound pity seized heart of angela poor people who believed to be entitled to english peerage who be so mistaken who must be so disappointed who be so ignorant who knew so little what be claimed must not something be done to lessen disappointment to break fall pondered long over difficulty that must in end have to return to own country be thing about there must be doubt that must return with knowledge of reality of thing have claimed what meant what involved splendor obligation seemed to very great pity little experience thought even glimpse of life led by best bred most highly cultivated richest people in england must be of so much advantage to that must show own unfitness for rank assumed claimed presently arrived at project put into execution without delay what be will presently see chapter xxiv lord jocelyn trouble a season advanced autumn deepened into winter angela found that there be certain social duty be impossible altogether to escape fiction of country house be good enough for general world for more intimate friend cousin must not do for long therefore while kept fact of present occupation place of residence secret from except constance woodcote now unsympathizing must not wholly shut off from old circle among others there be one lady whose invitation be in sense bound to accept what obligation be who lady be belong in way to history be to say explanation belongs to angela simple chronicle of old day when be only miss messenger heiress presumptive of great brewery therefore need not concern suffice to say that be lady in society that gave great dinner held other gathering be at time properly awake to attraction young beautiful wealthy angela messenger lent to reception on occasion constance woodcote among others be invited to meet old friend came be ungracious angela felt more than have expected how great already be gulf between old day of newnham life of active practical work six month before such coldness must have hurt pained now hardly felt yet constance meant to demonstrate by becoming frost of manner how grievous be disappointment about scholarship then there be dozen men unmarried men men in society men of club men who felt strongly that possession of miss messenger million might reconcile to matrimony be much interested by possibility of introduction to came away disappointed because got nothing out of not even encouragement to talk everybody said that be singularly cold distraite even embarrassed that evening who have heard that miss messenger be young lady of great conversational power went away cynically supposing that young lady with le than half money must achieve same reputation at same cost of energy reason of coldness preoccupation be a follows dinner party be large conversation by mean general so far a angela be concerned be held entirely with man who took down name be lord jocelyn le breton rugged faced man with pleasing manner agreeable voice no longer young talked to good deal in light irresponsible vein a if mattered very little what said so that amused young lady discoursed about many thing principally about dinner asking angela what be own view a to dinner expostulating with feminine contempt for subject dinner said must be like separate distinct work of art must be contrived for different kind of wine there must be champagne dinner for instance light composed of many dish of substantial there must be claret dinner grave conscientious burgundy dinner of few course solid german wine dinner in only simplest plate must appear unto harmony consistency in dining have not yet arrived perhaps miss messenger may be induced to bring intellect to bear upon subject hear took high honor at newnham lately laughed do too much honor to intellect lord jocelyn at newnham teach political economy have not trusted with art of dining do know positively did not care much what have for dinner ward harry used to say forget if ever met think not what be name well used to bear name everybody knew a harry le breton have right to because be relation of mine so gave up took own oh angela

miss messenger be not dead be only dead to society have gone out of world have returned to in fact native rank in life angela reddened what must mean interest lord jocelyn do say that ward have voluntarily given up society everything thought of herself for moment also vaguely of harry goslett for although knew that young man have refused kind of offer included idleness have never connected in mind quite with own rank station how must be only cabinet maker whose resemblance to gentleman have learned to accept without further wonder gave up everything laughed over took header into mob just a if be going to enjoy plunge did not hear of everybody talked about story got into society journal people blamed for telling truth have not be in london much year therefore heard nothing said angela just then dinner came to end will tell more about ward lord jocelyn asked a left word have raised in mind vague uncertain anxiety hour later came to side room by time be full angela be surrounded made room for lord jocelyn presently others dropped away must talk young lady began too long very brilliant piece of music under cover of everybody must talk do really want to hear trouble about harry asked look very sympathetic young lady perhaps will feel for see brought up in ignorance of father whom always imagined to be gentleman whereas be only sergeant in line regiment what be miss messenger for became suddenly white in cheek must there be two harrys son of sergeant who have taken downward plunge mere wonderful than pair of timothy clitheroes be nothing lord jocelyn pray go on adopted son then have always resolved to tell about people when be twenty three who must have thought however that must take a did forget that have not told what did do if be to sympathize must tell a far a world know went away on leave so to speak perhaps be only on leave after be long leave look more like desertion be mysterious lord jocelyn be curious miss messenger say be sympathetic tell a much a can about ward lord jocelyn looked in listener face yes there be sympathy in interest a phrenologist say largely developed then will explain to miss messenger how boy did most remarkable unexpected thing paused moment considering imagine boy whom have taken away from own people at three thereabouts so that must never know anything of at dream about yearn know anything of kind orphan too with nothing uncle bunker be inconceivable get on said angela in great impatience yet relieved to find from reference to worthy friend bunker that there be only one harry what be inconceivable be coming to gave boy best education must get for be so eager apt that taught more than must be taught if saw anybody doing thing well be never satisfied till must do a well not better mark cad might have wanted to do better gentleman be content to do a well a other gentleman there be hardly anything must not do there be nobody who did not love be favorite in society have host of friend nobody cared who be father what did matter a put to said 'look at so so so so who be father who care who asks ' yet when learned truth broke away gave up went back to own relation to whitechapel angela blushed again lip trembled little than said softly to whitechapel be very interesting to because lord jocelyn belong to whitechapel do might a well have said that belonged to seven dial in fact much better because in young day corinthian day lord jocelyn have often repaired to seven dial to see noble sportsman chez ben caunt rat killing cock fighting many other beautiful form of sport do really do belong to remarkable part of london certainly grandfather did know lord jocelyn shook head have brewery know messenger marsden company in whitechapel be born there always called whitechapel man seemed to be proud of so that in common filial respect too must be proud of be in fact whitechapel granddaughter doe not seem to help unlucky harry give one little more sympathy perhaps said be know so very useful possession yes did not seem to recognize usefulness a regard ward well went to whitechapel with light heart must look round make acquaintance of own people then must come back again must go on just a usual at least did not exactly say understood so because seemed impossible that man who have once lived in society among ourselves formed one of must ever dream of living down there angela laughed from superior knowledge of down there laughed went away be left without for first time for twenty year be pretty dull said must give thing trial wrote to that be trying that be not so bad a seemed yet talked a if experiment must be short one left there went away for cruise in mediterranean when came home returned to did return then yes came back one evening good deal changed must not have thought possible for boy to change so much in so short time be ill fed have suffered privation apparently be changed be more thoughtful smile laugh be not so ready poor boy lord jocelyn sighed heavily angela sympathy grew deeper for evidently loved boy what have done then came to say farewell to thanked for know what good honest lad must say told that have offer made to of unexpected nature have determined to accept see be clever fellow with finger can play paint carve do sort of thing among various art accomplishment know how to turn lathe so have become joiner cabinet maker told that have got appointment in great factory work something a cabinet maker in ordinary what be name harry goslett goslett goslett here blushed again once more made play with fan have got relation certain mr bunker why yes told uncle bunker then remember name lord jocelyn hope will be grateful to because have be humble mean of procuring distinguished post mr bunker in fact be conceived that have be useful to grandfather be said to be disappointed at getting nothing by will therefore endeavored to make return by taking nephew into house be great deal more than enough because miss messenger have out of kindness done great mischief for if have not employed be quite certain one else must then must have to come back to send away do send away do send away miss messenger there be lot of cabinet maker to be have then will come back to society will present to will thank smiled shook head people be never sent away from brewery so long a behave properly be strange indeed that ward must voluntarily surrender advantage of life social position for hard work poor pay of artisan be be affection for cousin blushed deeply a put question strange indeed when came to other night told long story about men being alike in rank of life have noticed much same thing in army of course did not have impudence to say that woman be alike talked quantity of prodigious nonsense about living among own people presently however got out of real truth what be that confessed that be in love with young lady of whitechapel doe great credit to excellent education gave lord jocelyn blushed for fourth fifth time wondered why held fan before face perhaps added be wrong woman of rank like men be same perhaps ought not to have told miss messenger now will despise yet have impudence to say that

of tenpence hour if will not send away then oh then quick lord jocelyn what be tax resource of brewery put on odd twopence be gift of samaritan make shilling hour will lord jocelyn music be just over hope that dressmaker will relent there will be wedding in stepney church that will be happy ever after o brave loyal lover give up looked round room room filled with guest great eye became limpid voice fell to murmur for love for love do think lord jocelyn that dressmaker will continue to be obdurate perhaps doe not know can not suspect what have thrown away for sake happy dressmaker think said lord jocelyn afterward that if harry have seen miss messenger before saw dressmaker must have heard so much about beautiful life of working man why devil must wait girl be helen of troy harry

lord davenant received outside recognition so to speak of rank be true that one within mile of stepney green be anywhere between aldgate pump bow church must have have hardihood to express doubt on

fell upon pillow there be knock at door be maid who came to say that have forgotten to tell ladyship that dinner be at eight cried poor lady startled out of dignity do mean to say that have got to have dinner certainly lady young person be extremely well behaved in presence of master mistress superior knew not nature of smile ladyship standing at door looked first at maid without then at

luncheon be great meal dinner be far more magnificent stately only there be two footman instead of one lordship felt that must not do justice to dinner dinner deserved because two great hulking fellow in livery watched time after dinner sat in great drawing room feeling very magnificent yet uncomfortable second dinner said lordship in half whisper made feel clara martha that did right to leave canaan city never before knew what really meant by enjoying title think ever thoroughly enjoyed before red mullet be beautiful little lark in paper basket made feel lord over chapter xxvii same sign have done for love when angela returned to dressmakery be with word ringing in ear like refrain continually return will not be silenced have done for love be great deal to do great deal to give up fully realized after talk with lord jocelyn how much be that have given up at request what have done asked in comparison have given money anybody must give money have lived in disguise under false pretence for few month never intended to go on living in east end after have set association on firm basis to be sure have be drawn on into wider scheme must not retire until including palace of delight be well started young man have given up cheerfully for sake because be dressmaker lived at stepney must be workman live there a well for sake have given up for ever life of ease culture might have be among gentlefolk to whom belonged for sake left man who stood to in loco parentis for sake gave up thing be dear to young men became servant without murmur watched going to work in morning cheerful with sunshine ever in face in fact sunshine lived there head erect eye fearless not repenting at of choice perhaps hopeful that in long run impediment spoken of might be removed in hope lived must that hope be disappointed what then only to have loved to have sacrificed so much for sake of love angela said to herself thinking of something have read be enough then laughed because be so silly young man deserved to have reward then a first result of newly acquired knowledge point of view seemed changed quite naturally after first surprise at finding so much cultivation in working man regarded like rest from own elevated platform in same way from own elevation have be in sense looking down upon though did not suspect fact one might pause here in order to discus how many kind of people do consider on higher level than neighbor own opinion be that man think on so very high platform a to entitle to consider greater part of mankind quite below fact that one else think so have nothing to do with one however can understand how angela must at first regard harry harry fair dressmaker further that acquaintance intimacy grew up between first impression must always remain with mental attitude of slight superiority in mind so long a first impression first belief a to real fact be not removed now that be removed on one side angela for part must no longer look down there be superiority left except in so far a daughter of whitechapel brewer might consider herself of finer clay than son of sergeant in army also of whitechapel origin for love of word filled heart made cheek burn eye glow seemed so great noble thing to do so grand sacrifice to make remembered word of contempt when in shamefaced hesitating way a if be something wrong have confessed that might go back to life of idleness why might have known ought to have known that be not to ignoble life among ignoble people that must go yet be so stupid what sacrifice to make for love of then flower of love sprang up immediately blossomed be beauteous rose ready for lover to gather place upon heart a yet hardly knew yet have known all along harry loved never tried to conceal passion why said to herself trying to understand meaning of sudden change in why only seemed to amuse thing be absurd felt pity for little anger because be so presumptuous be little embarrassed for fear have compromised with be absurd at love though have fortune oh heaven be dive doe know love same be to tell when impediment be removed why be removed already must tell how must dare to tell girl like to do own wooing must be courted must be won besides perhaps here smiled be not so very much in love after perhaps must change perhaps must grow tired go home desert perhaps must fall in love with one else perhaps angela strong minded student of newnham who must have love marriage anything of kind in life be stronger than of sister at approach of love unconquered came back evening after dinner cheek have new color upon there be new smile upon lip there be new softness in eye look so beautiful evening said nelly have be happy while be away have heard something have made happier said angela dear nelly have not why be cheek so pale what be meaning of dark line under eye be nothing girl replied quickly be quite well be not be nervous preoccupied there be something on mind then harry came began to pas evening in usual way practising song with music little dance without girl must not have gone away happy angela for first time observed thing struck chill to heart robbed of half joy why have never before discovered thing ah ignorant maiden despite wisdom of school hypatia be not more ignorant than angela who knew not that chief quality of rose of love in heart be to make read heart of others armed with magic power saw what might have seen long before in hasty glance quick flush nervous trembling of hand poor nelly betrayed secret by sign other girl who loved same man read that secret o selfish woman said angela heart be happiness to be bought at cost girl of lower nature might have be jealous angela be not seemed to sin in nelly that thought too much of such man pitied did a woman might have done suspect that harry have trifled with feeling knew that have not have seen together day after day knew what bearing have always be toward frank courteous brotherly called by christian name liked presence be pleasant be pretty sweet winning did not suspect yet what must say to poor girl how comfort how reconcile to inevitable sorrow nelly whispered at parting if be unhappy child must tell what be can not nelly replied oh think about miss kennedy be not worth perhaps too have read same sign knew what meant chapter xxviii harry find liberty mention have be made of stepney advanced club where dick coppin thundered burning question be discussed debate held on high political point where more idea be submitted more project set forth in single year than in rest of london in two year member of advanced club be mostly young men there be sprinkling among of grizzled beard who remembered dream of chartism have got by time pretty well clamored for in by gone day when thought of remembered how everything be to go well a soon a five point of charter be carried how thing still remained in same upside down topsy turvy one sided muddle headed perverseness just a if point have not be carried became sad nevertheless habit of demanding remained because reformer be like daughter of horse leech still cry for more yet have le confidence than of old in reformer great nostrum of destruction younger men of course be quite sure absolutely sure that with little more upsetting down pulling balance must be set right beautiful straight level of universal happiness must be reached angela heard from time to time of meeting of club harry told how cousin dick have surpassed how be going to abolish crown church house of lord with landlordism lawyer established army pauperdom divesdom tax kind of thing hateful tory pitiful creature moderate liberal considers necessary for welfare of state knew that harry went there spoke occasionally that have made in quiet way sort of mark among member one evening about time met dick coppin returning from work in unlike cousin did not disdain apron box of tool there be going to be debate on sunday said half shyly half boastfully at club be on abolition of house of lord be going to speak if like to come one two of girl will pas in will hear thing two will open eye be very good of mr coppin always like to have eye opened will there be many speaker there will be replied with simple grandeur think when have said say that there will remain much more to be said by anybody cousin harry may get up perhaps face assumed little uneasiness think will find hole in have got fact have gone to right quarter to get ca deny fact very well mr coppin perhaps will go to hear be very sure about fact angela said nothing about proposed debate intention of being present learned from harry that there really be going to be field night that dick coppin be expected to come out in more than usual strength informant said nothing about own intention indeed have none be falling into habit of spending hour two at club on sunday evening before finishing off with girl sometimes spoke oftener listened came away silent reflected advanced club offered ample material for one who know how to reflect humanity be grand subject in fact be only subject left for epic poem perhaps action must drag here harry saw be body of men old young firmly persuaded that thing be wrong that thing might be made better yet casting about blindly for remedy cry aloud for leader who desired to lead have nothing to offer stone instead of bread fact that young man did listen reflect show how greatly be changed from whom first met in prologue regular hour simple living reasonably hard work strengthened nerve for anything be harder men with whom talked be rougher old carelessness be gone kept gayety of heart be sobered felt responsible knew so much more than men around that felt consuming desire to set right must not for be tongue tied have not yet found liberty a old preacher used to say when felt most strongly that speaker be on false track spoke most feebly wanted to be prophet there be only confused idea blurred perception to work upon now first step toward being prophet be most laudable ambition be to see quite clearly one self to understand what one mean must set man right a to fact must shut up speaker make club laugh must not move a yet harry be only in position occupied during long life by late prophet of chelsea inasmuch a distinctly perceived folly of neighbor must teach way of wisdom be form of prophetical utterance have never possessed much weight with people want direct teaching leader who know what mean whither must conduct if be only in direction of one of poor old worn out panacea once warranted to guarantee universal happiness like ballot box not that harry grew miserable over failure to prophesy not at all only wished for word of wisdom power sat meanwhile with hand in pocket hat pulled over eye like minister in house of common while member of club poured frothy declamation louder than predecessor trying to catch applause of assembly generally shouted for loudest time might be out of joint harry felt inspiration a to way of setting right if thing came to must say if not must wait great secret about waiting be that while man wait think if think in solitude wait long enough letting word lie in brain listening to idea come upon sometimes singly slowly sometimes in crowd like fancy of wakeful night there present idea at last seizes upon hold captive work out in brain while mechanically go on with work rest toil pleasure of daily life solitary work be favorable to meditation therefore while harry be shaping thing at lathe undisturbed by one brain be at work thought came to lay there dimly perceived at first growing larger daily till filled head drew unto other thought so that everything saw read heard meditated upon became like rill rivulet go to swell great river be thought growing into shape at last proclaimed to member of advanced club on night of great debate be not large hall be perfectly filled with people chiefly be men young men among be good many woman girl doe ever occur to better class that work of woman emancipation be advancing in certain circle with rapid stride be so nevertheless large if not pleasant result may be expected in few year therefrom must be remembered that for most part start perfectly free from trammel of religion have be stated that basis of philosophy be always will be axiom one must get a much a possible for out of rather limited ration of pleasure supplied to humanity whether be true know not angela watched woman with curiosity be mostly young of be pretty there be absolutely nothing to show that thought differently from other woman of have brought work be talking be not excited by prospect of coming debate expected in fact nothing more than have already heard over over again there be too much gas atmosphere be already heavy wall already shiny before meeting began on platform be chair for chairman with table hammer decanter of water glass angela sat far back against door with captain sorensen nelly be silent wondering at people why must trouble about house of lord whether never felt desire at for religion brings joy happiness to so many suffering life presently saw harry walk slowly up middle aisle take place for there be chair on step led to platform be so far back that must not see for afterward be glad chairman man stricken in year with gray hair grizzled beard one of ex chartist of whom have spoken took chair hammered table opened debate be man of great reputation having be life irreconcilable be suspected of being socialist be certainly red republican began in usual way by stating a axiom that people can do wrong to intrust destiny of nation to people be to insure greatness that manhood be only rank so forth in capital letter with note of admiration word be strong produced effect because speech have be made before great many time people knew by heart therefore though be right thing to say thing expected of chairman nobody paid attention discussion be one sided then began two three young men rose one after other be listened to with indulgence be always accorded to beginner none of made point said good thing went outside theory of untaught if generous youth ignorance be such a to make angela almost weep then dick coppin mounted platform advanced amid plaudit of expectant audience ran finger through coarse black hair straightened up to full height of five foot six drank little water then standing beside chairman table with right hand resting upon when be not waving about began slowly at first afterward with fluent speech strong word ringing voice harangue have so carefully prepared of course condemned house of lord nail must be destroyed root branch be standing insult to common sense of nation be effete worn out institution against enlightenment of age cried out aloud be obstruction to progress be menace to people be thing of past be enemy of working man be tyrant who have will not power to tyrannize longer be toothless old wolf who must bark must not bite free enlightened men sitting before member of advanced club have pronounced doom therefore must go time have come when nation must endure no longer to have privileged class must be mocked more by ridiculous spectacle of hereditary legislator pursued topic with great freedom of language great eloquence of rough uncultivated kind hearer getting gradually warmed interrupted by plaudit go straight to heart of born orator stir to strongest best then changed line attempted to show that family compose upper house be a well a institution worn out used up lost to vigor first pushed to front where be now fighting men asked where be orator among be of real importance to party of have in modern time done anything proposed anything thought of anything for advancement of knowledge good of people not one able man said among luxury have ruined corrupted blood be poisoned must drink eat must practise other luxurious habit enumerated with fidelity lest there must be mistake about matter then must go to house reeling into drunk with wine oppose will of people then turned from generality to particular entertained audience with anecdote gleaned heaven know how from private history of many noble family tending to show corruption into british aristocracy have fallen anecdote be received with keenness always awaits story show how wicked other people be be newest fashion hitherto unknown form of vice angela marvelled on part to hear scandal about queen elizabeth at stepney then after impeachment lasted for hour thundered forth appeal not at novel to hearer yet still effective because voice be like trumpet to men before to rise in million majesty might to bear accursed thing down sat down at last wiping forehead exhausted triumphant never before have so completely carried audience with never before have obtained such flow of language such mastery over voice never before have realized so fully that be orator inferior to none a sat down while men clapped hand cheered vision of greatness passed before mind must be leader of people must look to a have never yet looked to man for guidance must lead whither in dream of moment mattered nothing cold chill came over a saw cousin harry leap lightly to platform take place at table for foresaw trouble more because of audience who knew gentleman jack laughed in expectation of trouble fickle fleeting be breath of popular favor only moment before be cheering to sky now laughed because hoped be to be made to look fool orator took heart considering that fact be undeniable when tumult have subsided harry to everybody astonishment laid hand upon cousin shoulder gesture of approbation looked round room said quietly loud enough to be heard by cousin dick coppin can talk be very good speech of be voice be heard asking if must better harry replied ca wish must took place beside table gazed for few moment at face below angela observed that face be pale though carriage of head be brave wish repeated must because after firework be such

with dancing music come here to tell that be one of instrument of devil in wicked town have really come here mr coppin on purpose to tell that that said be part of message do think asked angela

of saturday religion mission angela interrupted be not be sure to argue about sect come mr coppin now that have told who be what be profession why come here might like to preach to do so if will be sitting here quietly when came interrupt nothing so that if must really make feel happier may preach to for few minute looked about in hesitation kind of preaching be not in line loved vast hall with thousand face looking at crowd of turbulent rough ready to answer message with volley of brickbat chance gathering of unrepentant sinner in wide thoroughfare must lift up voice to to preach in quiet room to dozen girl be new experience be not place have expected brother in last interview have thrown in teeth house doings a offering more reasonable solution of life problem than own want everybody said to join in singing preaching day what must do when there be nobody left to preach at now there what say be 'let make ourselves comfortable ' there be deal in come to think of look at girl now while happy elizas be trampin ' in mud with flag procession gettin ' black eye brickbat be singin ' laughin ' dancin ' makin ' what fun can for seems to tom that if kind of thing get fashionable army will be played out well have come to see place have offered pleasure instead of repentance a method of improving life be not laughing singing at there be men present except one old gentleman in blue coat with brass button to be sure have fiddle lying on chair beside there be indication of red cup smell of tobacco now pleasure without drink tobacco singing have be in tom unregenerate day incomprehensible must rather said dick see army of miss kennedy girl than army of hallelujah poll yet seemed perfectly quiet make happy tom first said dick who be still thinking over harry speech a possible point of departure happiness be not word in dictionary of men like tom coppin know what mean know spree understand drink know misery because be round misery of hunger of disease of intemperance of dirt of evil temper of violence misery sin of one bring sin of upon indeed need not go to whitechapel to find out misery know not happiness for such a captain coppin there be a alternative for misery choice of glory what mean by glory be ecstasy rapture mystery of emotional religion believe be most advanced who be most often hysterical dick like many of follower yearned honestly unselfishly to extend rapture so often enjoyed that there must be other way out of misery save by way of humble stool of conviction be thing must not understand happiness calm peace content sweet enjoyment of innocent recreation thing knew nothing of have not come way have come have seen no doubt moment back be turned orgy must begin have delivered message have warned young woman who have led girl calm cold woman who looked at with curiosity be so unmoved by what said might go with whole heart have spoken have so far moved one except daughter of seventh day independent only little kind of thing be very irritating suppose be to put red hot poker into jug of water without producing steam hissing at how a natural philosopher must feel may preach to if like said miss kennedy sat before resting chin upon hand knew that be beautiful although woman face grace sweet look played part at in thought felt without putting thing into word that be beautiful also that regarded with kind of contempt a well a curiosity also that have determined not to be moved by anything might say also that relied on own influence over girl felt for moment a if trusty arm be dropping from hand whole armor be slipping from shoulder not beauty fifty helen of troy must not have moved young apostle position a impregnable outsider for against curious outsider who regard captain in salvation army only a so many interesting result of growing civilization officer be powerless indeed if there be real difference between working man of england man who doe other work be that former be generally emotional latter be not to man of emotion thing can not be stated too strongly leader be who have greatest command of adjective be singularly open to charm of eloquence like audacity of statement like to be moved by wrath pity terror have eye for shade of color when be most moved think be most right be make so angry with people who can not be moved be one of person who can not be moved by ordinary method looked at tom a if be strange creature watching what did listening to what said a if be not like unto be not quite fair way of describing angela attitude of mind be near enough represents what passed through brain of salvation captain will preach to repeated third time mechanically opened hymn book number three hundred sixty two said quietly sang hymn by at top of voice so that window rattled to one of rousing popular melody have be pressed into service of army be in fact molly darling people at stepney green asked other in wonder if meeting of salvation army be actually being held at miss kennedy when have finished hymn began to preach stammered at first because surroundings be strange besides cold curious eye of miss kennedy chilled presently however recovered possession began address there be one merit at least possessed by preacher be that of simplicity else may be be always same even word vary while there be one idea if want to influence dull of comprehension such a common donkey there be one way possible can not be led coaxed persuaded must be thwacked father stick explains make apparent instantly what logic of school have failed to prove in same way if wish to awaken spiritual emotion among people who have hitherto be strange to chance be not by argument by appeal statement prophecy threat terror picture in fact do exactly correspond produce same effect a father stick be so many knock down blow belabor terrify preacher began girl composed to listen with exception of rebekah who went on with work ostentatiously partly to show disapproval of such irregular proceeding partly a one who having got truth from independent source being already advanced in narrow way have occasion for captain persuasion be one thing to hear voice of street preacher in own church so to speak be on curbstone quite thing to hear same man same person in quiet room tom coppin have only one sermon though dressed up sometimes not often in new word yet be relieved of monotony by earnestness poured into believed in that go long way angela began by thinking of doctrine presently turned attention to preacher began to think what manner of man be personally be pale thin with strong black hair like brother eye be singularly bright here be man of people self taught profoundly ignorant a to many problem of life solution filled however with noble sympathy make prophet poet martyr wholly possessed of faith in narrow creed owning authority of church priest believing under direct divine guidance chosen called instrument of merciful heaven to drag guilty soul from pit consciously standing a servant day night before throne other men regard afar off can not see at actually living life of hardship privation ill treatment preached for sake of others enduring hardness poverty contumely taking thing a part parcel of day work in name of duty searching into corner hole of great town for vilest most hardened most depraved most blinded to higher life if please be not thing to be laughed at what did wesley more what did whitfield nay what did paul paid for service be true gave five twenty shilling week of great sum gave away rest provided with poor simple food have pleasure joy of life have recreation have hope of pleasure of officer of army being men woman a well a preacher loved other be married man have thought of such thing a much a monk be vowed to service of master without rest holiday other joy than of doing work lay before great pity sympathy filled angela heart a thought of thing man before be for moment prophet mattered nothing that creed be narrow truth only half truth doctrine commonplace language in bad taste manner vulgar faith of man covered up hid defect have message to mankind be delivering message to be fresh new message never before intrusted to man have to deliver perpetually even though went in starvation angela heart softened a realized loyalty of man saw softening in eye thought be first sign of conviction be not meantime if angela be thinking of preacher girl of course with exception of rebekah be trembling at word suddenly unexpected change be kind of rhetorical trick often proved effective preacher ceased to denounce threaten spoke of pardon peace called upon in softer voice in accent full of tear love to break down pride to hear voice called know well enough what said only know how said angela looked about room captain sat with hand on knee face dutifully lifted to angle denotes attention expression be unmoved evidently captain be not open to conviction a for girl might be divided into class have listened to threat warning though have heard often enough before now however of seemed a if be impatient a if with little encouragement must break into scoffing others be cry one two be steadfastly regarding speaker a if have mesmerized among be nelly eye be fixed lip be parted breathing be quick cheek be pale great wonderful be power of eloquence there be few orator ex printer uneducated man of rank be like brother born with gift be so rare must have be taken away taught kept from danger properly fed cared for now be too late said of in connection that be blessed in saving of most stubborn most hardened when fell under magic of presence voice be broken subdued what wonder that weak girl must give way when paused looked round noted face of whom have mesmerized raised arm pointed to nelly

ashamed of transaction must fain have remain unknown solution accounted seemed to account for great wrath agitation when subject be mentioned out of mischievous delight in making uncle angry harry frequently alluded to point story of house be better solution still accounted for mr bunker agitation a well a wrath wrath terror appeared to harry to corroborate very strongly old man story longer thought about more strongly believed harry asked landlady whether in opinion if mr maliphant made statement that statement be to be accepted a true mr bormalack replied that a never made statement except in reference to event long since thing of past be impossible for to say whether be true not that memory be clean gone for thing of present so of to day yesterday knew nothing that thought be always running on old day when must be heard right through without dropping voice at sometimes told very interesting curious thing board lodging be paid for by grandson most respectable gentleman dockmaster that a to old man business have none have have none for many year being clean forgotten although did go day to yard stayed there day long harry thought must pay visit perhaps something more must be remembered went there again in morning street at end of be yard be a quiet a on sunday child being at school men at work great gate be closed locked small side door be unlocked when opened figurehead turned quickly anxiously to look at at least harry declares did spiritualist will readily believe be asked going to take one of away stick on bow of great ship send up down upon face of ocean to four corner of world have be made for active life pined away in inactivity fig for danger of deep from saucy sal to neptune asked same question in same hope harry shook head sighed sadly resumed sadly former position a be eye front waiting till night must fall old man must go must talk with other thought harry be strange ghostly place know old creepy feeling caused by presence albeit unseen of ghost one may feel anywhere at time in church at theatre in bed at night by broad daylight in darkness in twilight be in sunshine of bright december day last day of year be singularly bright gracious place be dark chamber gloomy vault broad open yard cheerfully decorated with carved figurehead yet even here harry experienced touch of ghostliness place be so strange that did not astonish at to see old man suddenly appear in door of doll house waving hand smiling cheerily a one who speed parting guest salutation be not intended for harry because mr maliphant be not looking at presently ceased gesticulating became suddenly serious a happens to one when friend back be turned have vanished returned to seat by fire harry softly followed stood before waiting to be recognized old man looked up at last nodded head be entertaining friend mr maliphant bob be here only bob have just missed bob replied that be pity never mind can ancient carry memory back twenty year did know last sunday for twenty year ay ay twenty year be only sixty five so then seems long time until be gone twenty year well young man twenty year why be only yesterday mean to time when caroline coppin know old friend caroline be married that be twenty year before more when william fourth died queen victoria then young thing came long to reign over voice sank continued rest of reminiscence to caroline coppin be telling about caroline coppin only wo listen there be nothing more to be got out of recent conversation with bob spirit have muddled for day mixed up caroline with mother grandmother relapsed into silence sat with long pipe unfilled in hand looking into fireplace gone back in imagination to past a old man made sign of conversation rather of disposition to drop off for few minute harry began to look about room on table lay bundle of old letter be a if living dead have be reading together harry took up turned over wondering what secret of long ago be contained in yellow paper with faded ink old man eye be closed took heed of visitor harry standing at table began shamelessly to read letter be mostly letter of young sailor addressed to one apparently good deal older than for abounded in such appellation a ancient venerable old salt so forth young man did not regard correspondent with awe age must inspire rather a gay rollicking spirit who must sympathize with high jinks of younger men even if no longer shared in who be old still delighted treader of flowery path be said by moralist to be planted with frequent pitfall crafty trap old man thought harry must have be admirable guide to youth disciple be apt to learn sometimes letter be signed bob sometimes r coppin sometimes r c harry therefore surmised that writer be other than own uncle bob whose ghost have just missed bob be officer on board of east indiaman spoke not of such commonplace matter a face of ocean voice of tempest only wrote from port told what thing have seen done what have consumed in ardent drink letter be brief seemed a well because if literary skill have be present to dress up effectively subject treated literary monument might have be erected like of world have never seen be indeed

two between must drive mad chapter xxxiv proof in print be quite finished now said daniel fagg blotting last page when began to live with dressmaker angela desiring to find employment have suggested that must rewrite whole of book redraw illustration be not large book even though be stuffed padded with reading of inscription tablet ordinary writer must have made fair copy in fortnight so careful author a daniel so anxious to present work perfect unassailable so slow in mere mechanical art of writing wanted much more than fortnight handwriting like hebrew have be acquired comparatively late in life be therefore rather ponderous have never learned art of writing word leaving other half to be guessed then there be hebrew word took great deal of time to get right equilateral triangle also caused considerable amount of trouble so that be good six week before daniel be ready with fair copy of manuscript be almost a happy in making transcript a have be with original document perhaps more so because be now able to consider great discovery a whole to regard a architect may regard finished work to touch up ornament improve translation be quite complete repeated laying last page in place

bookish unambitious turn of indolent habit of body mentally physically unfitted for life of shop entered ministry in course of time got chapel where remained tolerably satisfied with lot in life

people minister went on in perfunctory way with prayer hymn exposition there certainly did seem to outsider want of heart about service that might have be due to emptiness of pew when came to sermon angela thought preacher spoke looked a if limit of endurance have at last almost arrived must not much longer endure inexpressible dreariness of conventicle be not so be always mildly sad seemed always little bored be use pretending to be eloquent more firework be thrown away a for what have to say congregation always have same thing looked for same thing must have risen in revolt at

have doctrine administered with faithfulness only sixteen altogether yet except pastor seemed to be grimly in earnest inordinately proud of sect be a if emptiness of bench forsaken condition called upon to put on greater show of zeal to persuade that cause be worth fighting for preacher alone seemed to have lost heart people who be accustomed to did not notice despondency then angela while sermon went slowly on began to speculate on condition belonging to sect first of with apparent exception of lady in sealskin husband son whole sixteen perhaps two three be prevented from attending be

sang hymn collection in use be volume printed in new york compiled by committee of connection so that there be manifestly congregation on other side of atlantic living in same discomfort of separation at departure of people rebekah hurried out first waited in doorway to greet angela knew must come day said oh wish have told when be coming so that father might have given one of doctrine sermon what

cruel world filled with greedy taskmaster who exacted uttermost farthing in work paid humblest farthing for reward more than knew father knew that when time came for exchanging haven for cemetery must have to fight hard battle alone being almost friendless girl too shrinking timid to stand up for therefore after rescue at first be in seventh heaven did gratitude love toward rescuer ever know abatement there came time when gratitude be called upon to contend with feeling from very first harry carriage toward nelly be marked by sympathetic brotherly affection really regarded pretty creature

full of claim be condition yes be condition will draw up discharge said mr bunker then one need be wiser harry laughed cool business like compromise of felony pleased may draw up if like opinion of ability be so great that will have to show document to solicitor for approval admiration mr bunker be disconcerted have hoped that be thought saw way never mind quickly recovered said with decision go to lawyer pike in mile end road why be honorable pike friend of yours be be why want to go to tell that have long be wishing to clear up account that have agreed to take two thousand with house mr bunker seemed now chiefly anxious that late deplorable scene must be at once forgotten forgiven said other day be nothing better than common grinder oppressor now when see what honorable trustee be will be sorry said that can tell everybody if like why what be here nephew come home to say 'give house say 'prove title ' did say so how be to know that be nephew then gentleman come who took away say 'he be long lost nephew ' say 'take house young man with accumulation of rent hoarded up for ' why can tell everybody that story will leave to tell bunker own way everybody will believe way of telling story what be more will not go out of way to contradict very good then on understanding withdraw harsh thing may have said to nephew can be good friend again certainly if like said harry fairly ran away for fear of being called upon to make more concession be terrible blow old man sat down wiped forehead to think of two thousand down might have be much worse ah might have be very very much worse have done better than expected when said have paper young man fool mere fool house let for year have never be empty for six month together outside repair be trifle have saved year have now

mr pike solicitor of mile end road doe not belong to story be pity because have many enviable quality further than be connected with harry interview with read document heard story from beginning to end when have quite mastered detail began mildly to express astonishment pity that young man must be such fool be hard because harry really thought have done mighty clever thing have be taken in sir said mr pike in most barefaced impudent manner two thousand pound why mere rent alone without counting interest be three thousand go away sir find out fraudulent impostor tell that will have nothing to do with short of full account complete restitution can not do said harry why not because have passed word think young man said be cabinet maker though look something better yes belong to trade

receipt in full discharge be of age can do if like will draw up for receive money take over house be settled therefore in way harry became rich man with house money in fund a for bunker made greatest mistake in life when sent nephew to mr pike must have known be like ostrich when run head into sand belief from secure retreat that be invisible to hunter for own version of incident be palpably absurd besides mr pike heard harry account of matter therefore though bunker thought to heap coal of fire upon enemy head only succeeded in throwing under foot made kick for who can go upon hot coal foot not be burned good man be now therefore laboring under cloud of prejudice doe not seem to lift though perhaps will live down other event have happened since have operated to prejudice everybody know how received nephew what wicked thing said everywhere about what rumor spread about miss kennedy everybody know that have to disgorge house actually house have appropriated knowledge be common property be extremely unpleasant for mr bunker when take walk abroad to be cruelly assailed by question hit harder than brickbat be hurled at by working men by street boy who stole 'ouse for instance

warmth of kind comfort man confesses with pang that did wrong to send nephew to lawyer who took opportunity when drew up discharge receipt of giving opinion unasked unpaid for a to conduct in connection with trust there must be mistake at about meaning force of opinion oddly enough whenever mr bunker see queen omnibus that dark painted vehicle driven by policeman pas along road think of mr pike opinion return to memory feel just exactly a if bucket of cold water be trickling down back by nape of neck even in warm weather be disagreeable show that lawyer must have spoken very strong word
